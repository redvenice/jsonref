Among other things, they discussed what to do when news of the relationship became public – and Harry advised Mr Markle to avoid the paparazzi at all costs.Mr Markle recalled: ‘Harry told me that I should never go to the press. That it would end in tears. He said, “They will eat you alive.” He was right.’    Prince Harry (pictured) called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suitInstead of taking Harry’s advice, Mr Markle made a secret arrangement to pose for a series of pictures – a decision he now bitterly regrets. The photos made £100,000 for the photographer and a smaller amount for Mr Markle.On Friday, May 11, the MoS informed Kensington Palace of the revelations we were to publish two days later after we discovered CCTV footage of Mr Markle collaborating with the photographer.Harry called Mr Markle to ask if he had co-operated for shots which showed him, among other things, supposedly being fitted for a wedding suit.At this point, Mr Markle admits, he lied to the Prince.After our story appeared, Harry and Meghan called Mr Markle again, though by then he was in hospital recovering from a heart attack. Mr Markle said the Prince told him: ‘If you had listened to me this would never have happened’.Mr Markle said he told Harry: ‘Maybe it would be better for you guys if I was dead… then you could pretend to be sad.’‘Then I hung up.’In hindsight, he admits Harry was ‘absolutely right’ to criticise him. Yet it was Meghan who dealt perhaps the most painful blow when she told her father he would not be allowed to make a speech at the wedding. ‘That hurt,’ he said.Mr Markle added: ‘I’m not mad at Harry. I’m not mad at Meghan. I love them. I wish them well. But as for the rest of it, f*** it. I’m done.’Kensington Palace declined to comment last night.           Prince Harry and Meghan Markle after their wedding at St George\u0027s Chapel on May 19"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/01/4ED66C3600000578-0-image-m-25_1533427820257.jpg","title":"Why Great British Bake judge Prue Leith sees Paul Hollywood grandad her","story":"    Prue Leith, 78, considers fellow Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood to be a grandfather figure\u0027She’s fed up with the lies\u0027: Paul Hollywood\u0027s wife claims...Bagel tycoon\u0027s son \u0027who stabbed his mother in the face 13...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/12/14/4F0970E700000578-0-image-a-7_1534081038156.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles mother Doria 61 preparing Britain soon month","story":"Make like Meghan in Roland Mouret bardot dressShop now at Harvey NicholsDespite marrying in to the Royal family and now officially being the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle is still staying true to her classic sophisticated style and we love her for it here at Fashion Finder.But rewind to the night before her wedding back in May and as she waved goodbye to normal life Meghan wore this beautiful Roland Mouret dress, which has now thankfully come back in to stock.The designers signature \u0026#39Barwick\u0026#39 dress has the now classic aesthetics we\u0026#39ve come to recognise within the Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s sense of style.

That was their intention all along, she said.Arguing that Ms Ladwa should get nothing, Ms Chapman complained she was used as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who had pressured her into putting the house in joint names.           But the \u0027tempestuous\u0027 relationship foundered, leading to a bitter county court battle over their £1.7m former home near Chingford (pictured)Ruling on the case, Judge Stephen Murch found that it was their \u0027common intention\u0027 on buying the house that it would be jointly owned.And he rejected Ms Chapman\u0027s claim that she only transferred the house into joint names because of Ms Ladwa\u0027s \u0027undue influence\u0027.\u0027Having seen Ms Chapman give evidence, I cannot accept that Ms Ladwa was the kind of person who could make her act against her will,\u0027 he said.He added: \u0027Unfortunately, I was left with the impression that Ms Chapman has convinced herself that her version of events is to be preferred, regretting what she now perceives to have been undue generosity when she was in a relationship with Ms Ladwa.\u0027Central London County Court heard the couple began dating in 2000 and they lived together from very early on in their relationship.Ms Chapman worked in her family\u0027s successful building business, while Ms Ladwa was a third-year law student at university.          In court, Ms Chapman (pictured) said she was treated as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who lawyers claimed did not do a \u0027proper day\u0027s work\u0027 during the relationshipHer degree did not lead to a permanent job, nor her time training at cookery college, Le Cordon Bleu, Ms Chapman\u0027s lawyers told the court.The house, near Chingford, was bought for £1.4m in 2007 in Ms Chapman\u0027s name - but within a year transferred into their joint names.It is now thought to be worth £1.7m.The relationship finally ended in 2016, when the judge heard Ms Ladwa gave back her £75,000 engagement rings.The bitter falling out led to a court fight as the women argued over ownership of the house and Ms Chapman sued for the return of alleged loans, designer shoes, bags and jewellery by Cartier, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, and the proceeds of sale of the Aston Martin.In court, Ms Chapman said she was treated as a \u0027cash cow\u0027 by her ex, who lawyers claimed did not do a \u0027proper day\u0027s work\u0027 during the relationship. Ms Ladwa\u0027s only income was a £25,000-a-year allowance from her mother and Ms Chapman said it was only her ex\u0027s incessant nagging that led her to put the house in joint names.Alleging undue influence, she claimed Ms Ladwa behaved like a child begging for a toy, constantly badgering her until she relented.\u0027You get to the point where you are really tired out by hearing the same thing, again and again and again,\u0027 she told the judge.She had loaned almost £400,000 to Ms Ladwa over the years, much of which was used by her ex to trade shares on the stock market, she said.But Ms Ladwa said she had tried hard to get a solicitor\u0027s training contract and she had \u0027never pressured\u0027 and \u0027never hassled\u0027 Ms Chapman over the house.\u0027Bev told me it would be easier to secure the mortgage if it was just in her sole name,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was always going to be our home, our future home. I trusted her.\u0027Her barrister, Anthony Geadah, said it was a relationship of \u0027love and affection\u0027 and Ms Chapman had merely been honouring a \u0027promise\u0027 to a partner of many years when she agreed to put the house in joint names.                            \u0027I accept that they agreed that, although the property was to be purchased in Ms Chapman\u0027s sole name, as soon as the mortgage could be discharged, the property would be transferred to their joint names. From this it must follow that the parties\u0027 common intention at the time of the purchase was that they would be joint owners of it.\u0027                         - Judge Murch Comparing the case with a orce battle, he said Ms Ladwa was \u0027effectively the housewife\u0027, while Ms Chapman was out making money for them to live on. Ruling on the case, Judge Murch said the house had been bought largely with money from their joint bank account, including the proceeds of sale of their previous home.Even if Ms Chapman had made \u0027substantially greater contributions\u0027 to the account, it was a joint account which they must have regarded as joint property.\u0027I accept that they agreed that, although the property was to be purchased in Ms Chapman\u0027s sole name, as soon as the mortgage could be discharged, the property would be transferred to their joint names,\u0027 he said.\u0027From this it must follow that the parties\u0027 common intention at the time of the purchase was that they would be joint owners of it.\u0027He said that, although the couple moved out of the house in 2013, the relationship continued at rented homes in Kew and Covent Garden and there were at least two subsequent marriage proposals.Dismissing Ms Chapman\u0027s claims for return of jewellery, shoes and handbags, together worth around £130,000, he said they had been gifts to Ms Ladwa. Ms Chapman had the \u0027economic strength\u0027 in the relationship and it also was not expected that Ms Ladwa would pay back the money she was given over the years.\u0027These were substantial sums of money. I do not accept however that they at any stage regarded them as a loan,\u0027 he said.\u0027My reason for this is that they were at all times in a relationship in which they understood perfectly that Ms Chapman had greater wealth than Ms Ladwa.\u0027Although Ms Ladwa had been a law student when they met, and I do not doubt that on starting her studies she had intended to pursue a career in the law, this never happened.\u0027It is not clear to me why Ms Ladwa did not secure a training contract. It is clear to me however that they knew that she had not done so. The only income which she said she had was the allowance from her mother.\u0027Ms Chapman knew that Ms Ladwa had no income from a job and over time saw that this was not changing.\u0027It can never have been envisaged that Ms Ladwa would pay them back. I cannot conclude that it was ever discussed.\u0027The judge ruled that the couple agreed when the house was bought that it would be owned by them together and that, in later transferring it into joint names, Ms Chapman had not been subjected to undue pressure.Nothing changed afterwards to suggest that their intentions as to ownership of the property had altered, he found.The decision means the property is held in equal shares by the women and that Ms Ladwa does not have to return the money or the designer goods she was given.The case was considered in a three-day hearing at Central London County Court in January, and the judge\u0027s ruling only now made public.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/07/055B89D6000007D0-0-image-m-4_1534140632883.jpg","title":"Kim Jong tour cattle farm demand workers improve livestock breeding","story":"    Kim the cowboy: North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un visits a cattle farm in Un\u0027gok South Pyongan ProvinceThe images show the dictator inspecting the crops grown on the farm to feed the cattle, before touring the pens where the cows are kept.According to state media, the dictator gave advice and directions to the staff on the cattle farm on how to improve North Korean cow breeds.Kim Jong-un will host South Korea\u0027s President Moon in the...Share this articleHe said he wanted North Korean cows to \u0027rank among the advanced countries\u0027, and ordered that staff \u0027intensify the research work to prevent degeneration of the breeds\u0027.He also promised to make the breeding of North Korean cattle a \u0027state issue\u0027, and apparently offered his own expert advice on how to manage the cows. According to state media, the visit took place on August 5, and was carried out in conjunction with a trip to a fish farm.            He\u0027s a-maized: Kim inspects the grains grown at the stock farm to feed the cattle  Top cows: Kim said he wanted North Korean cows to \u0027rank among the advanced countries\u0027          Giving ordered: Kim ordered staff at the breeding centre to \u0027intensify the research work to prevent degeneration of the breeds\u0027.The pictured were released as North and South Korea agreed to hold a third peace summit in Pyongyang next month, with Kim hosting President Moon Jae-in.The meeting was agreed this morning, following high-level talks in the Demilitarized Zone that ides the peninsula.A trip by the South\u0027s President Moon Jae-in to the North\u0027s capital would be the first such visit for more than a decade, as the diplomatic thaw on the peninsula continues.At the historic first summit between Moon and the North\u0027s leader Kim Jong Un in the Demilitarized zone in April, they agreed the South\u0027s president would visit Pyongyang during the autumn.Today\u0027s high-level talks, taking place on the northern side of the truce village in the Demilitarized Zone, were proposed by the North last week.In his opening statement, the North\u0027s chief delegate Ri Son Gwon said: \u0027As the Pyongyang meeting of the leaders of the north and south is being discussed, I think talking about the issue will provide answers to the wishes of the people.\u0027We have opened an era where we are advancing hand in hand rather than standing in each other\u0027s way.\u0027International sanctions against the North for its nuclear and missile programmes have kept economic cooperation between the two Koreas from taking off, while little progress has been made on the key issue of Pyongyang\u0027s denuclearisation.South Korea\u0027s Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, leading the delegation from Seoul, said it was important that the two Koreas keep \u0027the same mind\u0027.

During Hajj, pilgrims will spend five days praying in Mecca and in the surrounding desert.While Hajj is a demonstration of the togetherness of Islamic people and their devotion to their God Allah, the other pillars of the religion are Shahadah, the belief in God and the acceptance of Muhammad as prophet Salat, prayer Zakat, charity and Sawn, which is fasting.What is the Stoning of the Devil ritual?According to Birmingham Mail, during Hajj millions of pilgrims gather at the Jamarat Bridge which houses three columns representing the devil and Muslims will throw seven pebbles at the largest of the columns.This act, which is referred to as Jamarat, takes place in the position where Ibrahim is thought to have done the same to frighten off the Devil after Allah had told him to sacrifice his son as a proof of faith and this is spot is where the Devil appeared to dissuade him from doing as Allah had asked.The Stoning of the Devil ritual occurs on the third day, which is also known as yawm-ul hajj al-akbar and is the longest day of pilgrimage, as well as the most dangerous. This is also when Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice, also takes place.          Muslim pilgrims around the Kaaba located in the centre of the Haram Sharif Great MosqueJamarat Bridge redesignAlthough the Jamarat Bridge was constructed in 1963, due to an increasing number of pilgrims visiting the site, the Saudi Arabian government decided to demolish the original structure in 2006 and start building the bridge from scratch.Birmingham Mail reported that before the upgrade, crowd density could reach up to 11-15 people per square metre at peak times, but local officials revealed that now there is one square metre per person. The new bridge also has five levels, hundreds of escalators, several lifts, two helipads and air conditioning.Otis Middle East’s Vice President and Managing Director Maged Nagib said: ‘With something this vital to Muslims worldwide, it is vital that outside factors do not disturb the true meaning of Hajj. The reconstruction of the Jamarat Bridge was an important step forward in terms of safety during the pilgrimage.’When is Hajj 2018?Typically the Hajj is a five-day pilgrimage that takes place from the 8th to the 12th day of Dhul-Hijjah, the 12th and final month of the Islamic calendar. In 2018, Hajj will begin on Sunday, August 19 and continue until Friday, August 24.However, like all celebrations in the Muslim calendar, the event start will be determined by the sighting of the moon, which will in turn, reveals the date of Dhul-Hijjah and Eid Al-Adha.          Muslim pilgrims at Mount Arafat where Mohammed is believed to have given his final sermonWhen is Eid al-Adha?Eid al-Adha, the festival of sacrifice which marks when Allah came to Ibrahim in a dream and asked him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience, will begin in the evening of August 21 and end in the evening of August 25.Cycle to work day: All you need to knowNintendo has sold over 700 million gaming consoles to dateAzealia Banks \u0027waited for days\u0027 at Elon Musk\u0027s house for GrimesWWE star Jim \u0027The Anvil\u0027 Neidhart and other wrestlers who died in 2018Hozier London KOKO show: How to get ticketsWho is Omarosa Manigault?

Tony Benn served as an RAF officer, and Jim Callaghan in the Royal Navy. But Corbyn is completely orced from this tradition.From London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this articleThe exposure of his Tunisian escapade in 2014 is just the latest in this unedifying pattern, but the incident is beyond the pale. The 1972 Munich attack was one of the darkest episodes in modern history. It is deeply worrying to know that a man at the top level of public life in Britain felt, only four years ago, that he should attend such an event.What is almost as reprehensible is the attempt by Corbyn and his team to mislead the British public, once the investigation was published. At first his office engaged in the simple tactic of denial.          The Labour leader (pictured on Sky News today on a visit to the Midlands) faced the cameras after a photograph of him holding a wreath near the graves of Palestinian activists linked to the 1972 Munich massacre - which left 11 Israelis dead, emerged. He said he attended a ceremony in Tunis in 2014 because he wanted to commemorate all those killed in atrocitiesAccording to this narrative, the story was a \u0027smear,\u0027 \u0027fake news\u0027 and a \u0027hoax.\u0027 But the weight of evidence made this impossible to sustain. Not only were there photographs of Corbyn holding a wreath near the memorial to the terrorists, but he had also boasted about his attendance at the event in his column in the Morning Star, a communist newspaper.Confronted with this material, Corbyn resorted in interviews yesterday to more prevarication, arguing that he was present at the commemoration but \u0027I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it.\u0027 Such a form of words would be laughable were it not so serious.The Tunisian debacle may be appalling, but sadly, it is no longer shocking. As the MP for Islington North since 1983, Corbyn has been behaving like this throughout his Parliamentary career.When he was an obscure backbencher and serial far-left rebel, his conduct was not so important. But now, he is the Opposition Leader, and exposure of his past is vital. This is a man whose leadership, in less than three years, has not put an end to the vile anti-semitism flourishing within his party, not least because of his own hostility to Israel.Corbyn has regularly shown contempt for the state of Israel, not just its government and its policies, such as in 2010 when he used the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day to host an explosively controversial meeting in Westminster at which nauseating comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany were loudly voiced, something the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) describes as clearly anti-semitic.In 2010 he told a crowd of protestors outside the Israeli Embassy that the position of Gaza was similar to the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the Russian resistance to Nazism in the Second World War. In 2013, he compared Israel\u0027s actions in the West Bank to the Nazi occupation of Europe in World War Two.In the same disreputable vein, in 2012 he used Facebook to express his support for a work in East London by graffiti artist Mear One, who had painted a clearly anti-semitic mural of Jewish plutocrats exploiting the poor.Corbyn told the artist he was \u0027in good company\u0027, a remark for which he later apologised. But precious few other apologies have been forthcoming from Corbyn, not even over his description of the anti-semitic terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u0027our friends\u0027 at an event in Westminster in 2009.Much to the incandescent fury of respected MPs like Margaret Hodge – who lost several members of her own family in the Holocaust – Corbyn\u0027s team has refused to write the globally accepted definition of anti-semitism drawn up by the IHRA into Labour\u0027s rulebook.It is an unbelievable situation in a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice. Indeed, Corbyn likes to portray himself as a passionate warrior against discrimination, but his deeds hardly match his words.           Jeremy Corbyn is pictured with members of a delegation of Palestinian officials at the graveyard in Tunis in 2014, with the wreath which was laid in the cemetery to honour Palestinian \u0027martyrs\u0027.  He has admitted being at the ceremony after initially insisting he was there for a tribute to different PalestiniansHe has been painfully slow to speak out against the anti-semitic abuse meted out to some of his own Labour MPs, like Luciana Berger, by hard-left activists.This is beyond normal Party politics, as this is an issue far beyond the traditional, century-long battle between Conservatives and Labour. I remember the Labour party of old and it saddens me to see it in this state. Thanks to Corbyn\u0027s leadership, decent, moderate Labour activists and MPs are in complete despair at what is happening at the very top of the Labour party.Yet it is only Labour that can sort out this problem. How much longer is the party going to put up with a leader who obfuscates about his past, who equivocates about anti-semitism, who lambasted the BBC for \u0027bias\u0027 for saying Israel has the right to exist, who refuses to be accountable for his actions and who will not even defend his own MPs and members from racist abuse?At such a crucial time for Britain\u0027s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.For the sake of democracy and decency in public life, decent members of the Labour party must ask, is this man fit to lead them and to be leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition?  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/21/4F13040C00000578-0-image-m-46_1534191996763.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyns confusing inconsistent account DID happen wreath laying event","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, pictured here leaving his home yesterday, has given a confusing and contradictory account of his visit to the Tunisian cemetery where the terrorists linked to the Munich Massacre are buriedFrom London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this article    Labour has insisted Jeremy Corbyn (pictured, holding his hands aloft in what appears to be him observing a Muslim prayer with the delegation at the cemetery in 2014) was there to pay his respects to the victims of an Israeli bombing raid in 1985, and not extremists linked to the massacre11:10pm, Sunday August 12, 2018After the widows of Munich victims condemned Mr Corbyn in a front-page Daily Mail story Labour tweets: \u0027The widows are being misled.\u002712:30pm, Monday August 13, 2018Mr Corbyn told ITV News: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some … for those who were killed in Paris in 1992.

By the time of the Munich Olympics, Israel held hundreds of prisoners in its notorious prison system.‘It is widely known, but rarely stated, that the goal of the Munich hostage-taking was not to kill them it was to return the athletes to Israel in return for Israel returning its Palestinian prisoners.‘Many of these prisoners were also young people.          The piece also blamed Israel for provoking the deaths by refusing to cede to the terrorists’ demands to swap the hostages for Palestinian prisoners‘Israel is not known for its merciful treatment of those it dislikes.‘When the Israeli government refused to consider an exchange, the German police, with the Mossad at hand, were pushed into an ill-planned rescue attempt in which some of the hostages (no one knows how many) were killed accidentally by the attackers.’It is not certain, as Miss Weir suggests, that any of the hostages were killed by German police.Her piece continued: ‘The day after the botched and unnecessary “rescue”, Israel launched heavy air attacks against Lebanon and Syria, killing between 200 and 500 Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians.’Miss Weir also criticised the Washington Post for publishing a piece about Russian Jews remembering the murder of the athletes.‘It would have been valuable ... to tell a little about what the Munich incident was about – and about all the tragic victims of violence connected to the event, not just the 11 preferred ones,’ she said.Last night a Labour source said: ‘Jeremy Corbyn condemns the Munich Massacre just as he condemns the 1985 airstrike on PLO’s headquarters.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/00/2B86864F00000578-0-image-a-5_1534115380221.jpg","title":"Pupils dont right Level grades job instead minister says","story":"Markers grading this year\u0027s GCSE and A-Level exams will be...Unemployed law graduate who was ‘lavished with jewels’ by...Share this article    Former nurse Mrs Milton made the comments days before pupils pick up their A-level results on Thursday.

Armchairs that were smart and expensive in the shop window will be dragged away, stained, slashed, ripped up, and finally broken into springs and splinters within days of being placed on the pavement.The bits and pieces left behind then lurk around under the hedges until a civic-minded neighbour (what a relief to know some of them still exist!) takes the trouble to clear them up.Jogger confronts \u0027courier\u0027 hurling parcels into the bushes...Share this articleIn the elegant streets of Clifton, an area of Bristol estate agents would call \u0027affluent and leafy\u0027, on Thursday, I noticed a lady piling plastic chairs and tatty old electrical items outside her front steps.Next to a pine chair with a split seat, a printed sign said \u0027Free stuff\u0027. This was on the pavement outside some of my city\u0027s most glorious Georgian terraces. I asked if she was having a clear-out. \u0027It\u0027s amazing,\u0027 she said, \u0027people will take any old rubbish.\u0027She cast a glance at a rusty wine rack, and added: \u0027I doubt anyone will take this, but my husband\u0027s got three and they\u0027ve got to go.\u0027Last weekend, a bloke round the corner placed two dining chairs by his gate. Their legs were scuffed and the purple cushions had seen better days, but there wasn\u0027t a lot wrong with them.During the night, they inevitably migrated to the lane beside my house. It\u0027s a busy shortcut to the main road and, after the pubs close, just about anything small enough to lift — most often bikes or knackered scooters — is likely to make its way there.These purple chairs were placed at right angles to each other, behind my garden fence. The ground was scattered with cigarette butts and a couple of crushed beer cans. It looked like the people who took them had sat there for quite a while.          If the family don\u0027t need a broken swivel-chair or a chest of drawers with two knobs missing, I can\u0027t imagine why they think anyone else would even want to look at it, let alone trip over itI don\u0027t want the lane turning into an alfresco nightclub. And I\u0027m certainly not keen on anything being left that might be used as a makeshift step-ladder next to my fence. There are enough break-ins in Bristol without giving the burglars a leg-up.True, I could take them back to the house round the corner, but they\u0027ll only end up on the street again. Once a dining suite has hit the skids, there\u0027s no way back.If I had all the time in the world, I might find a local charity and donate the chairs to be \u0027free-cycled\u0027 — given to someone who could genuinely use this tat. It\u0027s hard to think who that could be, though, given that the era in which the poor kissed the hands of the gentry in thanks for their cast-offs ended with Queen Victoria.I can\u0027t put the chairs in a wheelie bin without incurring a hefty fine, and the council will charge me £15 if I want to have them collected. There is an online \u0027freecycling exchange\u0027 in Bristol but it doesn\u0027t seem to be very active.So this morning it falls to me to sling these wretched chairs in the back of the car, along with a broken strimmer and some plastic waste I\u0027ve been meaning to jettison for ages, and take them to the tip — or, to use its proper title, the St Philips Household Waste Recycling Centre.In other words, I\u0027ll end up doing exactly what the owner of the chairs should have done in the first place. I\u0027m saving him the trouble.This cuts to the heart of what middle-class fly-tipping is really about: saving time and effort by getting someone else to do it instead. It\u0027s not dumping rubbish: it\u0027s dumping a problem.It\u0027s why people pile tatty paperbacks and children\u0027s picture books by the garden gate, with a sign that says: \u0027Help yourself, happy reading!\u0027 Anyone who genuinely wanted their dog-eared Harry Potters to give entertainment to a new generation would take half an hour and go to the nearest charity bookshop — there are at least a dozen within a mile of my house.Instead, people just strew their driveway with heaps of books and plastic toys, making the street look like an unattended car boot sale. Even if it rains, the books stay there for days, quietly rotting.Sometimes, the middle-class fly-tipper isn\u0027t even generous enough to give away their rubbish.Earlier this year I came upon a lounge unit of drawers and shelves, with a table for a TV, propped up against the wall of a house. A scrawled sign said, \u0027£25 or nearest offer\u0027.          The most galling thing is that these smug litterbugs pretend they\u0027re doing a community service by offering their detritus for freeThe Formica was stained with tea-mug rings and peeled back to expose frayed chipboard at the corners. The whole contraption tilted sideways, as if it were too exhausted to stand up straight. No one in their right mind would pay £25 for a stranger\u0027s scrap.If anyone\u0027s to blame for the rise of the middle-class fly-tipper, it\u0027s Kirstie Allsopp. She\u0027s not actually middle-class, by the way — she\u0027s the daughter of a hereditary peer, the sixth Baron Hindlip. But she did popularise the craze for foisting worn-out furniture on people, with a TV show about \u0027upcycling\u0027 called Fill Your House For Free.Kirstie\u0027s scheme was to take sagging sofas and decrepit kitchen cupboards, give them a lick of paint and pretend they were lovely. She broke a painter\u0027s stepladder in two and nailed it to the wall as a pair of wonky shelves. A rusty barbecue pan, sprayed gold, became a lampshade.Stupidest of all, she had a tradesman saw an iron bath in two. When he had glued a couple of cushions into one end, Kirstie announced it was \u0027an upcycled easy-chair\u0027.Reviewing the show for my Mail TV column four years ago, I pointed out this was sheer pretension. Anyone who can afford to hire a van and collect some grotty old bath could afford instead to get a big comfy beanbag from a warehouse shop.Kirstie and her trendy tribe of \u0027upcyclers\u0027 have given a licence to lazy middle-class house-holders to dump their junk on the street and feel they\u0027ve done the world a favour.So here\u0027s a message for them all. I don\u0027t want your old furniture. And neither does anyone else. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/11/4F103CDB00000578-0-image-m-16_1534155917744.jpg","title":"Tenants able buy one cent home year new proposals","story":"    Tenants will be able to buy tiny shares of their home every year to build up a nest egg over time, ministers will announce today (file photo)The minister said: ‘Providing high-quality and well-managed social housing is a core priority for this Government.‘Our green paper offers a landmark opportunity for major reform to improve fairness, quality and safety for residents living in social housing across the country.

Tony Benn served as an RAF officer, and Jim Callaghan in the Royal Navy. But Corbyn is completely orced from this tradition.From London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this articleThe exposure of his Tunisian escapade in 2014 is just the latest in this unedifying pattern, but the incident is beyond the pale. The 1972 Munich attack was one of the darkest episodes in modern history. It is deeply worrying to know that a man at the top level of public life in Britain felt, only four years ago, that he should attend such an event.What is almost as reprehensible is the attempt by Corbyn and his team to mislead the British public, once the investigation was published. At first his office engaged in the simple tactic of denial.          The Labour leader (pictured on Sky News today on a visit to the Midlands) faced the cameras after a photograph of him holding a wreath near the graves of Palestinian activists linked to the 1972 Munich massacre - which left 11 Israelis dead, emerged. He said he attended a ceremony in Tunis in 2014 because he wanted to commemorate all those killed in atrocitiesAccording to this narrative, the story was a \u0027smear,\u0027 \u0027fake news\u0027 and a \u0027hoax.\u0027 But the weight of evidence made this impossible to sustain. Not only were there photographs of Corbyn holding a wreath near the memorial to the terrorists, but he had also boasted about his attendance at the event in his column in the Morning Star, a communist newspaper.Confronted with this material, Corbyn resorted in interviews yesterday to more prevarication, arguing that he was present at the commemoration but \u0027I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it.\u0027 Such a form of words would be laughable were it not so serious.The Tunisian debacle may be appalling, but sadly, it is no longer shocking. As the MP for Islington North since 1983, Corbyn has been behaving like this throughout his Parliamentary career.When he was an obscure backbencher and serial far-left rebel, his conduct was not so important. But now, he is the Opposition Leader, and exposure of his past is vital. This is a man whose leadership, in less than three years, has not put an end to the vile anti-semitism flourishing within his party, not least because of his own hostility to Israel.Corbyn has regularly shown contempt for the state of Israel, not just its government and its policies, such as in 2010 when he used the occasion of Holocaust Memorial Day to host an explosively controversial meeting in Westminster at which nauseating comparisons between Israel and Nazi Germany were loudly voiced, something the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) describes as clearly anti-semitic.In 2010 he told a crowd of protestors outside the Israeli Embassy that the position of Gaza was similar to the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad during the Russian resistance to Nazism in the Second World War. In 2013, he compared Israel\u0027s actions in the West Bank to the Nazi occupation of Europe in World War Two.In the same disreputable vein, in 2012 he used Facebook to express his support for a work in East London by graffiti artist Mear One, who had painted a clearly anti-semitic mural of Jewish plutocrats exploiting the poor.Corbyn told the artist he was \u0027in good company\u0027, a remark for which he later apologised. But precious few other apologies have been forthcoming from Corbyn, not even over his description of the anti-semitic terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah as \u0027our friends\u0027 at an event in Westminster in 2009.Much to the incandescent fury of respected MPs like Margaret Hodge – who lost several members of her own family in the Holocaust – Corbyn\u0027s team has refused to write the globally accepted definition of anti-semitism drawn up by the IHRA into Labour\u0027s rulebook.It is an unbelievable situation in a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice. Indeed, Corbyn likes to portray himself as a passionate warrior against discrimination, but his deeds hardly match his words.           Jeremy Corbyn is pictured with members of a delegation of Palestinian officials at the graveyard in Tunis in 2014, with the wreath which was laid in the cemetery to honour Palestinian \u0027martyrs\u0027.  He has admitted being at the ceremony after initially insisting he was there for a tribute to different PalestiniansHe has been painfully slow to speak out against the anti-semitic abuse meted out to some of his own Labour MPs, like Luciana Berger, by hard-left activists.This is beyond normal Party politics, as this is an issue far beyond the traditional, century-long battle between Conservatives and Labour. I remember the Labour party of old and it saddens me to see it in this state. Thanks to Corbyn\u0027s leadership, decent, moderate Labour activists and MPs are in complete despair at what is happening at the very top of the Labour party.Yet it is only Labour that can sort out this problem. How much longer is the party going to put up with a leader who obfuscates about his past, who equivocates about anti-semitism, who lambasted the BBC for \u0027bias\u0027 for saying Israel has the right to exist, who refuses to be accountable for his actions and who will not even defend his own MPs and members from racist abuse?At such a crucial time for Britain\u0027s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.For the sake of democracy and decency in public life, decent members of the Labour party must ask, is this man fit to lead them and to be leader of Her Majesty\u0027s Opposition?  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/21/4F13040C00000578-0-image-m-46_1534191996763.jpg","title":"Jeremy Corbyns confusing inconsistent account DID happen wreath laying event","story":"    Jeremy Corbyn, pictured here leaving his home yesterday, has given a confusing and contradictory account of his visit to the Tunisian cemetery where the terrorists linked to the Munich Massacre are buriedFrom London letter bombs to bullet-riddled bodies in Munich:...Share this article    Labour has insisted Jeremy Corbyn (pictured, holding his hands aloft in what appears to be him observing a Muslim prayer with the delegation at the cemetery in 2014) was there to pay his respects to the victims of an Israeli bombing raid in 1985, and not extremists linked to the massacre11:10pm, Sunday August 12, 2018After the widows of Munich victims condemned Mr Corbyn in a front-page Daily Mail story Labour tweets: \u0027The widows are being misled.\u002712:30pm, Monday August 13, 2018Mr Corbyn told ITV News: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some … for those who were killed in Paris in 1992.

Mr Corbyn appears to be adjusting the wreath, which is being held by Salman El Herfi, the Palestinian ambassador in Tunisia. He is still standing by the graves of the men linked to the terror attackOn another dramatic day yesterday:Families of Israeli athletes killed in the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre called on Mr Corbyn to apologise and step down as Labour leader.It emerged that the Stop the War campaign group published an incendiary article playing down the brutal killings as unintentional while Mr Corbyn was its chairman.The BBC largely ignored the revelations about Mr Corbyn\u0027s visit to the graves of the Black September terrorists – while giving extensive coverage to the week-old row about Boris Johnson\u0027s burka remarks.Mr Netanyahu criticised Mr Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony where a wreath was laid in memory of Palestinians suspected of being behind the Munich Olympics massacre.The Israeli PM accused the Labour leader of laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the 1972 atrocity in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed, after photos published by the Mail on Saturday showed him holding the floral tribute at the foot of the memorial.          Jeremy Corbyn raises his hands in what appears to be an Islamic prayer position as he stands beside other politicians. A source said he was not praying but \u0027copying the others out of respect\u0027Writing on Twitter, Mr Netanyahu said: \u0027The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – Left, Right and everything in between.\u0027The second reference was to a video which surfaced last week which appeared to show Mr Corbyn likening the situation in the West Bank to occupations during the Second World War.Soon after Mr Netanyahu\u0027s tweet, however, Mr Corbyn hit back. He wrote on Twitter: \u0027Israeli PM @Netanyahu\u0027s claims about my actions and words are false. \u0027What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.\u0027The Labour leader then tweeted: \u0027The nation state law sponsored by Netanyahu\u0027s government discriminates against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority.           Mr Corbyn looks at a plaque which honours Khalaf, al-Omari and Abdel-Hamid. It describes them as ‘martyrs’ who were assassinated in 1991. A wreath that looks very similar to the one Mr Corbyn was holding in the earlier two photographs is seen beside the plaque, circled \u0027I stand with the tens of thousands of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel demonstrating for equal rights at the weekend in Tel Aviv.\u0027Earlier, Mr Corbyn had finally been forced to address the growing row during a visit to Walsall, but his attempt to calm the situation served only to inflame it. Asked about the controversy, Mr Corbyn said: \u0027A wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended the conference to those that were killed in Paris in 1992.\u0027I was present when it was laid. I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it (laying it). I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it.\u0027Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger last night hit back at Mr Corbyn\u0027s attempted explanation.           The Israeli PM condemned Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter and urged those of the left and right to unite to in criticising the Labour leader           Mr Corbyn has hit back at Mr Netanyahu\u0027s claims, calling them \u0027false\u0027 on Twitter          Mr Corbyn also blasted the Israeli PM for laws sponsored by his government that \u0027discriminate against Israel\u0027s Palestinian minority\u0027      \u0027We hope that all Labour MPs, members and those in the media will show the integrity that this case demands and continue to hold Mr Corbyn to account over this appalling incident.\u0027 Jennifer Gerber, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said: \u0027Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s latest statement is a further insult to those savagely murdered at Munich and their bereaved relatives.\u0027He says he was paying respect to victims of terrorism when there is clear photographic evidence of him holding a wreath.

As far back as 28,000BC we were carving our image into rocks in Brazil, and this obsession with our own appearance has remained popular ever since: in 2017, 8.1 million visitors traipsed round the Louvre to stare at the lingering smile of the Mona Lisa, while every single day, social media is awash with selfies.Which is why the aptly named Heads Roll at Graves Gallery, Sheffield – a show that focuses entirely on portraits and the depiction of the human form – is a mesmerising treasure trove. Curated by Sheffield-based artist Paul Morrison (best known for monochrome botanical paintings, prints and sculptures), the exhibition includes a dazzling array of portraiture ning over 400 years and features 60 artists working across print, paint, sculpture and word art.Making good use of both Museums Sheffield’s archive and his personal connections in the art world, Morrison unites the likes of Michael Craig-Martin, Luc Tuymans and Julian Opie with Rembrandt van Rijn, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Carlo Saraceni. He painted the white walls of the gallery grey, so the many “heads in boxes” – as Morrison calls them – pop out. Eyes, expressions, silent stories float across the space, recreating that sense of intimacy that comes when face to face with another human being.The hang, which Morrison refers to as “cheeky”and “engaging” is as provocative as the works in the frames. Blending classical arrangements with salon style clustering, Morrison draws out surprising dialogues between the pieces. Ian Anderson’s Portrait of a Norse God after a Battle with his Elder Sister sits alongside Carlo Saraceni’s Judith with the Head of Holofernes. Both of them contain surprising violence. At first glance, Saraceni appears to have painted a beautiful woman with soft features but on closer inspection a decapitated head appears in her hands. Anderson rewrites the familiar children’s song “head, shoulders, knees and toes”, replacing “eyes” with the rather more sinister “eye”. Where has the other eye gone?In the second gallery, Jessica Diamond’s large-scale word art reads: “Oh small small head  beautiful brown bead  pink white orb  speak!” The text refers to the emergence of a baby’s head during childbirth. Directly next to it Glenn Brown’s arresting Die Mutter des Kunstlers reveals a decapitated woman or mother, as the title suggests. The swirling blue painting is punctuated by rich splashes of red and the mother’s wounds in her hands, feet and side are reminiscent of Christ on the cross. Side by side, these two works encapsulate the whole of life – as one arrives in the world, the other exits it.Morrison’s extensive exploration of portraiture acknowledges that representations of humanity can be found in much more than two eyes, a nose and a mouth. His interrogation of this timeless art form stretches far and wide, reaching Richard Wentworth’s glass pitcher containing a book, Caroline McCarthy’s abstract painted squares and Mary Obering’s spherical, striped disk. These are portraits because the artists deem it so. Morrison did not request any specific pieces of art, instead he invited the artist to submit a portrait in whatever format they desired.Each artwork – whether it is a bust of a head or a row of squares smoking a cigarette – says something about what it means to exist. The portraits in Heads Roll reveal what it is to be human, which is why it will be a great hit, because we can have hours of narcissistic fun under the guise of a cultural activity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8df29ab88e0b56497e37013a1a05c9ee45187241/0_0_3500_2180/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016964253ec751097d06e60d5e5809a0 880w","title":"how free should novelists be to imagine radically different lives","story":"For me – a middle-aged British man writing in the voice of a teenage Egyptian girl signing up with Isis – this is a tough question. Here is how I answer itMy new novel may need justifying. Half of it is narrated by Sofia, a 17-year-old girl born in Cairo I’m a 47-year-old man who has never lived outside the UK. More to the point, the story opens with Sofia arriving in Syria to join Islamic State – a long way from any experience of my own. Privately, I have been asked what gives me the right to tell this story. With the book newly out, I expect to have to answer this publicly. It’s a good question.And a vexed one, debated with understandable heat over the last few years. One side sees an act of presumption or, worse, exploitation: those who are used to having an audience for their stories usurp the experience, culture and identity of those who are never heard. To object to this is right. Control the past and you control the future, as Orwell tells us the fictional stories we tell shape us as powerfully as history does. This responsibility ought to sit with the owners of the stories – not only because it is morally right, but also because their chances of being heard diminish every time someone tells their story for them. Like a child who never gets a word in because their older siblings speak for them, they are robbed of the chance to find their own voice.The other side responds with logic that appears irrefutable. If a writer can write only what they know, they will be confined to writing about themselves, or their experience of others. They’ll be barred from imagining what it is to be someone else. The boundaries shrink to almost nothing, and literature dies: no Anna Karenina, no Molly Bloom, no Frankenstein. Jane Austen might have shrunk from creating Darcy. If some extension is allowed, how far can it go, and who decides? My last novel focused on a Jewish New Yorker in his late 50s, wealthy, single and living in London. I’m not Isaac Hammer any more than I am Sofia, but my life is probably a little closer to his, at least in appearance. No one ever remarked on that gap. So is that OK? Can I write a female character, provided she has a similar background to my own? A gay character? Can I move up a class, or down one? These shifting grades are so numerous that the exercise quickly becomes ludicrous.But both positions are justified. Novelists must stretch their imaginations into the lives and minds of others. At the same time, this is an invasive process that does involve a degree of appropriation. The writer takes something for their use, and to any community that has suffered long misrepresentation, this will seem no different from the thousand thefts and degradations that have gone before. Novelists are familiar with the moral shape of this relationship with the world. What we create isn’t generated from nothing everything that comes out has at some point gone in. It follows that the richer the inputs, the better the odds that good work will result. This is why families and friends are rightly wary of us, and why Graham Greene said there was no such thing as a boring lunch, just an opportunity to gather material. If we’re doing it right, we don’t just borrow the experience of others, we absorb it and make it our own. We steal. That novelists do not sit with the politicians and the bankers in popular esteem suggests there is a contract in place, that the world acknowledges that the benefit outweighs the intrusion. It is for good reason that most cultures prize their novelists (and that some governments fear them). But the recent debate around cultural appropriation suggests that, at its edges, the terms of the contract are no longer clear or reasonable. The world has changed, old assumptions no longer hold and novelists, like everyone else, need to move with the times. Writing fiction deserves no special dispensation.So is there a way to navigate this difficult territory? In the words of someone who challenged me on this point, why did I think it was OK to write this book?The first thing to say is that the decision wasn’t taken rashly. In a sense, it wasn’t really taken at all. I’d been reading about Isis for general research, and had spent days wandering through the blogs and Twitter accounts of English-speaking volunteers. The women’s stories were the most fascinating. While the men tended to be escaping something that ailed them (addiction, criminal behaviour, mental illness) on a crude promise to transform their lives (with a car, a wife, a gun), the women’s motivations were more erse, and more complex. So many possessed a streak of striking radicalism, a reasoned disgust with the west brought to a pitch by the horror of the Syrian war and channelled into a genuine commitment to building an Islamic utopia, the caliphate. Some of the young women were especially bright, with futures full of conventional promise. As a generalisation with plenty of exceptions, the men were pursuing a fantasy, the women an ideal.From those many voices, one began to form in my head – certain and unsure at once, zealous, as clever as it was naive. As an exercise I started to set the voice down, which would eventually become Sofia’s half of this book. Any questions around my right to write it only occurred to me once a rough draft was complete. I knew the story and its expression were both as fully imagined, and therefore as responsible, as I could make them. The difference between a good book and a bad one so often lies in how sensitively the writer can inhabit a character. I wanted to understand Sofia, to give a true account of how she comes to see her mistakes – not to exploit her notoriety. That’s important, but not critical. My intentions may not be relevant to the political question of appropriation well-meaning theft is still theft. But here some special conditions applied. No one was writing Sofia’s story and, crucially, there seemed little prospect that anyone would. Dozens of non-fiction books explored the process of radicalisation, the strange hold of Isis, the reality of living in the caliphate. Excellent research has been conducted into women’s motivations for making the journey to Syria. Inidual accounts of the women themselves have been confined to news reporting – and even this was patchy, because if they managed to leave Isis, they often found themselves presented with handcuffs, not publishing contracts. (And since the collapse of the territorial Islamic State, women have been tried in their hundreds by the Iraqi government and almost invariably sentenced, after perfunctory trials, to long imprisonment or death). With good reason, perhaps, the Sofias of the world would not be contributing to the narrative.Sofia’s story, though, is worth hearing. We do need to think about it. Not because it will change our understanding of history or radicalisation, but because it might seem a little less alien once we’ve heard it, and in the process tell us something about ourselves. The sickness she sees in the world is real, and her rejection of it is a teenage rebellion – extreme in degree, but no different in kind. At a panel discussion I attended on the phenomenon of the “jihadi brides” (a phrase no one present liked), one of the audience concluded: it’s punk. And while he wasn’t wholly right, he wasn’t exactly wrong, either. Sofia goes to Raqqa because she wants to destroy the world and rebuild it in her image. Many of us will have felt the same, if more mildly many of us with teenage children will see them convulsed by similar energies. When I began to write the book, Sofia presented a mystery and a danger that I was not equipped to understand. By the time I finished the final draft, I had learned that more connected us than separated us. My hope is that anyone who reads the book will take a similar series of steps. And that’s where the justification lies, I think. Fiction remains the best means we have of finding connection where there seems to be none and the novel, of all forms, encourages a search that’s deep and sustained. By reading (or writing) one, you’ve travelled somewhere else. You’ve moved, if only slightly, towards others. In a world that finds and increasingly exploits ision and difference, this is an invaluable, precious exercise.Writers should not abuse this weighty privilege. If they are going to start a long way from home, they need to follow some rules. Mine might be: do it with the most generous intent try to write it well and fully and, without good reason, don’t take stories that others are already telling. But this privilege needs to remain possible. Restrict writers from writing certain stories and we introduce ision into a process that exists to break down ision – and now is not the right time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282c8c9ab77bf1097a3a3c2a6368b0ddedd8f358/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188a8a4764be7519e50d4c91dbb1ba95","title":"not the booker prize shortlist three dreams in the key of g marc nash","story":"Last year’s judges have finalised the 2018 shortlist, adding Marc Nash’s Three Dreams in the Key of G. Now we’re on the hunt for three new judges ...We now have a complete shortlist for the 2018 Not the Booker prize. Our excellent panel of judges from last year have added Three Dreams in the Key of G by Marc Nash, as our wildcard entry. It sounds like a daring experimental novel that should add considerable interest to our list – but don’t take it from me, take it from our three judges:Hannah Bruce calls it “a truly unique book – a tour de force of advanced literature. Nash manages to intertwine three interesting narrators, while also expressing the emotion of science. Three Dreams is a book capable of standing out in any collection or shortlist, and will likely not be forgotten.”Yvain Poncet says: “Three Dreams is a unique book, challenging and rewarding in equal measures. The style is ambitious, the novel accomplished. The form and the development of the (very different) inner voices displays the author’s willingness to push the boundaries of his writing, and to explore territories that could only be so through a novel. I can’t wait to hear this year’s judges take on our choice.”And Jackie Law (who has also written a detailed review on her blog) writes: “Three Dreams is playful and clever in its use of language, of science, and its portrayal of relationships. It observes man’s habits and thinking, offering the reasoning of inner voices that rarely find clear expression. The interplay of words and their multiple meanings weave together the three strands of the story. The writing is rich, at times complex, but ultimately entertaining.”So our complete 2018 shortlist now looks like this: Sealed by Naomi BoothDark Pines by Will DeanRaising Sparks by Ariel KahnSweet Fruit, Sour Land by Rebecca LeyThe Ruin by Dervla McTiernanThree Dreams in the Key of G by Marc NashAs we’re reading in alphabetical order, I’ll be reviewing Sealed by Naomi Booth next week, with a review to follow each week.I hope you’ll join me, especially because we are once again on the look out for judges.

Our judges are always a vital part of our process – and their wisdom always makes the discussions more lively.

Authorities haven’t so far specified whether any homeless people were among them, but according to the regional department of public health, the majority were aged over 50, lived alone, and had underlying physical or mental health problems. None had air conditioning. Montreal coroner Jean Brochu told reporters that many of the bodies examined by his team “were in an advanced state of decay, having sometimes spent up to two days in the heat before being found”.It was the poor and isolated who quietly suffered the most in the heat – a situation echoed in overheated cities across the world. In the US, immigrant workers are three times more likely to die from heat exposure than American citizens. In India, where 24 cities are expected to reach average summertime highs of at least 35C (95F) by 2050, it is the slum dwellers who are most vulnerable. And as the global risk of prolonged exposure to deadly heat steadily rises, so do the associated risks of human catastrophe.“Dying in a heatwave is like being slowly cooked,” said lead author Professor Camilo Mora at the time of publication. “It’s pure torture. The young and elderly are at particular risk, but we found that this heat can kill soldiers, athletes, everyone.”The year 2018 is set to be among the hottest since records began, with unprecedented peak temperatures engulfing the planet, from 43C (109F) in Baku, Azerbaijan, to the low 30s across Scandinavia. In Kyoto, Japan, the mercury did not dip below 38C (100F) for a week. In the US, an unusually early and humid July heatwave saw 48.8C (120F) in Chino, inland of Los Angeles. Residents blasted their air conditioners so much they caused power shortages.Urban areas are reaching these killer temperatures faster than those that are less populated. Cities absorb, create and radiate heat. Asphalt, brick, concrete and dark roofs act like sponges for heat during the day and emit warmth at night. Air conditioning is a lifesaver for those who can afford it, but it makes the streets even hotter for those who can’t.“Urban heat islands, combined with an ageing population and increased urbanisation, are projected to increase the vulnerability of urban populations, especially the poor, to heat-related health impacts in the future,” a US government assessment warned.Air pollution is more deadly in these areas, too, as nitrous oxides generate ozone when heated by the sun, inflaming airways and increasing mortality risk. “These problems are worse,” says Benmarhnia, “for vulnerable or low-income populations living near traffic in poor housing with no air conditioning.”But air conditioning will remain out of reach for many, even as it increasingly becomes a necessity. In 2014, Public Health England raised concerns that “the distribution of cooling systems may reflect socioeconomic inequalities unless they are heavily subsidised,” adding that rising fuel costs could further exacerbate this. And when we need to use less energy and cool the planet, not just our homes and offices, relying upon air conditioning is not a viable long-term plan – and certainly not for everyone.Most of the research into heatwaves and public health has focused on western countries Benmarhnia says more studies have been done on the city of Phoenix, Arizona, than the entire continent of Africa. But the problem is global, and especially pronounced across urban slums such as the ashwiyyat in Cairo, where temperatures during the city’s five-month-long summers have peaked at 46C (115F).Um Hamad, 41, works as a cleaner and lives with his family in a small flat in Musturad in the city’s north. Though he considers them lucky to live on the relatively cool first floor, “in Cairo everything is suffocating”, he says. Hamad use fans and water to keep cool inside, but the water bill is becoming expensive . “There’s always that trick of sleeping on the floor, and we wear cotton clothes ,” he says. “The temperatures are harder to deal with for women who wear the hijab, so I always tell my daughters to wear only two layers and to wear bright colours.”In a tight-knit cluster of urban dwellings in Giza, to Cairo’s south, Yassin Al-Ouqba, 42, a train maintenance worker, lives in a house built from a mixture of bricks and mud-bricks. In August, he says, it becomes “like an oven”. “I have a fan and I place it in front of a plate of ice so that it spreads cold air throughout the room. I spread cold water all over the sheets.”In tropical Manila in the Philippines, where highs above 30C are intensified by stifling humidity, air conditioning is a luxury even for those in medical care. The Dr Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital is said to have one of the world’s busiest maternity wards, with free contraception only recently made available in the predominantly Catholic country.An air-conditioned private room costs 650 Philippine pesos per night – less than £10, but far beyond the means of most mothers-to-be, who end up in wards reliant on fans buzzing softly on wall mounts. “These fans work nonstop 24 hours a day, so they never last a year,” says Maribel Bote, a nurse at the hospital for 28 years.The problem is compounded by regular overcrowding: in the maternity ward, known as ground zero of the country’s overpopulation crisis, as many as five mothers have been forced to share one bed. “It gets hellish in the summer – the fans blow hot air,” says Bote. “You’ll see the mothers using paper fans to cool themselves.”In Cambodia, which has seen devastating heatwaves and drought in recent years, surviving the heat is as much a question of status for prisoners as it is for civilians. In the early 2000s Chao Sophea, 30, spent more than two years at Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison after being convicted on drug charges, which she denies. At the time she was three months pregnant Sophea’s child spent its first year in an overcrowded cell designated for pregnant women and new mothers.“It was actually a steaming room,” says Sophea today. “I was using a fan made of a palm leaf to cool my baby down – that was what I could afford. There was a tiny hole in the wall, but can you imagine how much air you would absorb in such a crowded space? We made a request for an electric fan, but it never arrived.”An environmental activist who wishes to remain anonymous says he shared a cell of about four square metres with at least 25 other men when he was held in Prey Sar’s men’s wing earlier this year. “We slept like smoked fish on a skewer. There was no air conditioning, not even a fan.”Others may be able to secure better conditions. A 2015 report by the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights stated that “some prisons reportedly house ‘VIP cells’ for well-connected prisoners or those able to pay for single-cell accommodation,” and these are believed to be air conditioned.On a plain north of Amman, some 80,000 Syrians live in the Za’atari refugee camp, a semi-permanent urban settlement set up six years ago and now considered Jordan’s fourth-largest city. Hamda Al-Marzouq, 27, arrived three years ago, fleeing airstrikes on her neighbourhood in the outskirts of Damascus.Her husband had gone missing during the war, and she was desperate to save her young son and extended family. Eight of them now live in a prefabricated shelter, essentially a large metal box, which Al-Marzouq says turns into an oven during the summer.“It’s a desert area, and we’re suffering,” she says by phone from the camp. “We have different ways of coping. We wake in the early morning and soak the floor with water. Then we sprinkle water on ourselves.” There is no daytime electricity, so fans are useless. When power does arrive at night, the desert has already cooled.Many days, her family will wait until the evening to walk outside, wrapping wet towels around their heads. But the biggest problem are sandstorms, which can arrive violently during the summer months and engulf the camp for days. “We have to close the caravan windows,” she says, adding the room then gets hotter. “It’s suffocating. We soak the towels and try to breathe through them.”Al-Marzouq’s five-year-old son suffers respiratory problems and keeps getting infections, while asthma is rife across the camp.Water has also been an issue, with demand in northern Jordan – one of the most water-scarce countries in the world – surging following the refugee arrivals. A Unicef-led operation will see all households connected to a water network by October, which Al-Marzouq says has been a significant help.“We used to collect water with jerry cans and had to carry it for long distances. Now, with the water network being operational, things are much easier. We don’t have to fight in a long queue to get our share of water. Now there is equity.”Across the board, lack of equality has been found to feed the urban furnaces. The US researchers who in 2013 uncovered the racial ide in urban heat vulnerability discovered that the more segregated a city was, the hotter it was for everyone. Rachel Morello-Frosch, one of the co-authors, told the LA Times at the time that “this pattern of racial segregation appears to increase everyone’s risk of living in a heat-prone environment”.Treating cities as a whole, ghettos and all, is a more effective way to tackle extreme urban heat, they found. Researchers recommended planting more trees and increasing light-coloured surfaces to reduce the overall heat island effect, adding that urban planning to mitigate future extreme heat “should proactively incorporate an environmental justice perspective and address racialethnic disparities”.Working to break social isolation, says Benmarhnia, “is a win-win situation”, with the added benefit of bringing the “invisible” people most at risk – like the homeless, and illegal immigrants – back into the community, where they can be looked after.In at least one of the world’s hottest countries, steps are starting to be taken. India recently announced that a series of common-sense public health interventions have led to an enormous reduction in heat-related deaths – from 2,040 in 2015, to a little over 200 in 2017. Successful measures included unlocking the gates to public parks during the day, distributing free water, and painting the roofs of slum communities white, knocking 5C off internal temperatures.Montreal first implemented a similar heat action plan in 2004, reducing mortality on hot days by 2.52 deaths per day, but as the heat waves intensify, it is likely that this will need to be reassessed. Nadler says the devastating impacts of global warming are only just beginning to dawn on everyone. “Cities will have to rethink how we prepare for these emergencies and what we’re able to offer to all of our citizens – from the most affluent, to the most vulnerable.”Additional reporting by Ruth Michaelson with Adham Youssef in Cairo, Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem, Carmela Fonbuena in Manila and Holly Robertson in Phnom PenhFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat. There’s also the Shakespeare Garden, planted entirely with flowers from the Bard’s time. Don’t leave without finding the actual secret garden (no need for a robin to let you in though – it’s all open for you).Kingstanding Beacon, BirminghamWith Spaghetti Junction and The Bull Ring, Birmingham has a reputation for being a sprawling concrete jungle. But nestled between housing estates off an unmarked path is Kingstanding Beacon. Known locally as The Pimple, the second-highest point in Birmingham has a panoramic view of trees, hills and more trees. Just the place for getting up and away from it all.Pure Land Japanese Garden, NottinghamshireIf you thought the closest you’d come to Japan in Nottingham was a maki roll at Yo! Sushi, swing by this soothing meditation garden, complete with Japanese-inspired water features, pagodas, crystals and koi-carp-filled ponds. Created more than 30 years ago by Buddhist monk Maitreya, who still runs personal meditation classes, the garden is the setting for magical events, from Japanese tea ceremonies to lamplit evening concerts.St John’s Gardens, ManchesterFormerly the site of a graveyard, this mini oasis for city workers, visitors and locals boasts an urban orchard of crab apple trees, manicured flowerbeds and Manchester poplars to shade under. There are also plenty of benches for you to recuperate on after you’ve wandered around the Museum of Science and Industry next door.Goldney Gardens, BristolThis ornate 18th-century garden, tucked behind Goldney House in Clifton Wood, is hiding some big secrets behind its ordinary-looking stone walls. And what might those be, you ask? There’s a heritage orchard, an ornamental garden, an orangery, a rotunda and bastion, for starters. Then you can check out the Corinthian columns and explore an elaborate, shell and fossil-lined grotto, complete with lioness and river god – a perfect spot for your very own Jane Austen moment. Tours of Goldney Gardens are run on various dates throughout the summer till 23 August and can be booked online.Bonnington Square Pleasure Garden, LondonOnce part of the 17th-century Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, this plot of land became a bombsite, then a derelict playground dominated by dog poo, before it was imaginatively re-designed in the 1990s by a group of local residents, led by film-maker Evan English. It now features a 9-metre-high Industrial Revolution iron waterwheel, a huge Helping Hand sculpture and lush sub-tropical plants. And zero dog poo.Cambo Gardens, FifeWith winding paths, fast-flowing streams and swarms of butterflies, the walled, wild gardens of Cambo House seem straight out of a storybook. Eclectic in design – think cascades of roses and carpets of more than 300 varieties of snowdrops – the garden has been specially planted to reward the visitor no matter what season it is. Views of the sea at sunset are particularly Instagrammable.Rooftop of the Dolphin Shopping Centre, PooleThis shopping centre in Poole has a bit of a buzz about it recently, thanks to a new sustainable roof garden, complete with two beehives. Not only do bees here help with local pollination, they also produce the honey that is sold in the centre, with all the proceeds going to charity. Tended to by shopping centre staff, the garden has been made entirely from recycled materials, and there are big plans to grow veg up there too.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Such is the menu, the paean to my granny’s cooking, that I planned with my cousins a couple of weeks ago. There are 27 years between the oldest and the youngest of her grandchildren, but to all of us these are her timeless dishes, dated only by the fact that we haven’t had them done quite right since she died. Granny’s cooking has assumed a kind of mythical status.Bennison, an Italophile, launched the site in 2014 and, fascinated by the status of pasta-making in Italy as a revered yet dying art, has since met and filmed more than 200 older women making the traditional dishes of Italy’s 20 regions. “The young can’t be bothered these days,” goes the narrative common among almost all those Bennison has featured, and it’s true that time-poor younger generations, valuing convenience, have come to rely on commercial dried pastas. Bennison has just visited Riposa, an 85-year-old in Puglia who, to avoid the heat of the day, had got up at 2am to make her orecchiette (pasta shaped like “little ears”). While the pasta rested on trays laid on her clothes dryer, she went for a siesta. “Those over 75 grew up having to make their own pasta,” says Bennison. “Dried pasta was for the middle classes. Now of course that’s changed, and fresh pasta is only for high days and holidays – dried is the cheap, go-to norm.” What’s happening in Italy is perhaps a slow-motion version of what has taken place in Britain since 19th-century industrialisation. When agrarian communities move to cities en masse, people begin to lose touch with the essence of where produce comes from, and what grows where and when. Add convenience foods, microwaves and plastic-clad vegetables for which soil is a distant memory, and cooking becomes less a question of technique than of unwrapping and reheating.Making food from scratch often seems to be a luxury. How paradoxical, given the roots of so much cooking lie in thrift. One-time methods of food preservation – fermenting, pickling, salting, curing – have become rustic trends requiring time, money and space, all for results that, though lovely, are hardly essential to feeding a family. Homemaking bread has gone from being a quotidian chore – quite literally, “daily bread” – to a rare thrill, a novelty even, mostly the preserve of a leisure class to whom the skill can be sold back at £150 a class.Of course, in Italy, Britain and beyond, there are groups of well-intentioned foodies doing their utmost to keep culinary traditions alive, from pasta-making to butter-patting and salvaging the lesser cuts of meat. But, says Bennison, “they’ll try and codify it, when actually there’s something quite anarchic about cooking, about doing your own thing”. There are some things that grannies can’t explain, and some knacks that can’t be put into recipes, “they just did what they could with the materials they had” – the governing principle influencing my own granny’s cooking, not least during rationing years, when restrictions on eggs, butter, sugar and flour ruled out pastry, cakes and other favourites. Cooking had to adapt change was dictated by necessity, not an Instagram feed.As befits a population that’s losing its culinary instinct, our cookbooks spoonfeed us with instructive minutiae. This was set in sharp relief only last week when we put together  Feast’s British classics special. A set of recipes lifted from Jane Grigson’s 1974 book, English Food, was covered in queries from editors, subs and food stylists alike. While we try to explain every step of a recipe to our readers, Grigson let hers fill in the (sometimes glaring) gaps: “make shortcrust pastry the normal way,” she wrote in her Cornish pasty recipe.But is it so mad to assume that people might know how to make shortcrust? Grigson saw it as so much of a given that her book is entirely without a recipe. Pastry is intrinsic to all manner of British classics, from steak-and-kidney or pork pie through to many a sweet treat, including gypsy tart (filled with muscovado sugar and evaporated milk) or curd tart (made with leftover curds from cheesemaking), both cited in the BBC website’s 2012 reader poll of forgotten foods. What about smoking bacon, boiling beef (perhaps with a cloth of pease pudding alongside), potting cheese or, embarrassingly, simply boiling an egg (apparently one in five Britons can’t)? We need a cookery skills equivalent to Slow Food UK’s Ark of Taste programme, “a catalogue of small-scale quality products threatened by industrial agriculture ... and homogenisation ... to protect our food heritage”. It would be as much a question of arming people with the confidence to trust their intuition as an exercise in raising awareness.Perhaps this all sounds like nostalgia for a world that doesn’t exist any more. Culinary change is inevitable and welcome. Modernity has opened many doors to our appetites – in a matter of minutes, I can be inspired by an Ethiopian meal someone’s eating in Addis Ababa, look up a recipe by a blogger in California, order the essential berbere spice mix to my front door, and have made that dish in my kitchen by the following day. But it’s also removed us from the idiosyncrasies of food that once defined people geographically – not to mention losing us some pretty useful life skills.• Mina Holland is deputy editor of Feast"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c345c2bf0a12daf6d859d64c0620f22f4c4af98f/0_21_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9930cfa4d4abee4296b2bcf177499495","title":"labour reversal brexit jeremy corbyn","story":"As a soft Brexit becomes ever more implausible, Jeremy Corbyn is going to feel the heat from young Labour pro-EuropeansThe referendum that propelled Britain towards exit from the European Union was called because David Cameron ran out of options for holding the Tories together. It would be a neat historical symmetry if the country voted on a reversal because Jeremy Corbyn faced the same problem with Labour.A referendum on Brexit terms is not Labour policy. In March, Owen Smith was sacked as shadow Northern Ireland secretary for saying it should be. But nuance has crept on to the frontbench since then. “We’ve not ruled anything out,” John McDonnell said in July. “But our preference is a general election.”That preference flows from three calculations. First, the collision between Theresa May’s Brexit deal and parliament this autumn will be so gruesome that the prime minister will fall. Second, that her departure will somehow propel Corbyn into Downing Street. Third, that the Brexit process will as a result be magically detoxified. All peril comes from Tory rule and ends when Labour’s crack team rides into the breach. Each of those judgments are debatable the last one is delusional.Corbyn fought the 2017 election on a pro-Brexit manifesto, yet his campaign scooped up millions of disoriented remainers. Opposition strategists concluded that the pro-European vote was a subset of anti-Tory feeling, which was – in England – owned by Labour. They worried more about pro-leave voters needing reassurance that Brexit would not be undone.A lot has happened since last June. The idea of a gentle separation from the continent has died. Brexiters are ided now only on the question of whether to minimise the pain or embrace it as a purgative procedure to fortify the nation’s soul. It is thus rational for anyone else to want annulment of the whole mismanaged enterprise on the menu. That option is especially popular among Labour members, whose pro-European ardour is stirred by every glimpse of Brexit’s ugly nationalist underbelly.Corbyn’s allergy to discussion of a Brexit reversal once looked tactically astute. Now it looks shifty. It compounds the impression of leadership unmoored. The row over antisemitism that has consumed Labour this summer is a mess of complex genesis on the far left, but the situation is made worse by general stagnation. The noxious miasma grows denser over a party that can’t seem to move forward on any front. It doesn’t even have anything useful to say on the biggest issue facing the country.This Euro-stasis is the expression of deadlocked forces that do not map on to pro- or anti-Corbyn faultlines. The alliance that wants to press on with Brexit unites the “old Labour” right, who fret about immigration control, with the “old Labour” left, which hates the EU’s legal framework for competition and free markets.The rival coalition is a fragile compound of unrepentant Blairites, who focus on the economic folly of quitting the single market, and the younger radicals in Momentum, who see Brexit opening a portal to an “alt-right” hellscape where Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg perform endless Donald Trump tributes.Pro-EU outriders in Momentum and anxious unions are nudging a referendum up Labour’s agenda. To help the lobbying effort, campaigners for the People’s Vote, the pro-plebiscite umbrella organisation, refrain from public criticism of Corbyn. No one anticipates a dramatic U-turn, but there is cautious optimism that the door to a policy shift, now barely ajar, will open a bit wider at this year’s annual conference.The obstacles are time and dogmatic tribalism at the very top. Corbyn’s closest allies don’t trust anyone who hasn’t always been around, alongside Jeremy on the long march through the wilderness. (The ledger of loyalty goes back to the 1970s.) They mistrust the People’s Vote campaign because it features MPs who have denounced the Labour leader – the likes of Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie. They don’t want to get behind anything that includes Tories, even pro-European dissidents such as Anna Soubry.Besides, many in Corbyn’s circle, including the leader himself, if his speeches are a reliable guide, are happy leaving the EU. The question is whether they would take Brexit at any cost. Perhaps the cost itself is the lure – the thrill of a cataclysm so vast that the Tories are disqualified from governing for a generation, revealing Corbynism as the only alternative. If so, there is more than accidental complicity between Labour and the Tory no-deal Brexiters. They share utopian arousal at the thought of revolutionary opportunities available in chaos.In truth, there is no single motive behind Labour’s European policy, only a mess of conflicting impulses and overlapping factional rivalries. The leadership is relaxed about Brexit in principle the membership hates what it means in practice. Meanwhile, the probability of any government getting a deal on terms superior to EU membership is zero. As the clock ticks down, Labour’s refusal to engage with the idea of reconsidering the whole thing, to say Brexit is a bad business, looks increasingly perverse and fanatical. Corbyn might not have the courage to call it one way or another. But he might soon see the advantage in daring to ask the question."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ccdc0b2370a6818fba310523eb24360fe8d2a00/0_0_1493_896/master/1493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94e64c6736bbc64a6e92cfd22698367","title":"vote now for your favourite space force logo","story":"Is this a propaganda master stroke, a legitimate safeguard against Chinese hegemony beyond Earth’s atmosphere or complete babbling nonsense?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26eae40db36550827e458650b225737d8a5b9a42/105_27_1211_727/master/1211.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9a5a17aeb6183a955d742c5b28a2fb","title":"five things manchester united jose mourinho","story":"José Mourinho can benefit from a director of football but club need a spirit of adventure to be Premier League contendersThe season’s first week proved bumpy for Manchester United. José Mourinho missed out on his desired centre-back. A message emerged that the club would not back the manager in the market on a carte blanche basis. He made Paul Pogba captain yet after a fine display against Leicester the midfielder said there would be a fine for saying certain things – again illuminating a difficult relationship with his manager.Yet with the 2-1 win on Friday Mourinho has negotiated half of the Leicester-Brighton double he identified as difficult owing to the many key players not available because of post-World Cup breaks. It offers a glimmer of optimism following Mourinho’s pre-season gloom. And given the hierarchy’s view that, while it will be tough, United should be title contenders, what has to be done to turn this hope to reality?Virtually everywhere Mourinho looks there are tensions he could do with easing. Chief here is the mutual disaffection between him and Pogba with the post-Leicester outburst possibly rooted in Mourinho’s lukewarm praise of his triumphant World Cup campaign. The Mourinho-Pogba contretemps are mirrored by those the former is enduring with Anthony Martial. The player wants to leave but, given the manager also missed out on a wide-forward in the window, pragmatism may mean differences should be buried. And while Mourinho and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, are cordial, the disconnect over transfers illustrates all is not perfect between the club’s two most important men. An upturn in these relationships is required.Given the scattergun recruitment since the supremely successful manager-chief executive axis of Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill ended six years ago, the decision to create an extra layer of football expertise is timely. Although Mourinho (or any incumbent) may wonder if authority over transfers will wane, a correct appointment should actually prove a boost. If both manager and director of football (DOF) are on the same page regarding identification of targets, then the case to be presented jointly to Woodward for him to sign off the finance should be bolstered. The plan is for the DOF to be in place once the restructuring of staff and expansion of the AON Training Complex for the women’s team is complete. It could, then, occur in time for the winter window and be of benefit if United remain in the championship race and Mourinho wishes to strengthen for a second-half-of-the-season push.United managed two victories from the five matches away from Old Trafford against the other top six sides. They drew 0-0 at Liverpool and lost 1-0 at Chelsea and 2-0 at Tottenham Hotspur but they beat Arsenal 3-1 and City 3-2. A yield of seven from 15 points while scoring only five times is not title-winning form though beating Pep Guardiola’s runaway victors proves the on-road record can be improved. United also suffered two surprise reverses on their travels, going down at Huddersfield Town (2-1) and Newcastle United (1-0) before the deflating reverse to West Brom at Old Trafford (1-0) that handed City the crown as early as 15 April.A prevailing reason for the executive’s belief that United can challenge is the impressive defensive record under Mourinho and the high margin for improvement in goals for. In 2016-17 United registered 54 goals but conceded only 29. Last year the count was 68 and 28. Compare this with the 85 of the champions, Chelsea, two seasons ago and the 106 of their successors, City, with United’s goals conceded second best each year. The hierarchy’s view is Mourinho should be able to coax more from a six-strong group who number Romelu Lukaku, Martial, Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford, Alexis Sánchez and Juan Mata. Lukaku well last year yet his 16 Premier League finishes were half as many as the Golden Boot winner, Mo Salah, and City had two men with more goals – Sergio Agüero (21) and Raheem Sterling (18). The Belgian needs support – no team-mate managed double figures – so the onus is on the other five each to register 10 or more times in the league. The onus, too, is on Mourinho to ensure they can achieve this. See final point …This has become the hoariest of chestnuts because it is so fundamental to United’s chances of challenging under Mourinho. Put simply he has to enable his creative players to express themselves, take more chances and swarm forward in more cut-throat style. There is difficulty recalling more than a handful of times this has happened under the manager and what is most baffling is how much better his team are when it does. The 3-2 derby win over City is a prime illustration of the frustrations many fans feel with Mourinho. United were 2-0 down at the interval and staring at allowing Guardiola’s side to become champions by beating them at the Etihad Stadium. Given zero choice, out came Mourinho’s men for the second half, Pogba scored twice quickly – on 53 and 55 minutes – before Chris Smalling’s late finish completed a memorable comeback win. This spirit of twist-or-bust has to be the template this year or United will not be contenders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03328f7c2a8232ca3e355192b1cfce2a3ef01c5b/177_57_3216_1929/master/3216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11404a17505369621a35b837b8607fda","title":"manchester united david de gea","story":"• The goalkeeper’s contract expires next summer • De Gea won the domestic Golden Glove last seasonManchester United are confident that David de Gea will sign a new deal, with the goalkeeper expected to receive a marked increase on his current salary of around £180,000 a week.The Spaniard is out of contract next summer, though United do have an option of another year. Yet given De Gea’s consistently superb form as one of the world’s best goalkeepers, and his importance to the side, there is a will from José Mourinho and the Old Trafford hierarchy to secure the 27-year-old’s services for the long term.The Spaniard came close to joining Real Madrid in the summer of 2015 when Louis van Gaal was in charge at United. Real, though, left their bid to the final day and an offer of £29.3m proved unsuccessful when the requisite paperwork was not filed in time.De Gea subsequently signed his current improved terms, though the threat of him leaving for the Bernabéu continued to linger.The European champions signed Thibaut Courtois on Thursday, which appears to have ended their pursuit of De Gea – for the moment at least. Yet, while it is understood this removes a potential complication regarding De Gea prolonging a United career that began in June 2011, there is a confidence he would have agreed the fresh deal even if Courtois had not joined Real.Since Sir Alex Ferguson brought De Gea to Old Trafford for £18.9m, a record at the time for a goalkeeper in English football, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League.The Spaniard claimed last season’s domestic Golden Glove and United’s Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year, the award voted for by fans.

A group of young men stub out cigarettes and pause conversation, squinting as they pull their shirts up over their mouths and noses. An elderly woman shuffles along the road towards me. She meets my eye then nods up to the haze above, a brown-grey cloud masking the normally Pacific-blue sky. This is Ambae, one of 83 islands comprising Vanuatu. The island is home to Monaro Voui, an active volcano that has sent plumes of thick smoke and ash into the air over the past 11 months, prompting a complete evacuation of the island last September. Residents returned a month later when the activity settled but the authorities have this month ordered another mandatory evacuation when monitoring revealed the chance of an eruption.The dust sneaks into fresh water supplies and covers gardens, reducing the quality and yield of food crops. It gathers on rooftops and changes the coastline appearance. Once rocky coastlines are now black sand beaches, an ominous symbol of the volcano’s power and energy.In April, villagers from high up on the volcano descended the mountain to sea-level evacuation centres inside church buildings and schools. Last month, the ash blocked out the sun completely, sending residents scrambling for torches in the middle of the day.The government’s evacuation notice means residents have to relocate within a week to nearby Maewo, providing incentives such as free transport, food contributions and health services. But many prefer to go to Santo, Vanuatu’s second-biggest island. Maewo is still at risk of ashfall, some tell me. Others admit Santo presents better opportunities for earning a living and the opportunity to be closer to family.I’m in Lonae, West Ambae where families are packing up their belongings for a second time in a year. As dawn breaks, small piles of boxes and belongings slowly appear on the beach and by 10am, a large crowd has gathered. This group has decided to go to Santo and word has it a ship funded by the Mormon church is due to arrive. The mood doesn’t feel exactly sombre. A young man plays guitar while children laugh and play on the sand. It’s clear the evacuation is considered a temporary measure for many.Eventually the ship arrives, anchoring two hundred metres offshore, and a small boat begins the cycle of trips back and forth. The disabled, sick and elderly board first. Women and children second. Finally, on perhaps the tenth trip, men board the boat. A dog swims furiously, chasing its owner, but eventually gives up and circles back to land.The scene is duplicated on East Ambae the following day, this time with a much larger ship headed to Maewo and officiated by a local policeman. I end up on the boat and this time the mood is tense. The evacuees cast their eyes back toward Ambae as we pull away from the island, uncertain what lies ahead and what will happen to the homes they have left behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/536df59b83154aa95aad751da2447c234fc28a2b/0_351_5340_3204/master/5340.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a7c54feef8f885c7bb4ca4379145f08","title":"outside lands politics san francisco","story":"Amid the tens of thousands of people who attended the 11th annual Outside Lands music festival in San Francisco’s Golden Gate park this weekend, one face stood out, two-dimensionally speaking: Barack Obama’s.The oversized cutout of the former president’s smiling face, taped to a long stick, bobbed above the crowd as fans cheered on the Scottish band Chvrches during their performance on Saturday.One of the four women from San Francisco who put together the prop described it as a “beacon of hope” during a weekend of fun amid deep isions and conflicts marking much of America’s public life.McMillan came mainly to see Janelle Monáe, NERD, the comedian Phoebe Robinson, and Janet Jackson, whose 1986 song Nasty made a comeback after Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton “such a nasty woman” during a president debate.Jackson’s headline set on Sunday began with a video collage of news images and headlines displaying many of todays ills: prejudice, inequality, shootings and more. The intro finished by asking if everyone got the social issue messages before letting them know it was time to dance. Then Burnitup! blared through the speakers and white lights swept across the stage. Jackson went on to perform many of her hits, including Nasty, What Have You Done for Me Lately, and Control.“It’s a nice get away from everything that’s going on,” said Patrice Wright, an Oakland resident in her 40s. “When I heard Janet Jackson was going to be here this year, I bought a ticket right away. It’s a great distraction.”“San Francisco and the Bay Area in general is always seen as this really open-minded liberal place, but a lot of the incidents that have gone mainstream recently have been out of the Bay Area,” Wright said referring to BBQ Becky, Permit Patty, Jogger Joe and the murder of Nia Wilson. “What’s kind of disappointing is just the reaction to it, where everyone is just like, ‘Well, it wouldn’t happen here’, or that it is just a one-time situation. It’s not.”Néo Modise, a 28-year-old Hayward resident came to the festival to enjoy a number of artists, including NERD. “Being here, you see a lot of ‘Fuck Trump’ shirts or things like that,” he said. But the band’s performance emphasized common ground, telling people in the crowd they were “brothers” and “sisters”, regardless of their racial background, Modise saidSimilar calls for unity came during Florence and the Machine’s set. Lead singer Florence Welch said she was saddened by “these days” and that “we all belong here”. And in a long, calm, middle passage of the hit song Dog Days Are Over, she asked audience members to embrace, express love for one another and “tell a stranger that you love them, because I promise you, on some cosmic level, you do”. She went even further, asking people to put away their phones. Upraised glowing rectangles of light winked out in response.Lauren Mayberry, the lead singer of Chvrches who has discussed issues ranging from #MeToo to gun control, veered away from heavy commentary. She told the crowd that she had been criticized for speaking about Trump because he was the leader of a country that wasn’t her own. She pointed out that she had the right to do so if he posed a broader threat to global stability, but left it at that. Gavin Newsom, California’s lieutenant governor who is running for governor in 2018, added another political element to the lineup with a discussion on Saturday that touched upon healthcare, college education costs, real estate prices, reproductive rights, Trump, and the cannabis industry.“It’s kind of sad what’s going on on the federal level,” said Angel Ortega, a 20-year-old student at the festival. “But with Gavin Newsom and other more liberal and progressive politicians making their way into politics, I personally have a more optimistic view of the future.

No-one was killed in Paris in 1991, so Corbyn may just have got the wrong date.On Saturday, the Daily Mail published pictures of Corbyn holding a wreath at the Palestinian Martyrs’ Cemetery in Tunisia.The paper said that its own visit to the cemetery had shown that the memorial for the victims of the 1985 bombing was 15 yards away from the spot where Corbyn was pictured holding a wreath.The story claims the pictures were taken in front of a plaque honouring the founder of the Black September and yards from the grave of Bseiso.Corbyn said that “a wreath was indeed laid” for “some of those who were killed in Paris in 1992” and added, in response to a question: “I was present at that wreath-laying, I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”He added: “I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere.Labour has said that Corbyn had already made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks indicate he was at least aware of another wreath-laying at the memorial event.Corbyn was speaking two days after the Daily Mail unearthed pictures of the Labour MP holding a wreath at the event, near the graves of four Palestinian leaders believed to be connected to Black September, which carried out the terror attack on Israelis at the 1972 Olympics, where 11 people died.Labour has previously said Corbyn had already made clear he was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli airstrike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. But Corbyn’s remarks, the first time he has spoken since the Mail story on Saturday, indicate that another wreath-laying took place at the memorial event.A few hours after Corbyn spoke, Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement via his official Twitter account criticising the Labour leader. “The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between,” the Israeli prime minister wrote.Labour said Netanyahu’s criticism was “false” and Corbyn responded by attacking the Israeli prime minister for presiding over the deaths of scores of people in Gaza. A party spokesman said: “Jeremy did not lay any wreath at the graves of those alleged to have been linked to the Black September organisation or the 1972 Munich killings. He of course condemns that terrible attack, as he does the 1985 bombing.”Shortly after, Corbyn, via his own Twitter feed, stepped up his response to Netanyahu. “What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children,” the Labour leader wrote.The controversial events took place at an event at the Palestinian martyrs’ cemetery in Tunisia, during a visit by Corbyn in 2014, a year before he became the party’s leader. There is a memorial to the victims of the 1985 bombing at the cemetery, although it is described as being 15 yards away from where Corbyn is pictured.A couple of metres behind where Corbyn and the group of people are standing are four graves of senior members of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. One of those belongs to Atef Bseiso, the PLO’s head of intelligence, who was assassinated outside a Paris hotel in 1992, and was allegedly killed by the Israeli secret service in revenge for the 1972 attack.Another is the grave of Salah Khalaf, also known as Abu Iyad, who was the second in command in the PLO at the time of his death and is the most senior Palestinian figure buried in the Tunisian cemetery. Khalaf, who is believed to have been a key figure behind Black September, was killed in Tunis in 1991, alongside two other figures who are also buried in the graveyard.Labour MP Luciana Berger said Corbyn needed to apologise. “Being ‘present’ is the same as being involved. When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. There can also never be a “fitting memorial” for terrorists. Where is the apology?” she said.Over the weekend, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, called on Corbyn to resign over the issue as the Conservatives sought to capitalise on the row.It is not the first time the event in Tunisia has been the subject of controversy. In the run-up to the 2017 election, Michael Fallon, then the defence secretary, said his presence there showed that Corbyn was “unfit” to be prime minister.Fallon’s accusation was based on an account given by Corbyn about the trip shortly afterwards in the Morning Star in October 2014. He wrote that: “Wreaths were laid to mark the 1985 bombing of the PLO HQ and on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991” – although he appears have made a mistake about the dates because the only person killed in Paris was Bseiso in 1992.The controversy emerges at a time when Labour is embroiled in a row about antisemitism and whether the party will adopt in full, with all its examples, the definition produced by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).Corbyn said in the same interview that the Labour party would consult with the Jewish and Palestinian communities over whether to adopt one remaining example attached to the IHRA definition.Striking a conciliatory tone, he said Labour had agreed to the IHRA definition and almost all of its 11 examples. “The one example that we are discussing and consulting on is one that makes sure that you can discuss and debate the relations between Israel and Palestine, the future of the peace process and, yes, make criticisms of the actions of the Israeli government in the bombing of Gaza and other places,” Corbyn said. “But you can never make those criticisms with antisemitic language or antisemitic intentions. And that is what we are absolutely clear on.”His remarks confirmed that Labour had dropped its objections to three other examples attached to the IHRA code. The remaining sticking point is the example that states “claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour” is antisemitic – because of concerns in the party about hindering legitimate criticism of the creation of Israel.Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, said that the only way “Jeremy Corbyn can put this issue to bed” is to “adopt the internationally agreed definition of antisemitism in full”. She added: “Until he does that, incidents such as his presence at the laying of wreaths at the graves of those responsible for torturing and murdering innocent Jewish Israeli athletes in Munich will continue to emerge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d8951839e0cacd90bb4109a0eff0b9f2662124/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4be9c79f80f9224d621cb6549e82e39","title":"more than munchies how eating pot went from crude to elevated dining","story":"Cannabis is becoming a cooking ingredient in its own right, as chefs create elaborate cannabis tasting menus at private dinners For most Americans, eating marijuana has long been about function over flavor. Think of the dish that inevitably comes to mind: pot brownies. Less a delicious dessert than a discreet delivery mechanism for THC (the drug’s primary psychoactive ingredient), brownies can be smuggled to places where cannabis isn’t welcome. Chocolate, meanwhile, does an adequate job of disguising the plant’s taste – which is reminiscent of dandelion leaves growing from cracks in the sidewalk.But with legalization and the attendant push to gentrify the drug, a small but vocal contingent have become champions of cannabis as a cooking ingredient in its own right. In cities where it’s legal, cannabis catering services now offer “elevated” dining experiences. On the new Netflix show Cooking on High, teams compete to make the most tempting ganja-infused dishes.Manny Mendoza, a young chef who has worked at some of Chicago’s best restaurants, said he learned at culinary school that he and his friends weren’t the only ones who liked to cook food and smoke weed. All over the world, “this is a part of us as cooks, as chefs”, he said.Mendoza began to think of cannabis as an “experiential seasoning” after being inspired by a music theory class. He compared the desired effect to synesthesia “a disorder, kind of” where people “start to taste colors or see sounds … A melding of the senses.”Even in legal states, restaurants can’t incorporate cannabis into their dishes since they’re not eligible for licenses. But the rules for private dinners are more open to interpretation. So Mendoza puts together elaborate cannabis tasting menus through his Herbal Notes project, based in Chicago and San Diego, California. The group throws dinners where cannabis, curated music and striking locations augment the food.Cannabis, like many other plants, gets its distinct aroma from chemicals known as terpenes, which can be flowery, spicy, earthy and a host of other flavors. To connoisseurs, the best weed is distinguished by the richness and complexity of its bouquet. And experienced cannabis chefs can often speak at great length about how they selected the cannabis sample for a particular dish.Easier access to weed is no doubt inspiring amateur chefs to whip up their own psychoactive specialties.Before getting started, it’s a good idea to do some research. Dosages can be hard to calculate, and eating too much pot can induce fear and paranoia which can last for hours.One place to begin is The Cannabis Kitchen Cookbook by Robyn Griggs Lawrence, the former editor of Natural Home magazine. Promising “feel-good food for home cooks”, the book collects recipes for mains, sides, desserts, juices salads and alcoholic cocktails from several noted chefs, and some background on the plants history as a food.Cannabis is a good source of protein and “has been part of the human diet since eating began”, Lawrence writes. “Technically, it’s a vegetable.”Since THC is fat soluble, cannabis infused dishes typically begin by infusing the plant into fatty ingredients like butter, oil and honey, which can then be deployed in curries, pasta sauces, cookies and so on. The book’s more intriguing recipes include hemp seed-crusted Chinook salmon with cannabis cream and a side of cinnamon-cannabis roasted sweet potatoes.Lawrence is also a proponent of juicing raw cannabis, which minimizes its psychoactivity and, she says, maximizes its nutritional value.It’s too early to know whether high end cannabis cuisine will become more than a novelty. Elaborate dinners of cannabis-infused food don’t always compliment the the capricious moods the plant can induce. And in less formal settings, cannabis infused food isn’t necessarily more than the sum of its parts.It’s an indication of the drug’s growing acceptance, however, that Lawrence’s book updates yesteryear’s good enough ganja brownies as a dessert worthy of an upscale restaurant: “Cannabis, chia, almond and goji berry ‘pot brownie’ with cranberry, chocolate and red wine sauce,” anyone?A recipe for cannabis, chia, almond and goji berry ‘pot brownies’ with cranberry, chocolate and red wine sauce. By Andie Leon. Reprinted with permission from the Cannabis Kitchen CookbookTo make this recipe you’ll need to start with a cannabis agave.Andie Leon is a fan of agave because it has a low glycemic index and won’t spike blood sugar the way refined sugar does. The sweetener, made from the blue agave plant (the same plant that’s used to make tequila) is preferable for Andie’s vegan catering clients because it doesn’t come from bees, but it’s high in fructose and could be problematic for people with weight problems, diabetes or heart disease. You can make this simple infusion with honey if you’re not an agave fan. To make her cold infusion, Andie simply pours a 12-ounce bottle of raw blue agave over an eighth of an ounce of finely ground cured cannabis flowers wrapped in cheesecloth and lets it sit in a cool, dark place (in a labeled jar, of course) for at least five days (the longer it sits, the more potent it will be). After she’s squeezed every last drop of agave out of the cheesecloth, Andie pours another bottle of agave over the cannabis bundle to extract whatever THC remains. The second batch is generally less potent than the first, so note that when labeling it for storage. Cannabis agave will keep in a cool, dark place for up to a month.18 ounce (3.5g) cured and trimmed cannabis flowers1 12-ounce bottle raw blue agave or raw honeyCoffee grinder or mortar and pestleCheeseclothAirtight glass jarUsing a coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle, grind and crush cannabis to a fine powder. Wrap cannabis in a cheesecloth and tie ends together to make a bundle (or tie with string). Place in a labeled airtight glass container with a tightly fitting lid. Pour agave over cheesecloth. Seal with lid, label, and let sit in a dark place for at least five days. Remove cannabis bundle and squeeze out every last drop of agave. Compost cannabis solids or use to make another batch. Store in a cool, dark place for up to one month. Andie Leon transforms gluten-free brownies made with two-thirds of a cup of cannabis butter, mesquite flour, coconut sugar, cacao nibs, chia seeds, coconut and goji berries into a full-on dessert when she smothers them in cranberry, chocolate, coconut, and red wine sauce made with a third of a cup of cannabis agave. Cacao nibs, “nature’s chocolate chips”, provide pure chocolate flavor from whole cacao beans as well as antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and fiber. Andie makes the brownies with a combination of wheat flour and gluten-free mesquite flour, which is made from ground dried pods of the mesquite tree and is rich in soluble fiber, calcium, and magnesium. You could substitute mesquite flour for all the flour in this recipe to make it gluten-free, or you could substitute wheat flour for the mesquite flour if you prefer. The brownies are strong on their own, so start with 1” x 1” pieces (people who know they have tolerance can have more than one) and temper the dosage by drizzling on more or less sauce. The chocolate in this dessert overwhelms the taste of cannabis butter, so the taste of the cultivar you use isn’t all that important.1 13 cups flour, sifted23 cup mesquite powder (or flour)23 cup cocoa powder1 tsp baking powder2 eggs2 tbsp vodka¼ cup raw almonds (or almond flakes)½ cup cacao nibs1 tsp cannabis-infused agave or honey (recipe on page 118)23 cup cannabis-infused butter, softened (here’s a good basic pot butter recipe)23 cup coconut sugar¼ cup black chia seeds½ cup grated coconut½ cup goji berriesPreheat oven to 350F (177C).

The cheapest 1,000 sq ft apartment at the back is being marketed for sale at £2m. At the top of the nine-storey block, a double-height five bedroom penthouse is offered for £30m. The developer Fenton Whelan was initially going to contribute just £1.3m to Westminster council’s affordable housing fund in lieu of including any affordable units in the luxurious development, which will include a residents’ spa, swimming pool and private restaurant offering 24-hour room delivery. Architect renderings of the development show a brown nine-storey block on the junction of Bayswater Road and Queensway. The pictures were widely distributed to the media by the developer Fenton Whelan, as well as being included in the planning application document published on Westminster city council’s website. Computer generated images of the nine-storey building, which local residents have dubbed the “bulbous blockhouse”, loom over a row of mews houses dating back to the 1870s which featured in the 1977 movie Valentino starring Rudolf Nureyev. The images show the building standing considerably higher than other buildings neighbouring it on Bayswater. The architect-created images show almost every apartment will feature a balcony overlooking the park, including wrap-around balconies on the three multimillion pound penthouses. The plans show renderings of a three-level basement, featuring a “pool, gym and personal fitness, steam, sauna, jacuzzi and treatment room”.Nicky Hessenberg, a local resident, said it was outrageous that no space in the development was being made available for key workers who are struggling to find anywhere to live in the borough. “Our beloved Bayswater is being gentrified and for no good reason,” she said. “Less and less space is available to anyone without very much money as gentrification spreads through the boroughs of central and suburbs of London, so as a result it becomes less and less erse – what a depressing thought. Our beloved London becomes a collection of sterile and deserted boroughs where only the rich can afford to be.”Some 3,950 households are currently on Westminster council’s affordable housing waiting list. The developer will pay a further £7.3m for “public realm improvements”. Fenton Whelan said £2.6m of this will go towards the building of new “Royal Gates” entrance to Kensington Gardens. “The new Royal Gates will be cast iron gates of exceptional quality and British craftsmanship, with Royal regalia and crown detailing, finished with gold gilding,” the developer said in marketing this week.Members of the public were not allowed to speak at the planning meeting. This restriction is not connected to the developer – the council is one of three in the country that does not allow the public to address planning committees. Westminster council said its new leader, Nickie Aiken, had launched “a major overhaul of the planning process to ensure it is transparent and seen to be transparent”. “A review of planning is under way at Westminster at the moment and further changes, including allowing the public the direct right of address at meetings, are proposed,” a council spokesman said. The controversial plans were referred to Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. He approved the scheme in July 2016 soon after he took office following a campaign centred on the urgent need to address London’s “housing crisis”. A spokesperson for the mayor said: “When Westminster council approved the scheme, the developer offered £8.5m towards affordable housing. It was referred to the mayor in July 2016, just weeks after Sadiq took office, at which point his new stronger policies on affordable housing had not yet been published.“Although the scheme had to be considered under the previous mayor’s London Plan policies, Sadiq’s team were able to negotiate with the developer and get their contribution increased to £11m.”Westminster councillor Paul Dimoldenberg, who speaks for Labour on business, said: “Sadly, as council we have a long history of taking the money rather than demanding that applicants follow the council’s own policies and provide affordable housing onsite. This happening all over the borough, from Soho to Bayswater. “Westminster is becoming a place that only the very rich can afford and that’s something that will undermine community life within the city. We fought a battle on this one, but we lost.”James Van Den Heule, who set up Fenton Whelan with fellow banker Sanjay Sharma, said he would have no hesitation in taking legal action against the  when a reporter asked him about the affordable housing provision in a prearranged interview. A spokesman for Van Den Heule said: “James does not want to co-operate or be quoted in any article … If you quote or misquote James in any manner in your article we will have no hesitation in considering taking legal action against both you personally and the .” He later added: “The Park Modern project will spearhead the regeneration of Queensway into Bayswater Village, a regeneration scheme which is championed by Westminster city council. The development will make a total public contribution of £18.3m which will be used to deliver £11m of affordable housing as well as a series of important public realm improvements.”The spokesman also pointed out: “Fenton Whelan has not made money on the project to date, the project will not realise profits until the private sale units are sold, so it would be a total misrepresentation to suggest to readers that the developer has already made vast sums of money on this project, whilst the local community has not. Again, the project will not make money for the developer until the sales campaign starts and units are actually sold. Without projects like this, and developers like Fenton Whelan, significant pieces of London would not benefit from regeneration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7548cf3b1973582bc283e97b95e203a432bd97/0_173_5200_3119/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b50040b73172f3db8e5c8829764cd004","title":"social housing green paper tenants to gain powers against rogue landlords","story":"Campaigners say green paper proposals fail to tackle urgent need for more affordable homesSocial housing residents will be empowered to take on rogue landlords under the government’s new strategy, but campaigners have criticised the document which offers no new funding.However, the paper will say no social housing tenant should feel a “stigma” about council renting and the department said it would “challenge the stereotypes that exists about residents and their communities.”Housing campaigners including Shelter and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said the reforms would not be effective without substantial new funding for council house building.The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, called the proposals “pitiful” and said they failed to tackle the crucial question of a lack of supply, as the number of new social rented homes built last year hit the lowest level since records began.“The number of new social rented homes is at a record low but there is no new money to increase supply and ministers are still preventing local authorities run by all parties from building the council homes their communities need,” he said.JRF’s chief executive Campbell Robb said: “The lack of concrete plans to build significantly more truly affordable homes risks failing a generation. Against a backdrop of rising food bank use, families on low incomes will continue to face impossible choices about whether to pay the rent or put food on the table.“We urge the government to invest in 80,000 genuinely affordable homes a year at the next spending review to put things right.”Shelter’s chief executive, Polly Neate, said the green paper was “full of warm words but doesn’t commit a single extra penny towards building the social homes needed by the 1.2 million people on the waiting list.”The Local Government Association said the reforms were “a small step, compared with the huge and immediate need for more genuinely affordable homes”.LGA’s housing spokeswoman Judith Blake said: “The government must go beyond the limited measures announced so far, scrap the housing borrowing cap, and enable all councils across the country to borrow to build once more. This would trigger the renaissance in council housebuilding which will help people to access genuinely affordable housing.”The green paper, launched by the communities secretary, James Brokenshire, on Tuesday, will introduce new performance indicators and league tables of housing providers, which the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said would “rebalance the landlordtenant relationship to hold bad practice to account”.The government has said it will give new teeth to the housing watchdog to ensure social homes are well-managed, moves inspired by the Grenfell Tower fire in west London.Ed Daffarn, a survivor of last year’s Grenfell Tower fire and member of the Grenfell United campaign group, cautiously welcomed some of the ideas but said residents were cautious about the effectiveness of league tables.“Social housing is not like choosing a doctor – you can’t just up sticks and move if your housing association gets a low rating,” he said. “Much more is needed to put power in residents’ hands. We need a new regulation system that will be proactive and fight for residents, with real repercussions for housing associations or councils that fail in their duty.”The green paper will drop plans to force the sale of council homes in areas with high-value properties, the  understands, a proposal from 2015 which had been fiercely opposed by councils.Blake said it would be a relief for councils. “We have worked hard to demonstrate the need to scrap this policy which would have forced councils to sell off large numbers of the homes desperately needed by low-income families in our communities,” she said.Under plans unveiled in 2015, local authorities were required to sell millions of pounds worth of council homes to fund discounts for the right-to-buy scheme for housing association tenants. Shelter had estimated it could force the sale of 23,500 council homes in England in just one year.Social housing regulation is still under review, as is right-to-buy where the government is consulting on reforming the rules governing the use of receipts from the sale of council housing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/184176dd35541d381c890891892508e668cf9e3c/71_246_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=409afa48163e5884580ffa9cb1b68b48","title":"ben stokes not recalled to england squad to face india third test","story":"Ben Stokes could yet be called into the England squad for the third Test against India at Trent Bridge this weekend as his trial for affray at Bristol crown court nears its conclusion.In naming an unchanged 13 from the innings victory at Lord’s on Sunday the England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed “an assessment” on Stokes’s availability will be made at the conclusion of the case, with the jury due to begin deliberations on Tuesday morning.As things stand, however, England will look to wrap up a series win against Virat Kohli’s beleaguered tourists at the earliest opportunity in Nottingham without their talisman. Chris Woakes stepped up admirably in the second Test with an unbeaten 137 and four wickets and thus the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, is unconcerned.In response to his side’s impressive start to the series with India, Bayliss highlighted the nine-wicket performance by his attack leader, Jimmy Anderson who, despite having recently turned 36, has now further extended his lead as the world’s No1‑ranked bowler.“As long as he keeps his body fit there’s no reason why he can’t go on for three or four years,” Bayliss said. “In these conditions he’s the best in the world. A lot of other bowlers do start to drop off mid-30s or so. It’s only the very, very best that are able to keep it going. I think he’s showing that he is the very, very best.”While tipping Anderson to keep going for some time yet – a chronic shoulder injury that he manages notwithstanding – Bayliss admitted he is constantly assessing who could be his long-term replacement, even if the Australian himself steps down at the end of next year.Woakes, 29, has long been mooted as a potential successor, given his ability to swing the ball at pace, but Bayliss, while stressing how pleased he was by the all-rounder’s recent success, not least since he remains one of the most diligent workers in the squad, admitted “the challenge for him is away from home, as it is for a lot of the boys”.Of Ollie Pope, who on debut made a well-crafted 28 with the bat, held two catches and effected a run-out, Bayliss said: “He looked a young guy with no worries about previous failures or successes, he was just out there playing cricket.”India, meanwhile, have confirmed they have no concerns over the fitness of Ravi Ashwin, who was struck on a hand while batting at Lord’s. Their main concern surrounds the captain, Kohli, who has insisted he will be ready to take the field at Trent Bridge despite being hampered by a back problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abe7059c2f899f5dbfbc2046dee4677326433344/114_133_3277_1966/master/3277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596cf195e86303985889419552655063","title":"dina asher smith european championships","story":"• Neil Black thinks there is more to come from the sprinter• Asher-Smith’s coach John Blackie credited with key roleDina Asher-Smith’s “out of this world” treble at the European Championships was the best display by a British track competitor in a generation, according to the UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black.Asher-Smith will go for 100m, 200m and 4x100m gold medals again at next year’s world championships and Black, who has worked in the sport for 26 years, said her rivals would be “crazy” to underestimate her.“We knew that Dina had loads of talent,” he said. “But what she’s done is incredible. It’s better than anything I’ve seen in my time at UK Athletics, really. She has been so focused, so determined, so professional and so calm. She is a pleasure to have around and has really demonstrated to everyone else in the team how to go about performing at the highest level.”Asher-Smith started by breaking her British 100m record, repeated the trick in the 200m, before topping off her week by taking the team from fourth to first in the 4x100m to clinch her third gold of the championships on Sunday night.Black believes she can go even faster. “There is more to come, and she knows that,” he added. “I honestly think this is the beginning. I think she is going to run even faster. And I am absolutely sure all her competitors across the world have finally registered what she can do. When you put Dina’s multiple gold medal-winning and world-leading, world-class times together, if they are not fearful, if they are not respectful, then they must be crazy.”Black attributed Asher-Smith’s victories to a combination of great genetics, hard work and determination, as well as the efforts of her coach, John Blackie. “They have worked together for years and she believes in him and vice versa,” Black said. “He knows how to get the best out of her. I remember a conversation a couple of years ago, and she said: ‘John knows how to get the best out of me.’“On the surface she is this lovely, butter-wouldn’t-melt person but underneath it she is ruthless when she needs to be. She works out with real clarity what needs to be done and I don’t think she lets anything get in the way.”As bookmakers cut Asher-Smith’s odds to win the BBC sports personality of the year from 50-1 to 9-1, behind Harry Kane, Geraint Thomas and Anthony Joshua, she was also lauded as a “key player” in the sport going into the Tokyo 2020 Olympics by the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe.“The great thing about Dina is that she just clearly loves big championship racing,” Coe said. “But she’s also got a real hinterland. I talked to her a few years ago and we were chatting about the fact she was doing a history degree and that her dissertation was on the impact jazz has had on social integration. It shows there are other things in her world and that will stand her in good stead when the pressure’s really on.”Toni Minichiello, who brilliantly guided Jess Ennis-Hill to Olympic gold at London 2012, said it is important Asher-Smith does not try to change too much as she gears up for Tokyo. “She has run phenomenal times and is well capable of becoming a world star,” he said. “She just has to not overcook it. Sometimes when you step up to an even higher level you think you have to train more and do things differently. But you have just got to add a little bit at a time and let mother nature do its thing.“Dina is only 22 so she doesn’t need to go crazy with the training, or the commercial offers and publicity she is going to get. I know after 2009 when Seb Coe labelled Jess as the face of London 2012 we were unprepared for things that flooded in. Dina will have to be selective so she can spend the time training and not be distracted, but she’s smart enough to know that.”Black praised the rest of the British team, who arrived back from Berlin on Monday with 18 medals, including seven golds, and said they were ready to take on the world. In particular he praised the heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who recovered from a calf injury to take silver in a new personal best.“Everybody has had doubts. She has had doubts,” he said, “but Kat has matured and her confidence and decision-making have made her a much better competitor.”There were also warm words for Zharnel Hughes and Matt Hudson-Smith, who won the 100m and 400m, as well as Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake and Adam Gemili, who were key members of the men’s 4x100m team.“I have no doubt we have a strong crop of genuine potential global medallists and we have seen some of them in Berlin,” Black added. “I just think very positive thoughts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0abdd70cf24b88e82348d3df1c3793944bcc53e1/167_171_5601_3360/master/5601.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d659dc5e448ad965316b14c9f3c630b4","title":"donald campbell jg parry thomas john cobb malcolm campbell adventurers","story":"The sight of Donald Campbell’s speedboat Bluebird K7 powering along the surface of Loch Fad off the Isle of Bute last week – albeit at a mere 150mph, or half of the speed at which it was designed to travel – evoked a time when those who broke speed records could claim a degree of fame matching that of a world heavyweight boxing champion. Henry Segrave, George Eyston, JG Parry Thomas, John Cobb and Malcolm Campbell, Donald’s father, were household names in the middle of the last century, fulfilling a mission not only to compete against each other but to prove the supremacy of British technology. And, quite often, to die as a result.The risk involved in attempting such feats on land and water was part of the appeal to the public imagination. It belonged to a culture that embraced adventurers who competed with each other to plant flags on the North and South Poles, to fly over the Himalayas or to stand on the summit of Everest.Parry Thomas, a Welsh car designer, was the first man to die in pursuit of the land speed record when his giant aero-engined car turned over while travelling at more than 100mph on Pendine Sands in Carmarthenshire in 1927. The driver was laid to rest in a churchyard near Brooklands, where he had won many races, while the car was buried in the Pendine dunes, from which it was disinterred several decades later.In the same month as Parry Thomas’s accident Segrave captured the land speed record. When he was killed on Windermere three years later, when his boat Miss England\u0026nbspII capsized while he was trying to break the 100mph mark on water, the manner of his death seemed heroic. It was a natural fit with a résumé that included wounds suffered as a fighter pilot on the western front, a victory in his Sunbeam in the 1923 French Grand Prix (the first for a British car and driver), becoming the first man to travel on land at 200mph at Daytona Beach in 1927 and engaging in a fierce and prolonged patriotic battle against an American rival for the record on water. He had been knighted only a few months before his fatal run.Cobb, too, died on water, on Loch Ness in 1952, when his jet-powered boat Crusader broke up while he was trying to exceed 200mph. At the time he was the holder of the land speed record, set at 394mph on Bonneville Salt Flats in his teardrop-shaped Railton Special, powered by twin aeroplane engines.His machines, like Segrave’s Miss England II and Eyston’s Thunderbolt, were things of beauty, shaped not by the unsentimental logic of the computer but by the human eye engaged in the task of creating an object capable of moving as smoothly as possible through air or water. The designer’s instinct was to believe that, if the result looked good, then it would probably work.Attitudes to risk and speed have changed as much as the understanding of aerodynamics. But still, somewhere in the (generally English-speaking) world, someone or other is usually working on a scheme to obliterate marks that are now fast receding into history. To do so in 2018 they would have to beat the land record of 760mph set by the RAF fighter pilot Andy Green in the jet-powered Thrust SSC at Black Rock Desert in Nevada in 1997, or the record for boats notched up by Ken Warby of Australia, who travelled at 317mph on a New South Wales reservoir in 1978. But what would be the point?For the pioneers the ambition was obvious. Record-breaking drove development and benefited sponsors. The first land speed records were set in the 1890s by French-built electric cars. When the internal combustion engine offered greater performance, the newer technology took over. More speed translated easily to the market, although those aims were becoming blurred by the time Donald Campbell walked into the spotlight in the 1950s. Passenger cars and boats had long since exceeded the sort of maximum speeds any normal person would sensibly require.But Donald Campbell was competing against more than records and rivals. He was competing against the memory of his dead father. Sir Malcolm Campbell had fought at the Battle of Mons, won grands prix in Bugattis and, at Bonneville in 1935, became the first person to drive at 300mph. Despite his public support for Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists – the Blackshirts – in the 1930s, he spent the second world war in charge of the plans to evacuate King George VI and his family in the event of a German invasion. He died in his bed in 1948, aged 63.He was demanding and even ruthless, and his son could not escape his shadow. “He was the most important single influence on my life,” Donald Campbell told the writer John Pearson in 1964, during a fraught trip to Australia, during which he eventually topped 400mph to set a land speed record. “You could come up with some very fancy Freudian theories to explain what I’m up to here.” Three years later he was killed when his boat reared up on Coniston Water and crashed on its back at around 300mph.In 2000, when ers located the broken K7, with his body still in the cockpit, his family was ided. Some, including his widow, thought the retrieval project was a bad idea. His daughter, who had made record attempts of her own, was all for it. For the rest of us the reappearance of that distinctive humpback hydroplane provides a reminder of a time when heroism was seldom questioned and progress in technology was assumed to be benign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b981dca4c332990fa48622071698db3682b1e13f/0_373_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73592222e2ceda1d616f14024a4d3734","title":"tiaras grimaces and splashes the best pictures from the european championships 2018","story":"As we bid farewell to the first multi-sport European Championships, it wasn’t just the athletes and competitors showcasing their talents in Glasgow and Berlin, the sports photographers present also used the event to demonstrate their own skills and technique"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1530ff3c67078b6c495bdf72b140baf850be3b57/0_92_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024eaa79085adcf042e51c85974b601d","title":"julie hesmondhalgh interview edinburgh fringe the greatest play in the history of the world","story":"Julie Hesmondhalgh, 48, was born in Accrington, Lancashire.

She lives in Manchester, and is currently starring in The Greatest Play in the History of the World at the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, for which she won the first of The Stage’s Edinburgh awards last week.Tell us a bit about your Edinburgh festival show…A couple of years ago I said to my husband, Ian Kershaw, who is a writer, write me a one-woman show that we can tour for the rest of our lives. It’ll be romantic: in our 70s we can go and do it at festivals. So obediently, he kept disappearing over Christmas, and came back with this beautiful little gem of a play about love and loss and space and time.Reviewers have commented on what a lovely time you seem to have performing it. Are you?I’m terrified still! But you’ve got to fake it till you make it.Did you have any squabbles with your husband in the rehearsal room?No, he’s great. I did try my hand at rewriting swathes of it – and always ended up going back to what he’d written in the first place. I was just throwing my weight around really and, bless him, he let me.Is this your first time performing at the fringe?It is. I’ve seen 18 shows in the first week! I love it – it’s my happy place. You’ve got to make sure you don’t make yourself ill with running around, but it’s right up my street.Have you been given any advice for how to “survive” the month?It’s basically been just take your vitamins – which I have been doing, religiously – and have one day a week where you don’t see anything. I haven’t managed that yet…Do you have any tips for what to see?What Girls Are Made of, the Cora Bissett show. I found it one of the most incredibly moving and beautiful pieces that I’ve ever seen, let alone from this festival. It’s her story of losing her dad, and her brief flirtation with fame in the Britpop era.You’re a staunch Labour supporter. When did that start?Oh, always: I’m from a small northern industrial town and I lived through the Thatcher years. I’m a socialist, and it’s the engine that fires me, really – just hoping for a better, more equal society. These are such strange times we’re living in, you can see how quickly things can change for example, the #MeToo movement, which just shifted everything on its axis. Surely we’re at the tipping point now for austerity.Do you think people are reclaiming the term “socialist” after generations of it being a bit of a dirty word?Yeah, I do actually, in the same way that “feminist” has been reclaimed. I have teenage daughters and they give me such hope: their outlook on the world is so much more inclusive and accepting than even a generation ago. We’ve got a new generation who are proud to be socialist, and that’s really exciting.How do you feel Labour is performing?Everyone knows we’re in difficult times. But I’ve shared a platform with Jeremy Corbyn for many years and I know him to be a man of deeply held principles. The current problems in the party need to be sorted out, but if we carry on fighting within the left, the Tories are going to get in again. And it’s not just a matter of dinner party conversation – people are losing their lives. Disabled people are dying at an astonishing rate, the NHS is on its knees…Do you think it’s your duty as someone with a public profile to campaign politically?I think it’s my duty as a citizen it’s nothing to do with being a famous person. If you dare to go on a demonstration or raise your voice in solidarity with people that have less than you, people say: “Oh luvvies, what’s it got to do with you?” I’m not there as a luvvie – I’m there as a person who lives in this country, and wants to pay more tax! I’ve nothing to gain from it.You made history playing Hayley in Coronation Street at a time when trans narratives were very rare. Do you feel proud of it?I’m amazingly proud of it. It started a conversation, because soaps often do. Corrie put a love story at the heart of it – and that’s how you change the world. You’re hosting a charity sing-a-long screening of Mamma Mia in September. What’s your favourite Abba tune?Dancing Queen – obviously!

Three years after the remarkable I Loved Her, which chronicled the couple’s Catastrophe-style hook-up, Cave is back to prove it was no one-off. Sunrise is just as potent, a grownup and emotionally intelligent hour of heart-on-sleeve comedy. It’s a marvel that the show, so unflinchingly focused on her emotional life, does not feel self-indulgent. That’s because Cave presents it without a shred of self-pity: she’s matter-of-fact even when being devastatingly honest about her tortured feelings. It’s also a tribute to her writing skill. Sunrise pitches us right into Cave’s life, and her head. Much of it is narrated in the present tense there’s minimal retrospective reflection. And so we trace her journey from loser in love, obsessively Googling her lover’s new partners, to tentative steps toward new romance, forever counting the hours she can spend away from her kids, scheduling sex with frantic efficiency. It’s an advantage that she has got such a particular story to tell. Who else in standup is addressing a single mum’s unresolved affection for the now-absent father of her children? Again and again, Cave fashions a perspective you haven’t encountered before, or heard so effectively expressed – like the lovely fisherman-at-sea analogy for her yearning for Brown, or her arguments with him about the seriousness of his new relationship. (“Six dates is a gateway to a girlfriend!”) It’s wickedly funny, too, as Cave mocks her attempts to show Brown – and herself – that she can also be a good-time girl, or when, with her new beau, she visits a Harry Potter convention and turns it into a sex party. It’s all brought to life – a twisted indie romcom in standup form – with little more than some talking-head pillows, and Cave’s faith in the funny side of her obsessive personality and raw-nerve emotional life. That faith is fully justified."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5dbcd6d43321bcbe1fb4fc7eb1b8d3e9820098/0_103_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b8e7fb07d0a1bb3eb1c2d6c0b86c4ff","title":"google location tracking android iphone mobile","story":"Some services on Android and iPhone automatically stores your movements even after you pause the ‘location history’ settingGoogle wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.An Associated Press investigation found that many Google services on Android devices and iPhones store your location data even if you\u0027ve used a privacy setting that says it will prevent Google from doing so.Computer science researchers at Princeton confirmed these findings at the AP\u0027s request.For the most part, Google is upfront about asking permission to use your location information. An app like Google Maps will remind you to allow access to location if you use it for navigating. If you agree to let it record your location over time, Google Maps will display that history for you in a “timeline” that maps out your daily movements.Storing your minute-by-minute travels carries privacy risks and has been used by police to determine the location of suspects. So the company will let you “pause” a setting called “location history”.Google says that will prevent the company from remembering where you\u0027ve been. Google\u0027s support page on the subject states: “You can turn off Location History at any time. With Location History off, the places you go are no longer stored.”That isn\u0027t true. Even with “location history” paused, some Google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking.For example, Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its Maps app. Automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are. And some searches that have nothing to do with location, such as “chocolate chip cookies” or “kids science kits”, pinpoint your precise latitude and longitude accurate to the square foot and save it to your Google account.The privacy issue affects about 2 billion users of devices that run Google\u0027s Android operating software and hundreds of millions of worldwide iPhone users who rely on Google for maps or search.Storing location data in violation of a user\u0027s preferences was wrong, said Jonathan Mayer, a Princeton computer scientist and former chief technologist for the Federal Communications Commission\u0027s enforcement bureau. A researcher from Mayer\u0027s lab confirmed the AP\u0027s findings on multiple Android devices the AP conducted its own tests on several iPhones that found the same behavior.“If you\u0027re going to allow users to turn off something called ‘location history’, then all the places where you maintain location history should be turned off, Mayer said. “That seems like a pretty straightforward position to have.”Google says it is being perfectly clear.“There are a number of different ways that Google may use location to improve people\u0027s experience, including: Location History, Web and App Activity, and through device-level Location Services,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to the AP. “We provide clear descriptions of these tools, and robust controls so people can turn them on or off, and delete their histories at any time.”To stop Google from saving these location markers, the company says, users can turn off another setting, one that does not specifically reference location information. Called “web and app activity” and enabled by default, that setting stores a variety of information from Google apps and websites to your Google account.When paused, it will prevent activity on any device from being saved to your account. But leaving “web and app activity” on and turning “location history” off only prevents Google from adding your movements to the “timeline”, its visualization of your daily travels. It does not stop Google\u0027s collection of other location markers.You can delete these location markers by hand, but it\u0027s a painstaking process since you have to select them inidually, unless you want to delete all of your stored activity.You can see the stored location markers on a page in your Google account at myactivity.google, although they are typically scattered under several different headers, many of which are unrelated to location.Huge tech companies are under increasing scrutiny over their data practices, following a series of privacy scandals at Facebook and new data-privacy rules recently adopted by the European Union. Last year, the business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby cellphone towers even if all location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data anyway.Critics say Google\u0027s insistence on tracking its users\u0027 locations stems from its drive to boost advertising revenue.Google offers a more accurate description of how “location history” actually works in a place you would only see if you turn it off: a popup that appears when you “pause” Location History on your Google account webpage. There, the company notes that some location data may be saved as part of your activity on other Google services, like Search and Maps”.Google offers additional information in a popup that appears if you reactivate the “web and app activity” setting – an uncommon action for many users, since this setting is on by default. That popup states that, when active, the setting “saves the things you do on Google sites, apps, and services … and associated information, like location”.Since 2014, Google has let advertisers track the effectiveness of online ads at driving foot traffic, a feature that Google has said relies on user location histories.The company is pushing further into such location-aware tracking to drive ad revenue. At a Google Marketing Live summit in July, Google executives unveiled a new tool that uses ads to boost in-person store visits. It says it can measure how well a campaign drove foot traffic with data pulled from Google users\u0027 location histories.Google also says location records stored in My Activity are used to target ads. Ad buyers can target ads to specific locations, say, a mile radius around a particular landmark and typically have to pay more to reach this narrower audience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c1b0608bcbd70e0c736fb3c8ca37ff95ac5583/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c98476870b7df22662a02ba829fa08 660w","title":"mark gatiss john minton lost man art tv review","story":"Minton was once more famous than Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. Now his superfan is on a mission to resurrect his reputation in this fascinating BBC Four documentaryMark was a teenager when he first saw Johnny across a room. He was immediately struck by him, mesmerised even, by Johnny’s long face, his wide eyes, their look of melancholy. It was the start of an obsession that has continued throughout Mark’s life.Mark is Mark Gatiss – actor, writer, Whovian, Holmesian, Renaissance polymath. Johnny is the painter John Minton. Who? Well, that’s kind of the point. At one time, Minton was more famous than his contemporaries Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud – now he is largely forgotten. Gatiss wants the world to unforget, to show how Minton is still important and to celebrate his work. “It’s time to invite Johnny back to the party that he left all too soon,” he says.Minton killed himself in 1957, aged 39. The room Mark first saw him across was in the National Portrait Gallery he was looking at – and falling for – Johnny’s self-portrait. He follows in Minton’s footsteps and stalks him to Soho, where Gatiss too gravitated on coming to London, “naturally – or unnaturally, because of its reputation for decadence, naughtiness”. They would probably have known each other if Gatiss had arrived in Soho half a century earlier.He meets some of the people who knew Minton, people who were part of the same bohemian scene – artists, students, muses and sitters. They include Bridget Riley and Peter Blake, and a former bodybuilder named Spencer Churchill, who turns out to be the subject of the Minton sketch that Gatiss owns. I suppose that’s one good thing about Minton being largely forgotten: you don’t have to be an oligarch or an oil sheikh to get your hands on one.Gatiss drifts down to what were London’s docks, where – in the blitzed wartime wasteland – Minton found romanticism. He pursues him to Cornwall, where Minton escaped from the heady excess of the capital to find new colour. Also to Corsica, although sadly not to Jamaica (a BBC Four budget doesn’t stretch that far, apparently.) And he examines the illustrations that made Minton so sought-after and celebrated, such as the ones on Elizabeth David’s cookbooks. I remember one my mum had: French Country Cooking, I think. Maybe you too knew Minton, without knowing that you did.But as much as it is about celebrating the work and looking at the pictures, it is about the man behind them. Gatiss plunges headlong into his hero’s world. In Minton’s Notting Hill studio, he imagines how it might have been – Dylan Thomas passed out in an armchair, Freud sneaking in with a pretty model, Johnny himself dancing a highland jig over a pair of crossed umbrellas.Listening to a recording of Minton – crackly and clipped – is, for Gatiss, like “reaching back into the past and holding his hand”. Which, given a Tardis, is surely what he would do. In Corsica, there pretty much is a Tardis. Or at least a monochrome bus, which Gatiss is suddenly riding through the hills in 1947. Every time it stops, he hops off with his sketchbook, as Minton did, to capture a view (is there no end to this man’s talents?). He has actually become Minton.In his haunting, waif-like self-portraits, Gatiss detects something else going on, “a familiar longing, a sort of ache”. In a deeply repressive age, Minton’s sexual awakening came about in the wartime blackout with sailors down by the docks. He became an early champion of gay rights, splendidly taking on Marie Stopes on the letters page of the Listener in 1950, 17 years before the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in England and Wales.Gatiss speaks so well about Minton’s work, his struggles between modernism and conservatism, the commercial and the artistic, and how he eventually fell out of favour. Gatiss speaks not as an art historian but as an informed superfan, one who truly gets him.

He shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria.His clothes were torn from him and the braid was cut off and taken to the UK, along with hundreds of objects pillaged by an expeditionary force under the command of Lt Gen Sir Robert Napier.It was a military expedition to save British hostages, including the British consul, Charles Cameron, who had been kept in chains for more than two years.The army destroyed the emperor’s Maqdala mountain fortress in northern Ethiopia. It brought back treasures, transported on 15 elephants and 200 mules, that were eventually deposited in various British institutions.For years, the braid has been held at the National Army Museum in Chelsea. It was removed from view following a visit in April by the Ethiopian ambassador, who made an official call for its return. Ethiopia wants the braid to be interred with the rest of the emperor’s remains at his final resting place at the monastery of the Holy Trinity at Quara.Sources said the museum discussed the request at its May council meeting and that the director was asked to write a report recommending possible outcomes, which were to be communicated to the Ethiopian embassy before 1 September.The museum declined to comment on Monday. The Ethiopian embassy in London confirmed that a restitution request has been made.Ethiopia has long called for Britain to return the looted artefacts. In April, the Victoria and Albert Museum announced that a gold crown was among treasures that could be returned on long-term loan.Its director, Tristram Hunt, noted that even in the 19th century this episode of British and Ethiopian history “was regarded as a shameful one”. He acknowledged the “objects’ difficult past and their rich Ethiopian cultural heritage”.The Ethiopian government is calling on the British Museum and other UK custodians of treasures seized at Maqdala to follow the V\u0026ampA’s example. Part of the problem is that institutions like the British Museum do not have legal powers to deaccession.In 2010, Westminster Abbey was criticised by campaigners over its refusal to return a looted tabot to the Ethiopian Orthodox church. Tabots – small tablets that symbolise the Ark of the Covenant – are regarded by 35 million Ethiopian Christians as so sacred that only priests are allowed to look at them. The abbey has a stone tabot inlaid at the back of an 1870s altar in the Henry VII Lady Chapel, where it is visible to anyone peering around its left side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55173c3bf154936c67f9b7d2ccfdc3c14f6da8c4/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6e3c7174359189f529933938dc51887","title":"urinoir furore paris residents peeved at public eco friendly urinals","story":"Île Saint-Louis residents demand removal of bright-red receptacles with no stallA set of eco-friendly but completely exposed urinals that have been introduced to the streets of Paris are provoking uproar among residents. One of the bright-red “urinoirs” installed on the Île Saint-Louis, not far from Notre Dame Cathedral and overlooking tourist boats passing on the Seine, has caused particular indignation. Residents and businesses have written to the town hall to demand its removal and are planning a petition. “There’s no need to put something so immodest and ugly in such an historic spot,” said Paola Pellizzari, 68, owner of a Venetian art store. “It’s beside the most beautiful townhouse on the island, the Hôtel de Lauzun, where Baudelaire lived,” she said, referring to the 19th-century French poet. She feared the urinal, installed about 20 metres from a primary school, “incites exhibitionism”. The designer of the “Uritrottoir” – a combination of the French words for urinal and pavement – said it offered an “eco solution to public peeing”. The device is essentially a box with an opening in the front and a floral display on top containing straw which transforms into compost for use in parks and gardens. But residents and businesses of Île Saint-Louis said the receptacle, with no stall around it of any kind, could blight the neighbourhood. “It’s horrible,” said the 50-year-old owner of a nearby art gallery, who declined to give his name. “We’re told we have to accept this but this is absolutely unacceptable. It’s destroying the legacy of the island. Can’t people behave?“ Ariel Weil, the local mayor, said the devices were necessary. Paris authorities have rolled out four of theurinals in spots where public peeing has been a problem, and a fifth is planned. “If we don’t do anything, then men are just going to pee in the streets,” Weil said. “If it is really bothering people, we will find another location.” Some have described the urinals as discriminatory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d73968c596b503fa8997c8c8bb7b7ee9edff0b/0_265_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c7971809800959c05e488456b85e3cf","title":"what god has not joined together the rise of the humanist wedding","story":"Secular marriages are now the most popular in Scotland, prompting fresh calls for reform in England and WalesRobyn Hewatt and Andrew Downie were married with all the trappings of a traditional Scottish wedding: Hewatt’s father walked her down the aisle she had maids of honour and Downie had a best man. A piper played at the door.But there was no priest, minister or registrar to lead the ceremony. Like thousands of Scots, Hewatt and Downie were legally married by a humanist celebrant. For the first time last year, in what was once a famously religious country, the Humanist Society of Scotland married more people than the Church of Scotland.Hewatt, 29, a gym instructor, and Downie, 34, a manager with the Screwfix chain, said their wedding on Saturday fitted their identity. “We felt we could make it more personal to us and our story. A humanist ceremony spoke more to us than a more traditional religious type of ceremony,” Downie said.The catalyst for this dramatic shift came in 2005 when the then registrar general of Scotland changed the law on human rights grounds to allow humanist celebrants to conduct weddings. Scotland categorises humanist weddings as a non-religious belief ceremony, with the same legal status as church-based and civil marriages. Humanists include atheists and agnostics, and those who say they are spiritual but who dislike organised religion. They embrace same-sex marriage, too, unlike most mainstream churches.And since 2005 they have mushroomed: in 2017, there were 5,912 humanist weddings with 3,283 conducted by Humanist Society celebrants compared with just 3,166 by the Church of Scotland. With couples barred from legally marrying with a humanist wedding in England and Wales, some now travel to Scotland to be married, and at least four humanist celebrants from England are hoping for approval to carry out legal marriages in Scotland.Hewatt and Downie were married by Caroline Lambie, 47, who was brought up in the Scottish Episcopalian church, a branch of Anglicanism, before deciding at an early age she was agnostic. Lambie was herself married at a humanist wedding in 2007.“Being secular makes sense for most couples I work with,” she said. “These couples say to me that they would feel hypocritical if they did have a church wedding as they have no religious beliefs.”Prof Callum Brown, a historian at the University of Glasgow and an expert in secularism, believes the country has the highest rate globally of humanist weddings. “Scotland is leading the world in non-religious belief weddings,” Brown said. “I know of no other country where it is anywhere near so high.”This summer humanist weddings were legally recognised for the first time in Jersey and in Northern Ireland – a place still dominated by religious faith, heaping further pressure on ministers in London to finally authorise humanist weddings in England and Wales.Humanists UK, the body which covers England and Wales, is planning to take the UK government to court on human rights grounds in an effort to force reform. Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, said: “The continual failure to recognise humanist marriages in England and Wales not only makes these jurisdictions seem antiquated compared to the rest of the country, but fails to uphold the principle of equality embedded in our human rights settlement.”Brown said the decline in religious weddings and church attendance generally could be seen across Europe and the industrialised west, especially among whites. It was fuelled first by the advancement of women’s rights in the 1960s, which increased women’s education and economic independence.More couples chose to cohabit, never marrying or doing so later in life, he said. Progressively fewer people attend church and fewer still have their children baptised. He added Scotland had a long tradition of Sunday opening for shops, something liberalised in England and Wales only relatively recently.Brown saidthe rate of decline in religious involvement in Scotland had been far faster and more pronounced than in other parts of the UK. It had experienced “a dramatic change from the closed-mind Presbyterianism” which once dominated Scottish life, he said.Churches are privately critical of the humanist trend, suggesting it is a pick-and-mix form of consumerism, sometimes using Christian iconography such as crosses even though humanist events are intended to be secular.Yet Rev Dr George Whyte, the principal clerk at the Church of Scotland, said his church had failed to market its increasingly liberal approach to weddings. The Church of England, by contrast, has a slick and cheery website devoted to selling its religious marriages: yourchurchwedding.org.Whyte pointed out that couples no longer needed to be members of the church vows could be personalised and marriages conducted outside the church. There are no longer rules stipulating brides needed to enter first or be given away by their father."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3594480.1534139670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin industrial estates could be rezoned for homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin city’s industrial estates could be replaced by thousands of homes under large-scale rezoning plans. File photograph: Alan BetsonDublin city’s industrial estates could be replaced by thousands of homes under large-scale mass rezoning plans from Dublin City Council to tackle the capital’s housing crisis.The council’s head of housing, deputy chief executive Brendan Kenny, said the city would “run out” of residentially zoned development land in four years and must turn its attention to industrial estates as a source of new housing land.The sites would be suitable for high-density apartment development, Mr Kenny said, and could accommodate some high-rise buildings, taking advantage of the Government’s removal of caps on height.The Department of Housing last week published draft guidelines to encourage local authorities to allow taller apartment blocks in city centres and close to good transport links. The target industrial lands are all beside established residential areas, with some already served by Luas and rail lines.The rezoning of the hundreds of acres could result in a windfall for land owners whose sites are no longer commercially viable, but who have been unwilling to sell up because of the lower property values attached to industrially zoned lands.Previously, old industrial or “brownfield” sites have been zoned on a case-by-case basis, but city councillors will, in the coming months, be asked to consider mass rezoning of large portions of – or sometimes entire – industrial estates.“A lot of this land is totally underutilised,” Mr Kenny said. “In some places, for a large number of years there has been little or no activity on them.”The council will initially focus on the city’s older industrial estates which were once at the city’s outer reaches and have over the years become “sandwiched” between residential areas, such as the Dublin Industrial Estate in Glasnevin, the Kylemore Industrial Estate, west of Inchicore, and industrial lands around Coolock to the northeast of the city.While these lands are in private ownership, the council hopes the change in zoning would “encourage” owners to either sell, or form development partnerships for the land.“These industrial estates are ripe for development, but are owned by many people. We would like to see landowners coming together with masterplans on how their sites might be redeveloped.”Even if land was rezoned, existing business could choose to continue operating, he said.“It’s private property, we can’t take their premises off them, but we would like to give encouragement. We’re talking about big tracts of land, there is a lot of potential out there.”Plans were already in place for all the council-owned land banks in the city, Mr Kenny said, and with Dublin facing ongoing housing shortages, in both the public and the private sector, now was the time to rezone older industrial lands. “We are running out of land. In four years’ time we won’t have any land left in the city for housing development.”The council is particularly interested in the potential of the Dublin Industrial Estate, which has an entrance opposite Glasnevin cemetery but largely sits between Cabra and Finglas south.The Government’s new Urban Development and Building Heights guidelines, which are available for public consultation for the next six weeks, stop local authorities setting “generic maximum height limits” on buildings. Increased height was “not only desirable but a fundamental policy requirement” in areas with the potential for comprehensive development such as “brownfield former industrial districts” the guidelines state.“It is Government policy that building heights must be generally increased in appropriate urban locations. There is, therefore, a presumption in favour of buildings of increased height in our towncity cores and in other urban locations with good public transport accessibility.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Spending on organisation and security ided between church and StateQuestions raised about similarities between RDS women\u0026rsquos symposium and Rome eventFreedom of Information documents reveal level of hostility to repealing the amendmentWarning comes after outbreaks of infection in neonatal intensive care unitEffects are similar to those seen in smokers and sufferers of lung diseasePressure on Brendan Howlin as Martina Genockey says it would help party rebuildOverall number of people who walk to work nationally continues to fallAll electricity at its stores and distribution centres is now green electricityIrish Cancer Society warns public may be missing early diagnosis by not visiting GPJim Logan wrote a letter wondering if anyone remembered him in his home townLabour Senator tells Parnell Summer School of being harassed as a waiter in LondonCity councillors urge caution on rezoning of lands for housing\u0026lsquoNeuromorphic\u0026rsquo computers will be able to carry out tasks natural to the human brainMargaret Cash who slept in Garda station with children would have to leave premises at 10amSon was secretly recorded threatening and abusing mother, judge toldThe pope will arrive in Ireland on August 25th for two days"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3593602.1534018029!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit france to veto re routed trade plan between ireland and europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench concern at rerouting: At stake are jobs, millions of dollars’ worth of port revenues and possibly EU infrastructure funding.France will not accept a European Commission proposal to exclude French ports from a re-routed trade corridor between Ireland and mainland Europe after Brexit, the government has said.At the moment much of Ireland’s trade with the continent goes via Britain in trucks.

I was wondering how everyone is doing back in Lahinch and is there anyone left who remembers me?”He went on: “I was born in June 1938 in Lahinch and lived in Crag from age nine to 16, when I emigrated to England. I attended national school in Lahinch and CBS in Ennistymon. It would be great to hear from anyone from that era. I wonder how many of us are left?”The letter has gone “viral” after being posted on the “Clare Clare Clare” Facebook page. The letter, according to the page, is “easily the most popular post ever on the page – over 300,000 hits and nearly 4,000 shares”.Operations director with Lonely Planet Ireland Nóirín Hegarty replied to Ennistymon CBS tweeting the letter to say: “My dad, Sean Hegarty, was in school with Jimmy Logan and remembers him well. He is going to write to him, reminding him of their antics. He has some great stories.”Mr Vaughan said on Monday that Mr Logan’s letter “conjured up a sad image for me – that one of our own would be so long without any contact with his home place”.Mr Vaughan said he had written to the sheltered accommodation address provided in Mr Logan’s letter to offer to fund a return visit to Lahinch for Mr Logan to meet some of those from that time.He said: “I don’t even know at this stage if Jim would like to travel back so if not, we can organise a small delegation to go over from here to London to cheer him up.”Mr Vaughan said that he knew of three people who had already written to Mr Logan to fill him in on who’s alive in Lahinch and news about new developments in the seaside resort.One of those who knew Jim growing up in Lahinch in the 1940s is Lahinch native Tomsie O’Sullivan.Mr O’Sullivan confirmed on Monday that he would be writing to Jim Logan to fill him in on the goings on in the village.Mr O’Sullivan said that Mr Logan’s family “were very hard workers and very well respected”.Mr O’Sullivan added that the family lived down in a house on the prom that today houses a surf shop before they moved to a council house on School Road.Mr O’Sullivan said Jim’s father was a baker and also very active in drama and fundraising for the local church in Lahinch.The  site for and about Irish-connected people around the world."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3595100.1534185352!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"%C3%B3 cu%C3%ADv wants ff to reopen decision not to contest presidential election","story":"Mr Ó Cuív, a Galway West TD, has so far refused to comment on calls from some Fianna Fáil members for him to stand as the party candidate against Mr Higgins.However, one of his local councillors in Galway, Ollie Crowe, says he has spoken to Mr Ó Cuív on a number of occasions on the issue.Mr Crowe says the former minister wants the prospect of Fianna Fáil standing a presidential candidate to be discussed at the annual parliamentary party think-in, which takes place before the return of the Dáil and Seanad after the summer recess.The think-in is at the Grand Hotel, Malahide in north Dublin, on September 11th and 12th.The call has been backed by two members of Mr Martin’s parliamentary party, Carlow Kilkenny TDs John McGuinness and Bobby Aylward. Mr Martin has already secured the backing of his TDs and senators to support Mr Higgins for a second term, but Mr McGuinness and Mr Aylward say another debate should be held.“Okay, we made a decision but we may have been premature making a decision,” Mr Aylward said. “We should clear the air. If there is dissent, then that is the place to have it, out on the floor, not in the press. I think it should be a topic for discussion if there is someone in the parliamentary party who is interested in it.”Mr McGuinness said Mr Martin made the announcement on supporting Mr Higgins’s nomination at the end of a parliamentary party meeting earlier this summer.“It wasn’t a case that we had discussed it, we hadn’t,” he said. “I’d like to see it discussed in Malahide.”In order to get on the ballot paper in a presidential election, a candidate needs the backing of four county councils or the signatures of 20 members of the Dáil or Seanad.Carlow County Council will hear from four aspiring presidential election candidates – Gavin Duffy, Joan Freeman, Kevin Sharkey and Marie Goretti Moylan, an Athlone woman – at a meeting tomorrow.However, the council is unlikely to decide who to support, if it supports anyone, until next month.Initially, Mr Crowe said Mr Ó Cuív would be willing to get a nomination through the county council route, but would now prefer to get the support of the parliamentary party. This is unlikely to happen, since Mr Martin and senior frontbench TDs have already ruled it out.However, it will still cause political difficulties for Mr Martin if Mr Ó Cuív attempts to have it discussed at the gathering in Malahide.“The decision that was taken in Leinster House was flawed because there were only 16 members in the room,” Mr Crowe said. “Éamon said he felt that if there was willingness on behalf of the Oireachtas members, it could be a discussion issue in Malahide.“Éamon said to me that he has good support within the parliamentary party, but he was hoping that support would increase when people are back from holidays and back from vacation.“I genuinely believe there is a majority of parliamentary party members who want to run a candidate."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3595167.1534186389!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and harris called godless sinners over 8th amendment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome of the correspondence questioned the celebratory scenes in Dublin Castle on the day of the referendum count. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris were referred to as “godless”, “sinners”, an “instrument of the devil” and as promoting the “legalised butchery of our children” for supporting the repeal of the Eighth Amendment.Freedom of Information documents released to The  detail\u0026nbspthe significant number of correspondence Mr Varadkar and Mr Harris received in response to the referendum on removing the constitutional ban on abortion.While there was some praise for the two politicians for their role, a large volume of what was released to The  highlighted the opposition to the referendum.There were also several pieces of correspondence questioning whether\u0026nbsp“compulsory euthanasia” would follow the introduction of abortion.In one letter sent on the day of the referendum count, Mr Harris was referred to as an “instrument of the devil” who was “pure evil”.Another piece of correspondence received by Mr Harris and Mr Varadkar after the result claimed the two had “blood on their hands”, while the writer insisted they would not pay for an “innocent and defenceless life to be taken away”.The extent of the hostility to the proposal is evident in the letters sent to the Taoiseach and the Minister in the days running up to the referendum.One writer claimed abortion was worse than the use of chemical weaponry in Syria, while another questioned how Mr Harris would justify “the crime of abortion” when he comes before “the Almighty”.In another letter sent to both the Taoiseach and the Minister, the writer questioned why abortion was necessary due to the availability of birth control.“We fought for birth control plus the pill, injections, condoms . . . This is freedom to have sex and *** get pregnant. So why would any woman not use these methods? A very irresponsible one and we seem to have those in the thousands.”The same writer said Mr Varadkar, who is a doctor, should perform abortions and not force other medical professionals to carry out the procedure.The person questioned why people should trust politicians and doctors, comparing it to people trusting serial killers Myra Hindley and Fred West.“We can abort the baby from the womb but never from the mind. The unwanted baby is trash to you all . . . I would not throw any of my animals in the bin. They are buried in the garden, they are in my heart and mind.”Abortion is “literally opening the door to hell”, one writer says, adding women who have abortions will feel “guilt, shame, depression, despair, attempted suicide and suicide”.In another handwritten letter, Mr Varadkar was informed he had no right to “kill little babies and setting up slaughter houses”.“You are lucky you have survived the slaughter of abortion. May God bless you and give you guidance,” the letter concludes.A mother-of-six wrote to Mr Harris days before people cast their vote on May 25th urging him to change his position on the referendum and stop “trying to murder all the innocent babies”.She said she was a doctor who could not support abortion, including in the case of rape.The woman wrote: “Abortion for a rape must be worse than the actual rape when one look(s) back and realise(s) I was talked into murdering this innocent child.”The Minister for Health also received a letter from a person who said abortion should not be permitted when the foetus was “created at a time not suitable for mam and dad or they are not perfect”.The letter says the “wildlife will have more protection than our unborn babies”.The issues of Down syndrome, the role of politicians in framing the legislation and the introduction of euthanasia feature in significant piece s of correspondence.In one letter to Mr Varadkar, a person says there will be “no babies” for people who vote Yes.“That will include no nieces or nephews for you and then our country will be left with an ageing population.”The writer finishes the handwritten letter urging Mr Varadkar to “do the right thing and stop the murder of innocent babies”.Mr Harris, meanwhile, received a letter from a Fine Gael supporter, who said their family had voted for the party since 1922 but would not anymore due to the Minister and the Taoiseach’s view on the Eighth Amendment.It was a “monstrously wrong” position and will change the ethos of Ireland irreversibly, the writer concludes.The correspondence released from the Department of Health includes several letters from women praising Mr Harris for his role in the referendum campaign.In a letter sent to Mr Harris after the result, one voter questioned the celebratory scenes in Dublin Castle on the day of the referendum count.The writer said the Minister may have“rejoiced at the sight of Ireland’s citizens dancing with joy at the idea of more easily available abortion” but stressed “thousands of others were weeping at the potential loss of babies to be aborted in years to come: unique children with potential gifts never to be repeated”.A Yes voter also contacted the Minister to criticise the scenes of “triumphalism and euphoria” that she had witnessed.Her decision to support the referendum had followed much heartache and deliberation and the celebrations had made her feel sick, the mother said.“I am the mother of a Yes campaigner, the daughter of a devastated No voter, the sister-in-law of someone who had an abortion and the wife of someone who believes the proposed legislation is too liberal.”Get the latest news and best analysis about the Referendum on the regulation of termination of pregnancy here"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3594575.1534156299!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irishman s disappearance in australia turns neighbour against neighbour","story":"Police in Australia are investigating the disappearance of 70-year-old Irish man Paddy Moriarty from the remote town of Larrimah. In 2011 Moriarty spoke to ABC News about feuding among local residents of Larrimah. Video: ABC News\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaddy Moriarty (70): missing since December 2016. He was last seen in the Australian outback town of Larrimah, where he lived. Photograph: courtesy ABC NewsDusk was falling on the sweltering hot day of December 16th, 2017, when Irishman Paddy Moriarty went to the Pink Panther, the only hotel and bar in this tiny, dusty town, to end the day with his usual round of drinks.He downed eight beers, typical for Moriarty, a labourer who emigrated from Ireland in the 1960s.Then he left for home with his dog by his side. He was never seen again. Neither was his dog, a Kelpie named Kellie.Four days later, when the police arrived in Larrimah, a Northern Territory town of just 11 people, they entered Moriarty’s unlocked house to find a cowboy hat on a cooler box and a barbecue chicken still in the microwave. The authorities suspect foul play and have been treating the case as a homicide, with every single person in Larrimah – all 11 of them – being probed for clues.Topping the list of potential suspects now – at least going by the questioning in a recent inquest involving the town’s residents – are a former Pink Panther bartender, who was one of the last people to see the missing man, and a gardener, with whom Moriarty had fought just days before his disappearance. Detectives have also questioned the owner of a roadside teahouse, leading to morbid jokes about the filling in her meat pies.But with no clear evidence or even a motive for Moriarty’s disappearance, every one of Larrimah’s 11 residents is in one way or another part of the investigation – with each pointing a finger at a neighbour or two, while denying their own involvement in what has become the latest mystery to capture Australia’s imagination.There are only two gathering places for residents and visitors, the Pink Panther and Fran’s Devonshire Tea House. I started with the former, a musty pub and hotel where Moriarty, 70, was last seen. “Paddy used to be here nearly every day, I miss him so much,” said one of Moriarty’s closest friends, Barry Sharpe, 76, the publican of the Pink Panther.All Sharpe said he knew about the disappearance was that his friend did not show up for “church”, a Sunday morning ritual in which residents gather in the Pink Panther’s front room to watch Landline, the nation’s premier rural affairs programme. It was then that locals sounded the alarm.A three-day search by foot, on four-wheel-drives and from the air ruled out death by misadventure. One of the last people to see Moriarty was Richard Simpson, the one-time bartender at the Pink Panther, who has a reputation for volatility. “He was every day drunk before lunch,” Sharpe said of Simpson, his former employee. “Not only smashed, but not very pleasant.”Simpson scoffed at similar accusations when asked about them during the coroner’s inquest, a public hearing in which witnesses are questioned in open court. Upon being told that some people in Larrimah thought he had something to do with the disappearance, Simpson declared them all fools.He instead suggested that the police should be looking elsewhere – down the main road at the Tea House. The next day, that’s where I went. “I’ve got no pies left,” a short woman with spiked blond hair shrieked from the kitchen. Recreational vehicles lined up outside as patrons spilled out to buy tea and pies, despite online reviews warning of “rubbish food” and questionable prices.The cook, Fran Hodgetts, 75, has long prided herself on her scones and meat pies. She often tells visitors they are famous around the world. Now, though, they are renowned for all the wrong reasons. “I reckon he’s in the pie,” joked Robyn Duignan, a visitor from Victoria who had been following Moriarty’s case in the news media and stopped by to see if there had been any developments. “He went through the mincer,” Duignan added from the Tea House’s garden, a yard scattered with old toys and signs trumpeting Hodgetts’ culinary expertise.Moriarty and Hodgetts were neighbours who often clashed, the police said. He lived directly across the main road from the Tea House, and several people in town said it had annoyed him when her customers parked on his property. As payback, residents said, Moriarty routinely told them not to eat her food because nothing was homemade or fresh, adding that even his dog would not eat her pies.If Moriarty had enemies, he also had allies: Years ago, when Sharpe, the publican from the Pink Panther, decided his crocodile Sam was not enough of an attraction, he started selling his own meat pies. Moriarty advertised those pies in front of his house with a massive sign that read: “Larrimah Hotel Best Pies in Town.”The testimony from Hodgetts, sitting on the stand in a tiny courtroom in the nearby town of Katherine, was part of an investigation by the Northern Territory coroner, a special magistrate assigned to determine the cause and manner of Moriarty’s death.Early on, the focus fell on Hodgetts. Bobby Roth, a Larrimah local of 19 years, who used to wash dishes at the Tea House, said the cafe owner didn’t like Moriarty. “She used to say, ‘I’ll kill Paddy,’” Roth said at one point, breaking into tears. But during her own testimony, Hodgetts ended up shifting attention to her gardener, Owen Laurie, 71, a tall, burly man who was known for keeping to himself, and for taking good care of the Tea House plants.The questioning centred on an argument that he and Moriarty had about Kellie, Moriarty’s dog, three days before they disappeared. That day, Kellie had been barking at the Tea House from a spot in the middle of the road. An argument between Moriarty and Laurie ensued, according to testimony, with Laurie shouting at Moriarty to shut the dog up “or I’ll shut it up for you.”Hodgetts went a step further, telling the court Laurie tried to “jump the fence.” “I told him, ‘Don’t do anything stupid,’” Hodgetts said. Laurie admitted to having a bad temper, but he denied any involvement, turning the court’s attention back to where Moriarty was last seen: The Pink Panther.Simpson no longer works at the pub. Sharpe said he was fired a week before the coroner’s inquest – a few days before I arrived to find his room there a mess of dirty clothes and empty beer cans. He appeared to have moved on and has since been replaced by someone else, keeping Larrimah’s population steady at 11. It used to be 12.Around the bar, patrons still talk about Moriarty’s disappearance. “Church” on Sundays has resumed, but without the charm Moriarty used to bring to it. Because he had no family in Australia, the public trustee now controls his property. To keep an eye on anything that might look suspicious, his home has been fitted with security cameras, and it’s flanked by a large missing-person sign.It includes a picture of Moriarty, smiling, with a question many in town are still asking: “What happened to Paddy?”"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

But the truth must be established. Is is a question of honour,” said Mr de Causans, whose full name is Louis Jean Raymond Marie de Vincens de Causans.But he insisted that he was not aiming to dethrone his cousin Prince Albert, the current monarch of the principality and head of the princely house of Grimaldi, despite the fact that he believes that his own uncle should be on the throne today.“I have nothing against Prince Albert, who had nothing to do with all of this. It is France which caused the damage,” the 44-year-old told Le Parisien newspaper.Princess Caroline of Hanover, Prince Albert II of Monaco and Princess Stephanie of Monaco attend the National Day Parade as part of Monaco National Day Celebrations at Monaco Palace on November 19, 2013 The dispute dates back to just over a century ago when the then Prince Louis II of Monaco had no official heir.This meant that the next in line for the throne of Monaco was his first cousin Wilhelm, the Duke of Urach, a German nobleman.But for France, on the brink of World War I, the idea of a German ruling Monaco was simply unacceptable,” said Jean-Marc Descoubès, Mr de Causans’ lawyer.The throne should then have passed to Mr de Causans’ branch of the Grimaldi family, the artistocrat argues.Instead a law was passed in 1911 recognizing Louis’ illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, the daughter of his cabaret singer lover Marie-Juliette Louvet, as his heir and making her part of the princely family.This law was later declared invalid but another one was passed in 1918 that established Charlotte as the heir.France and Monaco also signed a treaty that stated that the French government would henceforth have the final say on all future contenders for the Monégasque throne.Mr de Causans’ lawyer says that it is clear that the current rulers of Monaco are in their position solely by the will of the French state.This is the base of his claim for the €351 million in damages he believes his client is entitled to, which he points out is a mere fraction of the entire wealth of the Grimaldis who rule Monaco.He has sent his claim to the French foreign ministry, which has two months to respond.If no satisfactory response is received within that time, the case will likely go to court.“Today what I want is for the truth to come out and this injustice done to my family by France to be put right,” said Mr de Causans.Manchester homes evacuated as firefighters tackle huge mill blazeElderly should be housed in luxury developments with spas to keep them out of care homes   Male model \u0026#39obsessed\u0026#39 with copying look of his rival convicted of his murderCoach carrying children overturns on M25 injuring 41 people as hospital declares \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39Unemployed female law graduate \u0026#39housewife\u0026#39 wins half of ex-girlfriend\u0026#39s £1.7m homeRuby Rose deletes Twitter after critics suggest she is not lesbian \u0026#39enough\u0026#39 to play new BatwomanDramatic video shows US police rescue dogs from California wildfireUK will have 9 million more pensioners in 50 years, official figures showTrainline scandal: Passengers charged double for Government-run railway tickets Bollywood: The World’s Biggest Film Industry, review: a fascinating look at this vibrant, uplifting worldExam boards launch review as parents exploit loophole to get students extra timeBenjamin Netanyahu says Jeremy Corbyn should be denounced by all over wreath-laying for Munich massacre terrorists UK weather: Britain on flood alert as thunderstorms to bring \u0026#39intense\u0026#39 rainStrictly Come Dancing 2018: Red Dwarf star Danny John-Jules is the third celebrity to join the line-upStrictly Come Dancing 2018: Steps singer Faye Tozer is the second celebrity to join the line-upDonald Trump says aide Omarosa wasn\u0026#39t fired sooner because she said \u0026#39great things\u0026#39 about himProminent Bangladeshi blogger in hiding over fears for his lifeViktor Orban moves to ban gender studies courses at university in \u0026#39dangerous precedent\u0026#39 for HungaryComment: What Englishman could resist the temptation of having his own moat?Comment: Boris Johnson is right to lambast stamp duty – but the Tories need to go much furtherPatients suffered \u0026#39severe harm\u0026#39 after NHS hospital lost track of themWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"englishman could resist temptation having moat","story":"Leeds castle: one of the greatest moats of them allFew people would have expected the moat to make a comeback.

twitter critics suggest not lesbian enough","story":"Rose has been cast as Batwoman who is portrayed as a lesbian in the new series, expected to air in late 2019 or 2020The actress set to play the first openly gay superhero has deleted her Twitter account after receiving abuse and claims she is not gay enough for the role.Australian Ruby Rose, who describes herself as gender fluid, was announced as the new Batwoman for an upcoming TV series last week. The series will see Batwoman\u0027s alter ego, Kate Kane, portrayed as a lesbian, and is expected to air in late 2019 or 2020.The character has been openly gay since 2006, in an effort by DC Comics to make its publications more erse.Rose, 32, said she has faced a barrage of negative tweets about her own sexuality since the announcement, including questions over her sexuality. In one, a critic wrote Rose had been selected as a \u0027hot\u0027 white person that isn’t too gay to offend the straights.Rose wrote on Instagram: The Bat is out of the bag and I am beyond thrilled and honouredIn a final series of tweets before deleting her account, the actress wrote: Where on earth did \u0027Ruby is not a lesbian therefore she can\u0027t be Batwoman\u0027 come from? Has to be the funniest, most ridiculous thing I\u0027ve ever read.I came out at 12? And have for the past five years had to deal with \u0027she\u0027s too gay\u0027. How do y\u0027all flip it like that? I didn\u0027t change. I wish we would all support each other and our journeys.But hey, love a challenge. I just wish women and the LGBT community supported each other more.I am looking forward to getting more than four hours of sleep and to break from Twitter to focus all my energy on my next two projects. If you need me, I\u0027ll be on my Bat Phone.Rose says she was taking a break from Twitter to focus on her next two projectsRose, who made a name for herself in Netflix series Orange Is The New Black, also changed her Instagram profile so that only people she knows can comment on her posts.Rose previously told US talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that she was thrilled to be playing Batwoman and that she used to make bat wings and jump off high places as a child.Best superhero movies of all timeThe tearful star added: I feel like the reason I kept getting so emotional is because when I was growing up watching TV, I never saw someone I could identify with, let alone a superhero.She will be introduced as Batwoman in a December crossover event between other DC Comics shows Arrow, The Flash and

smithers","story":"Created with Sketch.If students\u0026nbspwith unconditional\u0026nbspoffers \u0027take their foot off the pedal\u0027\u0026nbspthey may not\u0026nbspget\u0026nbsphigh gradesClick to followThe Independent OnlineStudents may have ‘taken their foot off the pedal’ during exams following a rise in guaranteed places on degree coursesThe soaring number of unconditional offers handed out by universities could lead to a drop in the proportion of exams awarded the top grades this week, experts have suggested.Students may have “taken their foot off the pedal” following a rise in guaranteed places on degree courses, resulting in a potential drop in the percentage of A or A* grades, academics have said.Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, added that major reforms to A-levels in England – as well as a rise of unconditional offers – could bring down the overall pass rate for the highest grades this year.His warnings come ahead of A-level results day on Thursday, when\u0026nbspthousands of students across the country will find out what grades they have got in their exams and what university they may study at.Recent figures published by Ucas showed that nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of teenagers have received at least one unconditional offer this year amid competition to attract candidates.In total, almost 68,000 of these offers have been made to 18-year-olds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year, up from less than 3,000 just five years ago.The issue has sparked concerns from ministers and school leaders, who have argued the practice undermines the credibility of the university system and puts youngsters’ futures at risk.If those given a guaranteed offer “really take their foot off the pedal, they may not be getting the high grades that they might otherwise have done”, Professor Smithers said.There have also been major changes to A-levels in England – with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course. Last year, the first grades were awarded in the first 13 subjects to be reformed – and the proportion of top grades fell in these subjects.A further 11 A-level subjects – including languages, geography, dance, drama and theatre, music, PE and religious studies – have now been reformed with grades awarded for the first time this year.Professor Smithers said: “Putting together the fact that 24 of the most frequently taken A-levels have changed in England, and that we’ve got unconditional offers operating, they’re likely to bring the results down a bit.”But the exams regulator Ofqual has said they will make sure that students are not penalised for being the first to take new exams – as final grades would be fairly distributed.Experts have also predicted that boys will score more A and A* grades than girls in the new A-levels, which are tested by exams, rather than coursework.On unconditional offers, Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “If there is a dip in the top grades, it could well be due to youngsters taking their foot off the gas. I do think it’s something that we have to look at.”He added: “We’re very concerned that universities are doing this to get bums on seats.“Whereas, in fact what should be happening in the process is that students are on the most appropriate degree provision for them, for what their potential career progression is going to be, and if the nature of the course that they’re doing is best suited to them.”Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of vice-chancellors’\u0026nbspgroup Universities UK, said that unconditional offers still account for a small proportion (7.1 per cent) of all offers made.He said: “They are made in a range of circumstances.These include when applicants already have qualifications or extensive practical and relevant experience for courses such as music or journalism.“They can also be awarded where evidence suggests applicants are clearly on track to exceed the required entry grades, and to those from disadvantaged backgrounds with the potential to do well at university with extra support.“Unconditional offers, when used appropriately, can help students and ensure that universities are able to respond flexibly to the range of applicants seeking places.“Universities UK will continue to work with Ucas to monitor trends and any impact unconditional offer-making might have on exam results.”UK news in picturesCommunities Secretary James Brokenshire today launched a £100 million pound government fund to end rough sleeping in England within the next decade.

These reforms will ensure students have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed both in further study and in the workplace.‎\u0026nbsp“Ofqual has been clear that the qualification standard for A-levels remains the same, meaning a student who would have previously achieved an A grade would still do so in the reformed qualification.‎ GCSEs are more rigorous and both teachers and pupils rose to the challenge of the new exams last year.\u0026nbsp“Ofqual always ensures no student is disproportionately affected by changes to qualifications, as they do each year for any new exam.

Instead, David Barnett’s got something that he thinks is invaluableClick to followThe Independent OnlineI asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, ‘You have to write every day’If you are one of the millions of people who aspire to be a published author, I have some writing advice for you: never listen to writing advice.Not that it’s easy to avoid. If you go on Twitter and follow the hashtag #amwriting you’ll get more unsolicited advice than you know what to do with. Do this, do that, don’t on any account do the other. Everyone it seems, has some rules for you to follow.Which is hardly surprising, as literally almost everybody is writing a book. And I use the phrase “literally almost everybody” advisedly. At the BookExpo America conference in 2015, author Jane McGonigal claimed that 90 per cent\u0026nbspof young people in the US say they want to write a book.That’s a lot of potential authors… in fact, if my quick calculations are right, and we take “young people” to be up to the age of 24, that means 75.6 million young people in the States\u0026nbsphave aspirations to be novelists. That’s 10 million more people than the entire population of the UK, and doesn’t take into account all those over the age of 25. Which, in a country where the illiteracy rate is something like 14 per cent, is frankly astonishing.And possibly crap. Here’s not some writing advice for you, but an honest-to-goodness law, as laid down by the science fiction author Theodore Sturgeon: 90 per cent\u0026nbspof everything is crap. Curiously, that’s the same percentage as the young population of America which wants to write a book. And –\u0026nbspthough I have as much scientific backup for this as Sturgeon did for his law –\u0026nbspthe same percentage of writing advice, I’d warrant, that also qualifies as crap.Why am I so down on writing advice? Because it’s often so prescriptive, as though there’s only one way to skin a cat. Which there isn’t. The reason a lot of us do genuinely like to hear about authors’ writing processes is because they’re very often wildly different from each other.If they were all the same –\u0026nbspand edicts about how you should and shouldn’t go about writing would wrongly suggest they are – then we’d only have to hear Neil Gaiman or Gillian Flynn or JK Rowling explain the process once at some book festival, and we’d know how everyone does it.It’s also rather annoying that writers feel the need to issue edicts, as though writing is actually some magical, special, superhuman process that mere mortals can only aspire to. Let’s get this right, writing a book isn’t easy. Writing a good book is harder still. Writing a book that is not just good, but great, and worthy of a publisher throwing money at you, is very, very difficult. But it’s also not rocket science, nor brain surgery. Which is evident by the almost complete absence of rocket scientists and brain surgeons offering Twitter advice on their particular disciplines.mojitos,’ Ernest reminded himselfAnd that may be because, apart from a few tweaks here and there, there really is only one way to science a rocket or surgeon a brain.There’s no room for experimentation, for doing it at your own pace, for finding your own path. Which – advice, ahoy! – are all things you should be doing if you decide to write a book.A couple of months ago the writer Flic Everett tweeted: “I wish plumbers were as fascinated by themselves as some writers are. They could post little ‘plumbing is so tough, need coffee!!’ memes and be all humble about their plumbing awards and recognise each other on Twitter via the hashtag #amplumbing”.You don’t get that much, do you? There is very rarely advice or bragging from plumbers along the lines of “You need to put at least one toilet in a week if you’re going to call yourself a pipe monkey!” or “sealed a dozen pipes with PTFE tape this weekend – no rest for the real plumber!”So I asked Twitter what sort of writing advice they see a lot which really annoys them. By far the most unpopular edict was the oft-trotted out, “You have to write every day.” The adjunct to this is usually that your daily output should generally be about 1,000 words.As with all writing advice, there’s a grain of common sense in it. If you are planning to write a book, then at some point you should actually, you know, put some words together. But there’s nothing enshrined in law that says you have to do this every single day, nor do the requisite 1,000 words, which could be three or four hours’ work, or more, for the fledgling writer.Women gain on men in Forbes list of top earning authorsThis is an example of the “advice” which some writers come out with which is disguised as inspirational but is actually thinly veiled macho bullshit designed to paint the author in question as some kind of tough-as-old-boots Hemingway-esque hard man of letters.Similarly, there are many pronouncements that to be a writer you have to give up all of your free time. Again, a kernel of truth novels don’t write themselves. You’re going to have to steal that time from somewhere, whether it’s foregoing Love Island or getting up an hour earlier, or going to bed an hour later.\u0026nbspBut I saw a Friday tweet recently saying something along the lines of, oh, it’s the weekend again, or as we writers know it, 48 hours of hard work and crushing anxiety. Statements like this suggest as a writer you aren’t allowed free time, that weekends are for locking yourself away from your loved ones and sweating words. Which, sometimes, they are, especially if you’ve got a deadline approaching. But weekends, and evenings, and bank holidays… they should be for recharging and relaxing as well.\u0026nbspAgain, it’s more to do with the person making the statement than any real advice for would-be writers. It’s the Hemingway thing again. Get up at 5am. Write a thousand words. Have three mojitos for breakfast. Go and wrestle a shark. Make violent love to a woman. Smoke a cigar. Skip lunch. Write another thousand words. Be a real goddam writer! Sleep when your dead!Such “advice” is actually counter-productive to the new writer, and I suspect that’s kind of the point. Those setting out on the writing journey might look in awe at @RealGoddamWriter (if that’s actually a genuine account, I apologise in advance) and think, “Well, it’s good of them to share these vital rules for writing, but given that I have a day job and two kids and really, really, really want to watch Love Island tonight, I’m never going to be as good as this person so I’ll just go and weep into my Scrivener app.”Gaiman (Getty)Oh, here’s another piece of most-hated advice from my quick Twitter survey: write what you know. This can be a double-edged sword, because if you do know some good stuff, or have had a few life experiences, it’s not a bad idea to utilise it. Had kids? You’ll know what childbirth feels like. Lost a loved one? You can write bereavement from a position of knowledge. Done a bit of brain surgery? Well, what are you writing a novel for? There’s no money in it, you know.But if we all confined ourselves to writing what we have direct experience of, there’d be no science fiction or fantasy novels. I had a novel published last year about a man on his way to Mars. Come closer, I have a secret: I’m not an astronaut and have never been to space.It’s also a little curious that most writing advice on social media comes from authors who you might not necessarily class as bestsellers. Now, I’m not suggesting only those writers who make the top ten are worth a damn, but unsolicited rules and edicts usually come from authors who are not exactly household names.In fact, call me shallow, but when big-name authors do offer advice, I listen. One of my favourite books – and if you want to write anything yourself, you could do worse than check\u0026nbspit out – is On Writing by Stephen King. It’s partly a memoir, and partly an exploration of his own writing process.\u0026nbspIt’s hugely interesting and inspirational, but it’s also a book that is there only if you seek it out. King\u0026nbsp(and I could be wrong here, but I don’t think I am) rarely takes to Twitter to tell other people how to write. Indeed, in his second foreword in the book he writes: “This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bullshit. Fiction writers, present company included, don’t understand very much about what they do – not why it works when it’s good, not why it doesn’t when it’s bad. I figured the shorter the book, the less the bullshit.”I’m also fond of what Neil Gaiman said in his 2012 keynote speech to the University of the Arts, which was basically that the best thing to do is ignore advice and plough your own furrow, because then\u0026nbspyou don’t know what you’re doing is considered wrong: “People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them.”Of course, big-name writers have also been prescriptive. Raymond Chandler wrote his Ten Commandments for writing a detective novel. But then, Chandler was a genius, and he put together his rules (sample: it must be honest with the reader) seven or eight decades ago, and didn’t clog up my Twitter feed with them.Even Hemingway, our tough guy of American letters, offered writing guidance here and there. Strangely, very little of it was to do with wrestling bears or typing while running away from bulls. In fact, one of this best nuggets, which is from his memoir A Moveable Feast, is actually advice to himself on getting over writer’s block: “Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.”BBC presenter with terminal cancer writes touching memoir for sonThe greetings you should avoid when writing an emailLove Island’s Niall Aslam is writing a book about Aspergers syndromeWhen I asked people on Twitter for their most hated writing advice, I also asked for the most useful. Practically everyone said the same thing, and I offer it to you now. You may, of course, ignore it completely, but all I can say is, I think you’d be wise not to.The advice is this: if you want to write, then read. Read novels in the area that you’re writing. Read novels in the area that you’re not writing. Read non-fiction. Read the news. Read the back of a Coco-Pops box. Learn how sentences are put together, how stories work, how novels are structured. Learn how Coco-Pops are made, because you never know when you’ll need that information.You wouldn’t expect to play for England without ever watching a football match, no matter how good you think you are hoofing a battered old leather ball around the park on your own.

These included 97 English seats, 14 in Wales and one in Scotland.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.47 Rights of EU citizens living the UKThe Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.57 Future trade agreement (with the EU)Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.Under the Focaldata model, 341 constituencies now have a Remain majority, up from 229 in 2016.The analysis, conducted for the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum and the Hope Not Hate campaign against racism, puts Remain on 53 per cent support, against 47 per cent backing Leave.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, who spoke at a rally of People’s Vote supporters in Bristol on Saturday, said: “Whether someone voted to leave or stay in the EU in 2016, nearly everyone is disillusioned by the mess the Conservatives have made of Brexit.“This research is yet more compelling evidence that the British people must be given the final say on any – or no – Brexit deal. The shallow argument against giving the people their say diminishes towards nothingness with every passing day.”Sir Vince told the Bristol rally that opponents of Brexit must work together “as a team” across party ides in the drive for a second EU referendum.The Lib Dem leader said it was clear the “centre of gravity” on Brexit is shifting in favour of a national poll on the final deal.Sir Vince told the rally that since the 52 per cent-48 per cent victory for Leave in 2016, “the situation has changed, the facts have changed”.“We were all told the British government was going to save vast amounts of money,” he said. “We now know that’s not the case: there’s the £40bn orce settlement, the economy’s slowing down, there’s less money for the NHS.“We were told it was simple – it’s actually proving unbelievably complicated.“Another thing that’s happened in the last two years is Trump. The whole premise of Britain embarking on some buccaneering free trading adventure around the world as a country independent of the EU has been completely negated by Trump’s protectionist agenda. This has made a complete and utter nonsense of it.“So our position in arguing against Brexit and for a people’s vote is now stronger than ever.“But we have to work together we have to work across party frontiers.”And he said: “This is a campaign that we can win. Keep fighting, keep campaigning and we will win at the end of this.”He was joined by Conservative MP for Totnes Sarah Wollaston, who said: “To proceed with Brexit without a People’s Vote would be like a surgeon carrying out an amputation having sought their patient’s consent two years beforehand without either of them knowing whether they were going to lose a few toes or their whole leg.“Informed consent to Brexit can only happen once people know the final deal – if any – and have clear information about the risks as well as any benefits.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/16/rtx2afmi.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1798  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/09/16/rtx2afmi.jpg","title":"brexit leave campaign remainers peoples vote final say yougov survey","story":"Created with Sketch.Not being seen as the establishment was key to Leave’s success in the 2016 referendumClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit: Leave campaign no longer viewed as anti-establishment movement as Remainers turn to insurgent strategyThe campaign to Remain in the European Union is no longer overwhelmingly seen as the “establishment” movement in the Brexit debate, according to new polling.The survey by YouGov found that after months of the government negotiating to quit the EU, many British people see\u0026nbspLeave\u0026nbspas the establishment movement in the ongoing debate about the UK’s future.The finding is significant because at the 2016 referendum Leave was bolstered by its image as an anti-establishment crusade, while Remain was hindered by the perception that it was the campaign of the government and business elite.Leaders of the People’s Vote group, who commissioned the poll, told The Independent the shift will mark a change in their campaign strategy to more insurgent-style tactics.A senior source at People’s Vote said: “For too long our side of the argument has been, sometimes unfairly, seen as the establishment telling the people they got it wrong two years ago.“We now have the chance to give voice to millions of people who feel the establishment has screwed Brexit up over the past two years and want to take back control of the process through a People’s Vote.”The source added: “We will be making the case that the likes of Michael Gove are the establishment now – they are in power, they are doing this to you.” \u0026nbspRees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011The YouGov poll\u0026nbspof more than 10,000 people found that Leave campaigners are now regarded as “the establishment” by 34 per cent of voters, while those seeking to stay in the EU are regarded as such by 35 per cent.Asked if Leave campaigners understood the concerns of ordinary people, 27 per cent said they did while 54 disagreed.

Independent launched its campaign to win a Final Say Brexit referendum for the British people just three weeks ago – with more than 610,000 people signing our petition so far.Late last month pollsters asked some 1,500 respondents:\u0026nbsp“Should a Brexit deal be reached between Britain and the EU, to what extent would you support or oppose a referendum being held asking the public whether they accept or reject the terms of the deal?”At the time, 44 per cent backed the idea, with 27 per cent opposing, 15 per cent not having strong opinions either way and 14 per cent saying they did not know.But four weeks later, amid increasing public isions over Ms May’s Brexit plans, from both inside and outside the Conservatives, 48 per cent now want another referendum.Opposition has also dropped

YouGov poll for the People’s Vote campaign, also pushing for a new referendum, found 50 per cent of people want a new referendum if no deal can be reached with Brussels.The Independent’s BMG survey\u0026nbspfound that feeling has also hardened against the prime minister personally since July, at which point 46 per cent of people said she should be replaced if she cannot find a deal her cabinet agrees to, increasing to 49 per cent this month.In July more than half of people, 51 per cent, believed a new election would be needed if Ms May was ditched as Tory leader, with slightly more, 52 per cent, saying the same this month.While Ms May appears to have reached a temporary truce with her own ministers through her chequers deal – which would see the UK stay in a single market for goods, but not services, and implement a complex customs arrangement – deep reservations still exist over the plan.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP

In the weeks after the blaze, Mr Javid admitted the Tories had “failed” on housing and promised a “fundamental rethink”.Publishing the document, the government said it was prioritising ensuring social homes are safe and good quality, and giving tenants the power to hold landlords to account.As part of this,\u0026nbspthe social housing regulator will be given new powers to intervene and ensure landlords are maintaining homes to a decent standard. The process of dealing with tenants’ complaints will also be sped up.League tables could\u0026nbspalso be used to assess\u0026nbsplandlords based on how well their properties are maintained and how they treat tenants.Separately, legislation will be introduced to protect the rights of domestic violence victims who have been given a social home for life.Ministers said they were\u0026nbspalso prioritising tackling the stigma around social housing, and increasing the overall number of social homes being built.They have launched a separate consultation of how councils are spending the money they receive from selling homes through the right to buy scheme, which critics say\u0026nbspis a major cause of the diminishing number of social homes in the UK.Less than half of the revenue\u0026nbspgenerated by right to buy sales currently goes\u0026nbsptowards the cost of building new homes. Instead, almost a fifth goes to the Treasury and a quarter is used by councils to pay off debts.Ninety per cent fewer social homes are being built now than when the Conservatives\u0026nbspcame to power in 2010, while 230,000 low cost homes are forecast to be lost between 2010 and 2020.More than 8,000 people have already fed into the government’s green paper, and more views will be sought during the consultation period, which is set to close in November.Publication of the document\u0026nbsphad already been delayed by several weeks, leading to it being released in the middle of parliament’s summer break.Labour said the proposals in the paper would do nothing to increase the supply of social homes.John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: “This\u0026nbsppitiful document reveals a government that has run out of ideas on housing. Nothing in this green paper measures up to the scale of the housing crisis.“The number of new social rented homes is at a record low but there is no new money to increase supply, and ministers are still preventing local authorities run by all parties from building the council homes their communities need.“After eight years of failure on housing, ministers should back Labour’s long-term plan for a million new genuinely affordable homes over 10\u0026nbspyears.”Number of social homes to fall by 230,000 by 2020, analysis revealsFewer social homes being built than at any time since Second World WarMore than 500,000 social homes fail basic health and safety standardsCouncil leaders also said the plan did not go far enough.Judith Blake, the Local Government Association’s\u0026nbsphousing\u0026nbspspokesperson, said: “This green paper is a step towards delivering more\u0026nbspsocial\u0026nbsphomes but it is only a small step, compared with the huge and immediate need for more genuinely affordable homes.“There is a desperate need to reverse the decline in council\u0026nbsphousing\u0026nbspover the past few decades.”She added: “The government must go beyond the limited measures announced so far, scrap the\u0026nbsphousing\u0026nbspborrowing cap\u0026nbspand enable all councils\u0026nbspacross the country\u0026nbspto borrow to build once more.“This would trigger a\u0026nbsprenaissance in council house-building, which will help people to access genuinely affordable\u0026nbsphousing.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/08/23/paulette-jordan.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/08/23/paulette-jordan.jpg","title":"deb haaland mma lesbian native american congresswoman new mexico","story":"Created with Sketch.Sharice Davids\u0026nbspsupports expanded health care access, gun control and opposes President Donald Trump\u0027s tax breaksClick to followThe Independent USEx-MMA fighter could become first lesbian Native American congresswomanIf Sharice Davids prevails in November, she would represent several firsts in Congress, she would be the first lesbian congresswoman from Kansas\u0026nbspand she would be\u0026nbspbe one of the first Native American women in Congress.Deb Haaland, who won the Democratic\u0026nbspprimary\u0026nbspin New Mexico, could also be elected in November, but Ms Davids\u0026nbspwould be the first congresswoman who was once a professional mixed martial arts fighter.She became the Democratic nominee in the 3rd Congressional District in Kansas earlier this week.\u0026nbspThat sets her up against the incumbent\u0026nbspKevin Yoder, a Republican who has served since 2011.Ms Davids defeated five other Democratic candidates, including Brent Welder, who earned support and a campaign rally appearance from two stars of the progressive left, Sen.

Well, I was wrong about the messy divorce.Bam! This week Angelina claimed that Brad wasn’t paying her enough child support.Kapow! He hit back that he has coughed up over £7million since they first split over 18 months ago.Sock! Angelina then put the boot in by saying that most of the money was just a loan that she’s having to pay back with interest.Wham! He claims she wants to manipulate the media into branding him a deadbeat dad.It once again proves that no one knows what’s going on inside someone else’s marriage.It might look perfect bliss on the outside, but we have no idea what tense battles are being fought on a daily basis behind closed doors.Despite us all being spoon-fed stories of their perfect relationship over the years, and shown photos of their wedding when the children drew pictures on Angelina’s beautiful white dress, it appears that this relationship has been on the rocks for quite some time.Brad’s friends claim she is fired up with anger over the custody battle and doesn’t want the children to have any sort of relationship with their father.They have slammed her for going public instead of having the divorce hammered out in front of a private judge.Her friends counterclaim that he drank too much and was “rough” with one of the children, thought to be Maddox, the eldest, while they were on a private plane.He was cleared of any wrongdoing, but mud sticks and this was highly damaging as well as deeply distressing for Brad.These two extremely gifted, pampered, beautiful people might have met on a movie set and become infatuated with each other, but this is not a film.This is real life and there are six bewildered youngsters caught up in the eye of the storm.There’s the aforementioned Maddox, 17, then Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and ten-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.Shiloh and the twins are the biological children of Brad and Angelina, but they have all been brought up to think of themselves as full brothers and sisters, and just one big family.So it must now be extremely unsettling for them to see all the news reports about custody fights and money squabbles, and to have witnessed friends of their parents forced into taking sides.I have no idea whether the children witnessed any arguments or screaming matches between their parents, but there surely must have been an uncomfortable atmosphere at home in the months before the split.The poor, wee children actually have their own psychiatrists that Brad’s friends claim he pays for.And they have round-the-clock bodyguards available.As with so many splits, money has reared its ugly head, and despite their enormous wealth (it’s estimated that Brad is worth £202million and that Angelina has a personal fortune of £125million) it would appear that it’s all coming down to cold, hard cash.We are a long, long way from the heady Brangelina days when they were the world’s sexiest couple and couldn’t keep their hands off each other.Sadly, most white-hot affairs tend to fizzle out when domesticity kicks in and you need to change nappies and wipe snot from little faces.Even with a team of nannies, six children running around is probably one of the biggest passion killers of all time.So, it’s a real shame that Brad and Angelina couldn’t make it work, but sadder still that their dirty washing is being aired for all the world to see.But theirs is not the only love story to turn rancid . . .ROMEO and Juliet ended in tragedy at the end of Gone With The Wind, Rhett tells Scarlett that he doesn’t give a damn about her reality TV romances rarely last beyond the first glossy magazine spread.I’M not in the least bit surprised that doctors don’t trust us to tell the truth when it comes to how much booze we guzzle.Apparently they nod wisely when we solemnly declare that we have but one small sherry on a Sunday night while watching Songs of Praise, and then they simply double whatever we say or put down a number that seems most likely.New info this week says that just 40 per cent of patients tell the truth to their GPs when it comes to how much they drink every week.Frankly, I’m astonished the figure is that high.Most of us play down our booze intake and exaggerate the amount of exercise we do, but even as we are telling such huge porkies, we all know in our hearts that our doctors aren’t the least bit fooled.We want them to think we are model citizens and that our bodies are temples, but in the long run we need to tell the truth so we can get a proper diagnosis and treatment.And always bear in mind you can’t kid a kidder.There are lots of doctors who overindulge and they know all the tricks and cover-ups.IT’S the final episode of The Handmaid’s Tale tomorrow night, and I will be watching from behind the sofa to find out the fate of our heroine June.She inhabits a world where women have no rights, and handmaids are ritually raped, mutilated and even killed.It’s not easy viewing, but Elisabeth Moss has been mesmerising throughout as June, whose first child was ripped from her arms, and whose newborn baby was also taken away from her.I’m bracing myself for an emotional rollercoaster and Miss Moss should clear her sideboard for a slew of awards.The Handmaid’s Tale, Sunday, Channel 4, 9pm.WHAT sad news to discover that Margot Kidder, who shone so very brightly as the feisty and fiercely intelligent Lois Lane in the original Superman movies, died by suicide.Margot’s death happened back in May, but it was revealed this week that she died as a rfesult of a “self-inflicted drug and alcohol overdose”.The 69-year-old suffered from depression and other mental health issues, which became worse after a car accident in 1990 left her wheelchair-bound for almost two years and facing mounting debts.She had a very tough time but she tried hard to sort out her life and cope with her illness.We should remember her in her heyday.I loved the fact she wasn’t a conventional glamour puss at a time when any actress playing the “love interest” in an action movie was usually a busty blonde doing little more than squeaking and waiting to be rescued.Lois Lane was a kick-ass reporter who adored Superman but also made fun of him during four movies between 1978 and 1987.Those films had real heart and soul and – if you ignore the rather wobbly special effects – are far more entertaining than many of the over-long, over-loud and rather self-important superhero movies of today.I’M no fan of his, but I don’t think Boris Johnson should be forced to apologise for

uttering that particular view in public and instead will voice it in private.And that, in my opinion, is far more dangerous.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250

Bearing in mind that those who self-harm are at much greater risk of suicide, this is not a problem to be taken lightly.For some young people the act of cutting, or otherwise inflicting pain on themselves, is a way of relieving — albeit temporarily — mental pain and torment by converting it into something more visible and tangible.It’s a way of relieving tension and an attempt to clarify a confusing mental swirl into something that is easier to understand in its simplicity. It’s also a way of punishing yourself.So why the sudden, huge, increase in girls taking this path?Psychiatrists commenting on the research blamed a combination of academic stresses and body-image issues triggered by the use of social media.There’s no doubt that social media, which barely existed ten years ago, has, along with all the good stuff, brought with it a whole new set of pressures.Women’s appearances have always been scrutinised, but that unique equation of the selfie generation plus Photoshop plus the sheer variety of ways to propel your image out into the world has created a series of impossible standards.It’s also created a whole generation that is convinced that everything is going brilliantly for everyone else.When teenagers look at their friend’s social media feeds they see apparently perfect lives, bodies, homes and jobs.And then they feel inadequate.There are other pressures: Pressure to do well in exams have amazing friendships and be brilliantly successful. And, for some people, the relief to those pressures is to hurt themselves, which is surely the saddest and one of the most difficult problems any parent can deal with.After all, it’s our natural instinct to protect our children from harm. But what can we do when the harm comes from within themselves?All teenage kids have intensely difficult phases. And the pressures at school can feel unbearable.If someone doesn’t like you, it feels like the end of the world. If you fail an exam you can feel doomed to failure. School feels like it will never end.Our job is to try to help our children get perspective.Despite the downsides of excessive social media being well documented, it seems that most young people would rather end up with mental health problems than give it up. So maybe they need a helping hand.We need to talk more to our kids about the reality of social media — and limit their time on it.And we need to coax them out of their screen-sized comfort zone.One of the best things kids can do is some volunteering.That way they can meet kids from different backgrounds and people with real problems — such as children born with disabilities who are still making the most of their life.Sport is also brilliant for getting kids to enjoy being part of something bigger than their bedroom, and for celebrating their bodies for what they can do rather than what they look like.The big question is, how can we get them to talk about their feelings, instead of engraving them into their skin until they draw blood?Be kind, patient but determined and, most importantly, we need to talk to our children, ask them how they are feeling — and listen to the answers without judgment.If they won’t talk to you, find someone else they can talk to, either a family friend or even a counsellor if you’re worried about self-harm.But the Government also needs to invest more money into care.Less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on children’s mental health, and most of that is on acute care rather than preventative or early intervention services.That needs to change.Most of all, we need to accept that there is a problem and find ways to address it. Because if we don’t, things are going to get much, much worse.SURELY only those with the hardest of hearts could complain about the affection shown by Zara and Mike Tindall, who are frequently photographed kissing, hugging and looking generally happy and totally loved-up.Given they have survived challenging personal losses and have two young children, it’s pretty much a miracle they are so happy.How could anyone wish them anything but well?DID you see the Kardashian and Jenner sisters at Kylie Jenner’s 21st birthday party?What is most striking – other than them all being drop-dead gorgeous, of course – is that they each have totally different body types.I guess what they DO have in common is an unlimited budget for personal trainers and chefs . . . plus the fact that looking this good is their full-time job.His crime was horrific and he deserved to be dealt with.His punishment was to be beheaded and his body crucified and displayed in Mecca.A beheading and crucifixion in this century?There are instances when I do believe that the death penalty is just, but this method is just barbaric.THE latest advice from fertility specialists to women who want to “delay motherhood” is for them to freeze their eggs in their early twenties.At the moment, the vast majority of women who go through the procedure do so in their late thirties – by which time they have little chance of success. But who is going to freeze their eggs in their twenties?I was fortunate to meet the right man in my twenties – and had children once I was married because I wanted to have a family.But plenty of women don’t meet the right partner that early in life, or simply don’t want to have children until they are older.One reason for that is that they want to have a career – and they know babies can seriously damage their chances of promotion or even a pay rise.But the solution is not for women to freeze their eggs.The real solution is a shift in the division of labour between mothers and fathers.So long as the children are not the sole responsibility of just one person in the family, things can work well.If both partners are equally involved, nobody has to totally compromise their life and put their career on hold.As things stand, no wonder women are putting off motherhood. But if more men pulled their weight, maybe women wouldn’t have to worry about freezing their eggs.WHEN you look at photos of the 200 travellers who have descended on the village of Long Ditton in Surrey, you can see why local police sparked fury by telling residents who want to evict them to have empathy instead.The police force tweeted: “Consider for a second how upsetting it would be, being uprooted every few days.”But the photos show piles of rubbish and damaged property.In one, a child is sitting on an adult’s lap while he drives a car around the village green. And I dread to think about the specifics of the toilet situation.What is needed is not empathy but police action.SOME high-profile, wealthy parents – such as Sting, Elton John and Simon Cowell – make a point of saying they won’t leave their fortunes to their children for fear it will ruin their lives.Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp has taken a different tack.She says she will leave her £16million fortune to her two sons . . . IF they get a job.I applaud the sentiment. But if you really want your children to develop a work ethic, rather than relying on inherited income, isn’t the key not to tell your kids – and the whole world – in a national newspaper?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In any other customer facing industry we’d be looking at proper refunds.”And Treasury aide Chris Philp insisted Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had to deliver on plans announced in June to give commuters on Southern a month’s worth of compensation.He said: “No one who has suffered should be paying more next year. People have paid for a service and it’s not been received.”Labour demanded a fare freeze on Sunday – and called for a windfall tax on train operators.Official inflation figures tomorrow are due to show retail prices rose by 3.5 per cent in July. The July figure is taken as the basis for annual fare hikes in January.A 3.5 per cent rise would push up season tickets for between London and Ashford by £188 to £5,567, London and Southampton by £200 to £5,902. A season ticket from Macclesfield to Manchester on troubled Northern Rail would also rise by £90 to £2,663.The hikes come after a summer marked by timetabling chaos and cancelled services across the country.Southern has warned passengers this week they face 34 days of disruption on the Brighton to London mainline from September due to “improvement” works. Fares across the UK have soared by 40 per cent over the past decade.The Department for Transport yesterday said that while further hikes were “unwelcome” they were essential to funding work on the railways. But Tories have urged the Government to follow ex-Chancellor George Osborne – who capped regulated rail fares in 2011.Insiders argue that unions must share part of the blame for soaring ticket prices as around 25p in every £1 spent goes on wages. Labour’s former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis said customer dissatisfaction was running at levels that would “shame” the likes of major supermarkets.He stormed: “Watchdogs Which? say that one in five rail passengers are dissatisfied with their last journey. Imagine that was a supermarket, with one in five dissatisfied with the last food they bought. Passengers shouldn’t be expected to pay more for worse.”After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here is part of the answer.“Either the Government have taken their eye off the ball or they have been too heavily influenced by a small group of companies and have ignored their own.”Migration Watch said that since 1992, the number of ICTs (inter-company transfers) has increased eightfold. In 1997 the Home Office issued around 15,000 to workers and their families.This jumped to 47,000 in 2007 and 58,000 last year.Two types of ICTs can be issued – from long-term staff visas to permits for graduate trainees.Migration Watch’s blast comes just weeks after official figures revealed non-EU immigration pushed net migration to nearly 300,000 in the first full year since the Brexit referendum.Net migration from EU nations fell to just over 100,000 in 2017 – the lowest level in five years.

What we would like to do is introduce a ‘concierge click and collect’ at House of Fraser.“When you go online and say you want to collect goods in-store, you should be able to book a time, book a changing room and book a stylist.“You get that kind of personal shopping service in a Harrods. There’s no reason why it couldn’t be rolled out nationally across House of Fraser.”Sports Direct, which already held an 11 per cent stake, bought House of Fraser outright just hours after it went into administration.It was left on the brink of collapse after the Chinese owner of toy store Hamleys pulled out of a £70million rescue deal.House of Fraser, which its new owner affectionately calls “HoF”, employs 17,000, including 11,500 in-store concession staff.Ashley, who is worth around £3billion, believes the key to securing its future is to introduce more luxury brands.He added that big-hitters such as Gucci, Prada, Stone Island and Mallet footwear were “the biggest thing missing” as House of Fraser ran into the red.Drawing on his experience with designer chain Flannels, which is owned by Sports Direct, he intends to stock House of Fraser with successful “cool brands of the moment”.He said: “We think the biggest and most important thing House of Fraser is missing is luxury brands. We think it will make a big difference.“It is not taking away from House of Fraser, but adding to it.“If you get the right product, it is not on the shelves for long.”Larger House of Fraser stores, such as the one in Birmingham, could see whole floors turned over to Sports Direct or Flannels, Ashley added.Among the stores that could be saved from closure is the Oxford Street flagship in London — if landlords and suppliers can be won over.Ashley admitted that landlords have been “battered and bruised” by a raft of retail tenants seeking rent reductions this year.In a message to them, he said: “Give us a chance and we will try to keep as many open as we can. We are here to get House of Fraser back to where it once was.”However, some analysts are sceptical that the colourful billionaire can pull it off.Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb warned: “It is far from clear if he really knows what he has taken on.”HOUSE OF FRASER lost its way but Ashley wants to take it upmarket with more luxury bestsellers, brands popular with younger customers and a personal shopper service.SPORTS DIRECT’s superstores are full of popular brands, including Lonsdale and Donnay.

It is celebrated religiously throughout the subcontinent country on August 15 every year.This date was when independence came into effect.On August 15, 1947, at the stroke of midnight, India was declared independent from the British Empire, which was also known as the Raj.  It was accountable to London as part of British colonial system that operated for 100 years after the trading organisation, the UK based East India Company, gradually took over with a private army after the native Mughal Empire crumbled.During the Raj, the UK invested hugely in infrastructure such as railways and mines and developed a legal and educational system which helped transform India.But to maintain its rule over the many religions and cultures, Britains colonial chiefs had to spend a fortune on the Indian Army.The Indians were essentially bankrolling the bill to be ruled by another country. Resentment grew towards this status quo because it was felt taxes and other revenue that was raised in the country could be better spent on improving its own citizens lives - many of whom were impoverished.  This spurred the political movement called the Indian National Congress in 1885 which evolved into the independence movement.Among the leaders were Mahatma Gandhi, who became a prominent pro-independence figure - leading millions in his quest for a peaceful solution which won him world respect, especially in Britain among many who realised the violence that could potentially break out. During World War Two 2.5 million Indians fought bravely and competently alongside British ones and the allies, and in return London promised independence. In any case after the war Britain had no longer the money or the popular support to keep India in the empire  and it was granted freedom on August 15. Independence also spelled the end of India as a united subcontinent nation - on paper at least - because it paved the way for what was known as partition, with Pakistan and East Bengal (now Bangladesh) emerging as separate nations.Some 15 million people died in sectarian violence as a result. Seventy-five thousand women were raped and disfigured in the painful and bloodthirsty birth of these countries. It is celebrated with a day off and with great fanfare and colour in what is probably the most spectacular national day in the world.   There are many religious celebrations across India.It is also marked among those who migrated to western countries like Britain."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000426403593.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brit henna tattoo scar friday night dinner quote","story":"Beth Fitzimmons was with eight pals on the Greek island of Zante when they decided to have the words Shalom Jackie inked on them for a laugh last month.But the 18-year-old, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, had an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the black henna, which can contain high levels of toxic chemical paraphenylenediamine (PPD).Doctors reckon shell be left with the words scarred on her forearm for at least six months.They chose the phrase from the popular Channel 4 comedy series because people on holiday kept shouting it and she and her friends found it amusing.She said the group were on their third night out of the holiday when they decided to get the five euro henna tattoo done - but it wasnt until around a week later that it began to itch and feel like a burn.Beth said: We were on a night out but I dont really drink so I was sober when I did it.It was done by a random family in the street. The mum and dad were doing them.We woke up the next day and thought it was hilarious. We sent pictures to our parents and and they were like that better not be permanent.It was absolutely fine until about eight days later then it was so itchy and it felt like it was burning.It was so red. It was all raised up. Now it looks a bit like eczema and is very dry.She went to a pharmacy when she got back to the UK and was told to go to a walk-in centre.Beth, who is taking a gap year after finishing her A-Levels this summer, added: I thought that was a bit extreme so I went to the doctor on the Monday.I said to them that I was probably overreacting but I needed to know if it was going to scar permanently because when I looked it up it said you needed to be treated for chemical burns.I was so worried it would scar me forever.The doctors told me Id had an allergic reaction to it and it would take about six months to go completely.Beth was prescribed a steroid cream and told that due to the chemicals in black henna also being used in hair dyes, she would no longer be able to dye her hair.She added: She [the pharmacist] was very firm on it because she said my body would start attacking whats in the hair dye and that I could actually die.That was the worst thing for me - not being able to dye my hair.Beth says everyone was shouting the phrase made popular by the character Jim on the show, which is about two brothers who return home for dinner with their parents every Friday night.Beth said: I love the show - its hilarious. Friday Night Dinner seems to be the thing that young people are obsessed with at the moment.It was everywhere in Zante. People would shout different lines back at each other.Warning others against the dangers, Beth said: I would 100 per cent say do not get black henna.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire.

But I can tell some of them are thinking ‘are you for real?’“I feel like a bit of a tink turning up to job interviews wearing a tracksuit, T-shirt and trainers — but I would look ridiculous if I was wearing smart clothes and my big white trainers.”David added: “It’s been a total nightmare and very embarrassing. I feel like I have tried everywhere in Scotland but nobody does my size.“And I get people making fun of me when I’m at the bus stop or walking down the street people say ‘Wow. look at him. Are those boats on your feet?’. Others call me ‘banana feet’.It’s demoralising. I think I’d have a job if I had shoes. It brings me down and it’s pretty hurtful.“I just want to get back to work. I can’t be the only person in the UK with size 19 feet.”David, who is 6ft 2in tall and weighs in at 24 stone, has had big feet since he was youngster.When he left school he was a size 16. But he could find shoes that fitted him at the time and worked in retail, cleaning and security jobs through his 20s.But since then his feet have grown three sizes and are almost 12in long and 7in wide. David says he has been turned down by at least ten employers since he last worked.His worried girlfriend Annie Jones, 32, said she hopes he can resolve the situation and land a job.Annie said: “People laugh at him. They point at him and call him names. It’s mean when they call him “clown shoes” and it gets him down.I hope he can get back to work. It would mean a lot to him.”Do you have bigger feet?

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is usually very well rated by the most Customers (any nationality).Our daily entertainment includes activities like GAP, games, power dance, latin dance, laugh therapy, English petanque, etc. and our night entertainment includes shows, live music, contests, cabaret, etc.And another guest, from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, took to the site to allege that Spaniards at the hotel gave English guests filthy looks.Lovely clean hotel, pricey bar for drinks, terrible for the Spanish giving you filthy looks soon as they realise your English (sic)!Another woman wrote: It was all in Spanish, I know it is in Spain but everything was catered for the Spanish, the food, the music.If you where an OAP and Spanish you would have had a ball, hotels I know cater for all as it is for tourists all over the world not just Spanish (sic).Other tourists moaned the Spanish were rude and the entertainment was in Spanish.However, the majority of comments on the site are positive.And in response to one unhappy guest, the manager of Hotel Poseidon Playa wrote: We have 25 international channels in our TV, not just one in English and the rest in Spanish.Yes, we have some traditional Spanish food in our menu, as an extra plate, but we also have different meats, fish, rices, vegetables, pies, pasta, paella.... Also Shepherds Pie and Yorkshire Pudding on some days, so plenty of international choice.For breakfast you will find, bacon, sausages, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, fresh fruits, pastries, yougurts, pancakes, omelletes... A choice for everyone. We also have tea and a selection of infusions.During the month of March, we have catered a lot of other nationalities, not just Spanish, and in every department there is more than two workers that speak very fluent English.Freda, who suffers from mobility issues, had saved up her pension for the £1,133 Thomas Cook trip with her 61-year-old pal.A spokesman for the holiday operator said: Due to a system error Ms Jackson was not informed of a change to her flights until six days before departure.We are very sorry for the inconvenience this caused and are investigating to make sure it doesn’t happen again.We have offered Ms Jackson and her travel companion a gesture of goodwill to try and put things right which we hope she will accept."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-ben-stokes-stkes_4388924.jpg?20180813153357 ","title":"ben stokes trial jury to start deliberating verdict in case of england cricketer","story":"Ali is then said to have delivered a glancing blow to the shoulder of one of the gay men.Stokes is accused of knocking Ali to the floor and knocking him unconscious, with a video apparently showing Mr Hales kicking his head and stamping on him.Alex Hales was interviewed by police but never arrested or charged.Ali suffered a fractured eye socket in the incident and has said he still suffers problems with his vision.He was also left with swelling on his eye, a laceration above his eyebrow, a cracked tooth and a bruise behind his ear.

The good news is that spending quality time with the ones you love doesn’t have to be expensive. Here are some suggestions for activities the family will love without costing the Earth… 1. Pimp an old bike A bike ride is a fantastic way to spend time with the kids, and it can be combined with a low-cost picnic for an even nicer day. Anyone with small people in their lives will vouch for the fact that they don’t stay small for long. The advantage? They quickly outgrow their bikes, meaning there’s likely to be plenty of friends and family with once-loved models gathering dust in the garage or shed.  If your child doesn’t have a bike, speak to friends, neighbours – or check out Freecycle . Once you’ve got your hands on some pre-loved wheels, take your bike to Halfords for a Free Bike Check . In-store experts will check tyre pressure, brakes and gears. If they spot anything that needs attention, they can fix it too. If you\u0027d prefer to go new than second hand, Halfords currently has a range of kids\u0027 bikes at up to 30% off - like the BMX-style Apollo Ace Kids\u0027 Bike, \u0026pound63 (save \u0026pound27), which is suitable for ages three to 11 - depending on the model.  2. Get them growing   Kids love getting their hands dirty – and if you have a garden or access to an allotment then you can join forces to tackle the weeds and grow some wonderful flowers, fruit and vegetables. Reward the littl’un who pulls up the most weeds, hold a sunflower growing competition, or see who can coax the biggest marrow from the soil. You can encourage kids to help by letting them choose their own plants: fruits like strawberries and tomatoes are also fun and reasonably simple to grow – they also have a tasty reward at the end! 3. Make some real lemonade  Making real lemonade is simple to do, inexpensive and unbeatable on a warm day. Gather some lemons, sugar and water (you’ll need roughly 140g of caster sugar and 1 litre of water for every three lemons).  Once it\u0027s ready, enjoy in the shade of the Halfords 250 Fully Waterproof Gazebo, \u0026pound39 (save \u0026pound11) - perfect for covering a lemonade stand or an outdoor play area. 4. Go hunting for bats   Bats are glorious creatures, and the summer months are a good time to get out and spot them. As the sun sets you can usually spot these flying mammals darting about in the sky. Their erratic flight patterns mean they\u0027re easy to distinguish from birds, and keeping an eye out for them is a great way to spend an evening. You can also head to your local park with an evening picnic – use the Halfords Coolbag Trolley , \u0026pound15 (half price), to get your food there with minimal carrying effort. As it gets dark, lie back on a Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket,\u0026pound10 (half price), and spot the sonar-equipped mosquito-munchers in action.  Or, if you\u0027re looking to go further afield, why not take the Urban Escape 6 Person Vis A Vis Tent along and make it an overnight trip. It\u0027s currently half price at just \u0026pound125. Take some facts about bats with you too, so the little ones will learn about one of nature\u0027s most misunderstood creatures. For example, bats can – apparently – consume up to 1,200 mosquitos per hour and will sometimes eat their own bodyweight in insects in a single night. You\u0027ll find loads of information and details about organised Bat Walks on the Bat Conservation Trust\u0027s website. 5. Get them stargazing Those summer nights are ideal for checking out the cosmos. The lack of clouds means uninterrupted views of the universe and the hot weather means you\u0027ll get a nice warm evening to gaze into space. You don\u0027t need special equipment for basic stargazing. Apps for your phone will tell you what\u0027s visible, and guide you to interesting stars and planets, as well as giving you the names of constellations. The Moon often looks stunning, and it\u0027s also possible to spot Jupiter and Saturn in the night sky using the naked eye. If you have a decent pair of binoculars you can also spot nebulae and get a great view of our solar system. The Moon, in particular, is a great thing to examine with binoculars.  An Urban Escape King Size Moon Chair , \u0026pound30 (half price), is the perfect spot (with the perfect name) for checking out the cosmos. If you get the bug, check out your local stargazing club. Often you\u0027d be expected to take your own telescope but many would be thrilled to let you experience the night sky through their equipment – check the internet and don\u0027t be afraid to fire off an email. 6. Watch a movie in the moonlight   Across the country there are multiple places to catch a movie in the great outdoors. Search hard enough and you might even find free outdoor movies near you. Taking in a movie on the big screen outdoors can be a great way to spend time with the family. Pack yourselves a nice supper in the Summerhouse Seville 4 Person Wicker Picnic Basket, \u0026pound69.99 - and don’t forget to include the popcorn! 7. Take a low-cost road trip "},{"url":null,"title":"inside time capsule home left","story":"Inside \u0027time capsule\u0027 home left abandoned and untouched for over 20 years as nature reclaims stone cottageAs the stone cottage in west Cornwall, crumbles away, nature has reclaimed the former family home, with foliage crawling through cracked windows and broken doorsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByGreg Martin19:31, 13 AUG 2018NewsThese captivating images show the inside of a \u0027time capsule\u0027 home, left abandoned and untouched for 20 years.As the stone cottage in west Cornwall crumbles away, nature has reclaimed the former home, with foliage crawling through cracked windows and broken doors.Tea cups and crockery are still on display on a kitchen dresser and the cupboards are stocked with rusty tins of food.Dusty books are left opened on the page last read and clothes, now covered in cobwebs, still hang from coat hangers.No one in the area knows what happened to the owner, but everyone agrees he left after his wife died, reports Cornwall Live.

The Labour admitted he was present at a wreath-laying ceremony during a visit to the Palestinian Martyrs’ Cemetery in Tunisia in 2014. But he said he does not “think” he was involved in the ceremony, and denied he was there to pay respects to terror suspects. Mr Corbyn faced criticism after photographs emerged which appeared to show him posing with a wreath near the graves of senior members of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), who were accused of founding Black September - the terror group who masterminded the attack.  A source close to Mr Corbyn said he had visited the cemetery pay respects to the 47 victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) offices in Tunis, which is marked with a stone memorial. But pictures appear to show Mr Corbyn around 15 feet away near the graves of PLO second-in-command Salah Khalaf and Atef Bseiso, the group’s intelligence chief. Both men were accused of being involved in planning the Munich massacre. Israeli secret service Mossad was accused of gunning downthe two men - Khalaf in Tunis in 1991 and Bseiso in Paris in 1992 Asked about the visit last night, Mr Corbyn said: “A wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended conference to those that were killed in Paris in 1992. I was present when it was laid. I don\u0027t think I was actually involved in it. I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it. You cannot pursue peace by a cycle of violence. The only way you pursue peace is a cycle of dialogue. Mr Netanyahu wrote on Twitter: “The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorist who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone - left, right and everything in between.

The fragrant wife of convicted perjurer and former Tory deputy chairman Sir Jeffrey is still beloved, three decades later, for bringing a cup of tea to the press pack gathered outside their Cambridgeshire vicarage during one of her husband\u0027s many scandals. That someone hounded and pursued by the forces of Fleet Street should be so hospitable was considered remarkable, even heroic. It bought her considerable goodwill, not just because a small village in Cambridgeshire is bereft of places to buy tea but also because, when on a job miles from anywhere, bored and stood outside in all weathers, it is a civilising pleasure to drink from china rather than Styrofoam. It humanises those on all sides - if hunter and hunted both drink tea, they think the other can\u0027t be all bad. It is a moment of peace and acknowledgement of the other\u0027s tribulations, like Christmas Day football between enemies in World War One. It doesn\u0027t end the war, but it\u0027s a nice thought.  In 2007, footballer Teddy Sheringham performed the same feat when his then-girlfriend Danielle Lloyd was in the Celebrity Big Brother house and embroiled in a race row with Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty.  Only he did it half-naked.   And so it was that this weekend former Foreign Secretary and habitual-utterer-of-nasty-things Boris Johnson \u0027did a Mary\u0027, as it is known by some, and produced a tray of tea for the photographers gathered outside his country home in Oxfordshire.  There is a lot that can be gleaned from a person\u0027s tea habits, and even more from a tray produced for others. While gazing enviously at Teddy\u0027s abdomen, you will I am sure have noticed he carried a set of matching mugs, minimalist aluminium sugar caddy, and a 2-pint bottle of semi-skimmed milk, on a pleasingly biscuit-coloured wooden tray. All very stripped-down and simple. You get the impression this is a man who does not like mess, and treats strangers with the same high standards he expects in his own life. Two pints tells you he lives alone, and frugally. The tray says his kitchen is pristine, and his fingernails clean.  I\u0027m not sure what Mary\u0027s tea tray looked like - but there are rumours it involved proper cups with saucers. AND BISCUITS.  Boris did not do that. In fact, Boris could not have made more of a cock-up of it if he tried.  The tray contains a hotch-potch of thick clay mugs. One came free with an Easter egg. One looks like it usually has toothbrushes in it. Another bears a corporate logo, and one appears to be from a Battersea Power Station sponsorship programme.  They are, in short, the mugs you make the staff drink from. Mugs that don\u0027t matter.  And no sugar bowl for the snappers. No. A half-open packet of granulated, no doubt with a used spoon wedged in it.  This is a tray that screams YOU\u0027RE ALL PEASANTS, NOW SAY THANK YOU.   And bear in mind, this is the fellow\u0027s second home. He\u0027s a multi-millionaire. There\u0027s bound to be nice mugs and a milk jug in that farmhouse somewhere, he just hasn\u0027t bothered to produce them. The milk is truly boggling. The man has four children and a wife. The children are grown up, but even if they weren\u0027t at home there\u0027s a minimum of two adults there for the whole weekend, and possibly friends and political advisers visiting. A single pint of milk wouldn\u0027t last an afternoon, so anyone sane would buy a 4-pinter on the trip down from London. Which leads me to the uncomfortable conclusion that Boris is either so stupid he bought several, more expensive 1-pint bottles, or that he keeps an old 1-pinter to use as a milk jug. And that\u0027s just skanky.  He is the antithesis of Teddy Sheringham. This is a tea boy who leaves you wondering whether the mugs were washed first, and what in. His fingernails, were they to be inspected, would almost certainly contain traces of the past week\u0027s bogeys. Boris did admirably in refusing to answer questions, and declaring himself on a humanitarian mission because you have been here all day and you\u0027ve been incredibly patient. But if the purpose of his jaunt down the garden path was to buy goodwill, it failed for three simple reasons.  The first is that tea is fundamentally about good manners. The same rituals and purpose apply whether in a Japanese tea ceremony or a truckers\u0027 roadside caff. Boris\u0027 tray displays an impolite lack of consideration, and would be looked at aghast were he to offer such a thing at an official reception, to his in-laws, or to Theresa May.  But seeing as Boris is in his current disciplinary hate-crime pickle because he likened veiled Muslim women to letterboxes, manners are presumably something he lacks on a grand scale.  The second is that, if this tray is really the best he could muster, he must surely have seen that it needed adornment of some kind. Half a packet of Digestives, perhaps, or a handful of Penguins. Anything. Instead, it\u0027s as graceless as his writing. And third is the basic rule that anyone volunteering for a tea run is usually doing it to be nice - to repay an earlier run done by a colleague, to suck up to someone, or to apologise for past wrongs.  In Boris\u0027 case, he\u0027s doing it to pretend to be nice. A bit like when he and Gideon Osborne sat down with some Transport for London workers in hi-vis jackets, and tried for a photo that didn\u0027t make them look like Buller boys talking to daddy\u0027s horse valet.   In short, the best that Boris could do, when caught in a jam of his own making and confronted by journalists, was to attempt deflection with a half-hearted tea round that did little more than belittle the people he delivered it to. The proof is in the pudding with these things, and those journalists will no sooner give him an easier ride tomorrow than he will deliver them a tea pot and the family china.  Not just because since Boris\u0027 column last week there has been an increase in reported hate incidents against women wearing a face veil, but because journalists know and loathe Boris of old.  He\u0027s been fired for making up quotes from his own godfather, promised to use journalistic means to track down the address of someone a mate wanted beaten up, and has not only used his pen to foment racism but boasted of the \u0026pound250,000 he is reportedly paid for doing it.

Simon Meanwell was brought back to life by medical staff after being placed on pioneering cool blanket.  The tot, who is now aged six-months, stopped breathing 90 minutes after being born, but was saved by the medical equivalent of being refrigerated. As a way of showing their gratitude his parents, James and Helen, are raising money for the facilities and teams that saved their little boy. It initially took three attempts at resuscitation for Simon\u0027s tiny lungs to work on their own again. But it was a little known therapy designed to cool the body temperature of babies down which stopped him having seizures, saved his life, and boosted his chances of growing up without disabilities.  Simon was born at Peterborough Hospital and everything initially seemed to go smoothly. But soon Mr and Mrs Meanwell\u0027s newborn son stopped breathing and medics rushed to give him CPR. Mr Meanwell, 41 and from Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, said: He was absolutely fine when he was born but then he stopped breathing. It took six minutes to get his heart started. Simon\u0027s condition was so serious he needed to be transferred to the nearest specialist centre, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Norwich. Mr Meanwell, who works at a company which imports quad bikes, said: The vehicle is basically a NICU in the back of an ambulance. As soon as they had resuscitated him they started what they call a cooling process, which lasts for 72 hours. The treatment, known as cooling therapy, is relatively new and is used on babies who are seriously deprived of oxygen during or shortly after birth to help prevent brain injury.  It involves putting the baby on a waterproof blanket which contains cool circulating water to lower the body temperature to 33C for 72 hours, before allowing it to return to normal. Until 2014 there was no approved treatment to help reduce the aftershocks of low oxygen at birth but researchers think the therapy works by slowing the production of harmful substances in the brain and the rate of brain cell death. The Meanwells stayed at the N\u0026ampN for two weeks, where they described the care and support as outstanding, before being allowed back to Peterborough. In total Simon was in hospital for a month. Mr Meanwell said: The first couple of days we were just totally in shock. It was very upsetting.

Beth Fitzsimmons was on the Greek island of Zante when she and eight pals decided to get the words \u0027shalom Jackie\u0027 written on their arms. But the henna tattoo - which cost five euros - left her with a burning sensation on her arms, and could now take six months to heal. The 19-year-old had an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the black henna, which can contain high levels of toxic chemical paraphenylenediamine (PPD). She chose the words \u0027shalom Jackie\u0027 because people on the holiday kept shouting it and she and her friends found it amusing.  Despite worrying her parents, Beth says nothing was wrong with the tattoo until the eight day, when it started itching and she had a burning sensation. Beth, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: It was one of those phrases that people were just shouting. My friends and I thought it was really funny so on the third night of the holiday after going out we decided to get it done. We were on a night out but I don\u0027t really drink so I was sober when I did it.  It was done by a random family in the street. The mum and dad were doing them. We woke up the next day and thought it was hilarious. We sent pictures to our parents and and they were like \u0027that better not be permanent\u0027. It was absolutely fine until about eight days later then it was so itchy and it felt like it was burning. It was so red. It was all raised up. Now it looks a bit like eczema and is very dry.  I went to the pharmacy about a week after I got back home and they didn\u0027t have a clue. That was on a Thursday and they said if it was still there on Sunday go to the walk-in centre. I thought that was a bit extreme so I went to the doctor on the Monday. I said to them that I was probably overreacting but I needed to know if it was going to scar permanently because when I looked it up it said you needed to be treated for chemical burns. I was so worried it would scar me forever. The para-phenylenediamine chemical in black henna is also used in hair dyes and not in brown or other coloured henna. It can cause blistering of the skin, painful burns and can lead to scarring as well as leaving someone with a lifelong sensitivity to it which increases the risk of severe allergic reaction when using hair dyes in the future. When she returned to the pharmacist to collect her prescription, Beth was warned because of the chemical she would no longer be able to dye her hair.

The pensioner, who suffers from mobility issues, says her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. Retired care assistant Freda said: The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude. One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?  Freda had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says the travel operator Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Grandmother-of-six Freda and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Freda, who lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, said: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish.  My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claims Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday.  She said there were no reps on the holiday who they could complain to about the trip - so instead Ms Jackson submitted a letter of complaint to Thomas Cook. Thomas Cook bosses initially offered Freda and her friend a \u0026pound75 holiday voucher as compensation for the \u0027disappointing\u0027 trip abroad. But after declining the initial \u0027goodwill gesture\u0027 made by the travel company, they made an improved offer of \u0026pound566 to be split between Freda and her friend.

The 47-year-old has suffered from a number of health issues, and had tests after suffering what was thought to be a chest infection in December. But it turned out to be lung cancer and Andy quickly underwent an aggressive course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, reports Coventry Live . Though recently it was discovered that the cancer had left Andy\u0027s lung, it had sadly spread to his liver and spine - and he was given just weeks to live. Sharon and Andy were planning on getting married next year, when Andy was better. But with the tragic news, they have had to have a rethink.

We were going to get married next year when Andy was better, but that changed when he was given about two months to live. So we\u0027re trying to raise money now to make the day extra special, to hire a DJ, get some flowers, that sort of thing. We have also set up a fundraiser for our reception and honeymoon in the UK. Sharon set up a fundraiser on Facebook, with the hope of raising \u0026pound1,000. Remarkably, in just seven days, she has raised \u0026pound2,090.

Freda Jackson, 81, said the Hotel Poseidon Playa was teeming with rude Spanish guests, who should \u0027go somewhere else for their holidays\u0027. She claimed the entertainment at the venue - located on the outskirts of the city in eastern Spain - was all focused and catered for the Spanish. She even said she cried at the end of her two-week trip with a pal, after facing other issues including a last-minute change of flight and being initially placed on the 14th floor despite mobility issues. But remarkably, Freda is not the first British guest to have complained about native Spaniards at the hotel - with one claiming \u0027they invaded\u0027 the venue. While most reviews of the Poseidon Playa are positive, some unhappy holidaymakers have previously hit out at Spanish families for \u0027taking over\u0027.  Writing on Tripadvisor earlier this year, one woman, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, claimed she had endured the worst holiday she\u0027d ever had. She described how she couldn\u0027t get on the dance floor due to Spanish families. No complaints of staff or the hotel, just the very rude ignorant pushy Spanish that invaded the hotel, she wrote. We did read up on reviews that said there were few Spanish , but not so many they overtook the hotel. She added: Evening entertainment 99% Spanish, couldn\u0027t get on dance for them :( 99% Spanish music, they all grouped together with the chairs and tables, we didn\u0027t dare move as they would have wiped ours too (sic). Responding to the woman on the site, the hotel replied: Thank you for the time you used to write your review and for your words about our hotel and staff. We regret that our entertainment was not to your liking. It is usually very well rated by the most Customers (any nationality).  Our daily entertainment includes activities like GAP, games, power dance, latin dance, laugh therapy, English petanque, etc. and our night entertainment includes shows, live music, contests, cabaret, etc. Another guest, from Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland, took to Tripadvisor to allege that Spaniards at the hotel gave English guests filthy looks. Lovely clean hotel, pricey bar for drinks, terrible for the Spanish giving you filthy looks soon as they realise your English (sic)! wrote the woman. She added that the lifts kept breaking down, which is unsurprising the amount of Spanish and other foreigners that squeeze in. And she claimed the entertainment was a complete joke unless you\u0027re Spanish, saying: Not one word in English. A third holidaymaker echoed her comments about the entertainment, writing: It was all in Spanish, I know it is in Spain but everything was catered for the Spanish, the food, the music. The tourist added: If you where an OAP and Spanish you would have had a ball, hotels I know cater for all as it is for tourists all over the world not just Spanish (sic). Thomas Cook offered compensation to Freda and her friend due to a last-minute change of flight - not because of the gran\u0027s allegations about Spanish holidaymakers. A spokesman for the holiday operator said: “Due to a system error Ms Jackson was not informed of a change to her flights until six days before departure. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this caused and are investigating to make sure it doesn’t happen again. We have offered Ms Jackson and her travel companion a gesture of goodwill to try and put things right which we hope she will accept.” Some others claimed Spanish guests were all very rude - with one advising potential British holidaymakers: Don\u0027t go if you\u0027re not Spanish. Another, from Manchester, wrote: We were the only English in the hotel. However, the majority of the reviews for the hotel on the site are positive, with guests praising its helpful staff, perfect location and excellent food. One happy customer, from Leiceseter, wrote: Great food very clean and staff just lovely. Fantastic position for the beach. She added: Would go back in a heartbeat. Another said: Great hotel and service fantastic. In a response to the unhappy guest from Manchester, the Poseidon Playa\u0027s manager pointed out that the hotel caters for people of all nationalities. The manager wrote: We have 25 international channels in our TV, not just one in English and the rest in spanish. They added: Yes, we have some traditional spanish food in our menu, as an extra plate, but we also have diferent meats, fish, rices, vegetables, pies, pasta, paella.... Also shepards pie and yorkshire pudding on some days, so plenty of international choice (sic).  For breakfast you will find, bacon, sausages, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, fresh fruits, pastries, yougurts, pancakes, omelletes... A choice for every one. We also have tea and a selection of infusions. The manager also said: During the month of March, we have catered a lot of other nationalities, not just Spanish, and in every department there is more than two workers that speak very fluent English. We earlier reported how Freda, who lives in Blackburn, Lancashire, has demanded a full refund or a free trip following her holiday. The retired care assistant, who struggles with mobility, alleged: The hotel was full of Spanish holidaymakers and they really got on our nerves because they were just so rude. One evening a Spanish guy nearly knocked me flying and he just walked off without even apologising. The entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish - why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays? Freda had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa with a friend in April last year. She claimed travel operator Thomas Cook had recommended the hotel and that, despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope.  The grandmother-of-six and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday - but it apparently turned out to be a disaster. She claimed: I have never complained about a holiday before - but this one was a disaster from start to finish. My friend and I paid for it from our pensions and it was a struggle trying to fund it over 12 months and the holiday was totally ruined - I cried after. We wanted to go somewhere on flat ground and not in the hills because we have mobility issues. To top it off once we got to reception they told us we had been put on the 14th floor, thankfully we were moved to the second floor, and that it was 42 steps down to the hotel\u0027s swimming pool. The pair travelled 1,500 miles from Manchester Airport to Alicante on May 10, after not being notified by Thomas Cook that the dates of their flights had changed. Freda, who has previously visited Greece, Turkey, Portugal and Tenerife, claimed Thomas Cook \u0027mis-sold\u0027 and \u0027ruined\u0027 her dream holiday. She alleged there were no reps on the holiday who they could complain to about the trip - so instead Ms Jackson submitted a letter of complaint to Thomas Cook.

A third of people admit they don\u0027t keep themselves properly hydrated in the heat, despite soaring temperatures over the last couple of months, while a quarter have struggled to increase their intake of fluids over the summer. The research, commissioned by British Summer Fruits, also showed that 51% rarely drink water unless it\u0027s mixed with something else, such as squash.  British Summer Fruits, who supply 95 per cent of berries to UK supermarkets, commissioned the research of 2,000 UK adults and found some go as long as seven days without having a glass of water. Dr Emma Derbyshire, Public Health Nutritionist and spokeswoman for British Summer Fruits, said: “Water is the single most important macronutrient to consume to stay hydrated, especially in this hot weather. “Water is energy, calorie and sugar free so can help you to stay hydrated without providing surpluses of these.” The research also found nine in 10 typically add squash or cordial to sweeten plain water. And just one in 10 opt for water infused with chunks of freshly cut fruit such as berries. Worryingly 23 per cent of the population choose fizzy drinks to stay hydrated. While two thirds never check the calorie count in what they are drinking - in fact, only a fifth check the ingredients of drinks before consuming them.  Almost half believe no added sugar squash is better for you than regular squash. Dr Emma Derbyshire added: “People across the country are becoming more conscious about what they are eating. “However, many are still overlook what they are drinking - and in some instances energy and sugars can tally up. “There are many healthy and delicious ways to beat dehydration. For example, try adding mixed berries to your water. “Adding three to four mixed berries - raspberries, blueberries and strawberries - could help increase your vitamin C consumption. “So, not only does it keep you hydrated, taste great, it also has added health benefits.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside annex horror left full","story":"NewsInside \u0027annex of horror\u0027 left full of needles and rotting food by tenant - but landlord must pay for clean upThe tenant, aged in his 50s, has lived in the den of squalor for five years - but the council says it is the landlords\u0027 responsibility to clean it upShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAlex Richards reporter19:59, 13 AUG 2018NewsPictures show the filthy condition the family found the property in (Image: Devon Live WS)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn annex littered with used needles, urine and rotting food has been deemed so vile even workmen are refusing to go inside.

George Koh, 24, was today convicted of murdering Harry Uzoka .  The two had fallen out after Koh claimed to have slept with the victim\u0027s girlfriend, and Mr Uzoka accused him of being fake. The rivals had arranged to settle the row \u0027face to face\u0027 in Shepherds Bush, West London, on January 11 this year. Mr Uzoka, 25, recruited his flatmate, Adrian Harper, as back-up and the pair arrived armed with a dumbbell bar each.  But Koh was waiting with a knife in each hand accompanied by \u0027big, burly, strong\u0027 pals Merse Dikanda, wielding a \u0027terrifying\u0027 machete, and personal trainer Jonathan Okigbo, both also 24. When the rivals confronted each other, Harry and his friend revealed the dumbbell bars before Koh - seen in the footage wearing a green parka - stated are you mad? and pulled out two knives. Okigbo, wearing a blue jacket, reached over to a black bag held by Dikanda - wearing a black jacket and hood - and pulled out an object with a black handle, stating I want to let this off at you.  Moments later Dikanda pulled out a machete. Harry’s friend fled immediately on sight of the weapons, followed by Harry, who was pursued by Koh and Dikanda, both armed with a machete and knives, and trapped Harry against a vehicle. Okigbo chased after Harry’s flatmate to ensure he would not return.  Harry, who was surrounded by the three men, was stabbed by Koh, three times, with one of the wounds penetrating his chest. He was able to escape, but moments later collapsed in the street as the men walked off in the opposite direction. Police and paramedics were called shortly before 4pm by a member of the public who found Harry collapsed and bleeding in the street. He died shortly over an hour later. After the brutal attack the trio had hid in a doorway, close to the crime, unaware that CCTV had recorded Koh wiping a blade on his jeans. Okigbo meanwhile had removed a distinctive jacket he was wearing.

So when doctors told her she was likely stressed or depressed, the married mum-of-four refused to listen - instead pressing for more tests to find out the cause of her worrying symptoms. Eventually, she discovered the horrifying truth - she had a cancerous tumour the size of a golf ball in her brain that would claim her life within 12 to 18 months. I was experiencing severe, painful headaches that were 24 hours a day, Mel, from Harlow, Essex, told .  I used to wake up at 4am with these bizarre smells. It\u0027s a smell I have never smelt before. It was like a herbal smell that was very unusual. And I had these attacks that got worse and worse. I would have to sit down to get out of them. An oncologist eventually said the attacks were a form of a seizure. I was worried it was an aneurysm. She added that finding out she had a brain tumour was devastating. My mum just fell apart and my sister grabbed hold of me, she said. Since her diagnosis last summer, the 44-year-old mum has put up a stoic fight to prolong her life and has remained upbeat despite an uncertain future.  But she has suffered a heartbreaking setback - a new tumour is growing in a different part of her brain and she will have to pay privately for the treatment she needs. She doesn\u0027t feel she is getting enough answers from medics in the UK, and is frustrated by limited treatment options available on the NHS and the high cost of alternative therapies in the UK and abroad. She said: I was told that the original tumour was shrinking and the cavity was shrinking. Then I had my most recent MRI in June after I had two seizures close together, and there’s a new area of disease developing in a different part of my brain. I’m strong and I’m positive, and I want to beat this. Unfortunately I don’t have hundreds of thousands of pounds to get the treatment I need. For them to say there’s a recurrence already while I am on chemotherapy is worrying. Brain tumours are notoriously difficult to diagnose, as there are more than 120 different types, says Brain Tumour Research. Most develop from glial cells that support the nerve cells of the brain. And they can present themselves with a wide variety of symptoms, depending on which part of the brain is affected. The most common symptoms - usually headaches and/or vomiting/nausea - occur when the growing tumour increases pressure in the skull. The headaches can be severe and persistent, and are often worse in the morning. Other symptoms of intracranial pressure can include:  Visual disturbance Convulsions (fits or faints, particularly for those over 40) Confusion  Other common symptoms can include:   Loss of balance or co-ordination Numbness or weakness on one side of the body Changes in personality Impaired memory or mental ability such as loss of intellect, blurred or double vision, changes in senses including small and hearing, problems with speech, writing or drawing, and problems with averting the eyes upwards  Brain stem symptoms can include lack of co-ordination when walking, double vision, difficulty in swallowing and speaking, and facial weakness such as a one-sided smile or drooping eyelid. Brain Tumour Research says: In order to diagnose the presence of a brain tumour an MRI or CT scan is imperative. If your doctor has failed to satisfy you as to the cause of your symptoms be adamant about getting a referral to a specialist, who should then send you for such a scan. Mel and her family are now trying to raise \u0026pound200,000 to pay for pioneering treatment at a wonder clinic in Germany. She was diagnosed with the aggressive glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumour in June last year after she began feeling unwell. The mum, who has been positive and open about her condition, had started noticing her symptoms in January and soon went to the GP. She said: I kept coming down with illness and I was worried because I was getting heart palpitations and just being sick all the time, with colds. I went to the GP and they said I had a sinus infection and gave me antibiotics, and then I was told I had a chest infection. In March last year it just got worse. She described how she began noticing strange smells, having seizures and experiencing unbearable headaches - that grew more severe. She went to the GP again and was put through a battery of tests, including blood analysis and an ultrasound of her stomach.  For her family, the fact that Mel, who worked as a carer at a retirement home, sought help was a sign that something was very wrong with her. Her sister Nikki Lee, 43, said: Mel isn\u0027t the type to go to the doctor or to the hospital. The fact that she went to the doctor, we knew it had to be something she felt wasn\u0027t right. Despite all the tests, none revealed the tumour inside Mel\u0027s head. The mum said: A nurse told me you have had a lot of tests and nothing is coming up, so it\u0027s probably stress. I told her I am not a high-stress person. I never get stressed, and I wasn\u0027t stressed. I am used to multi-tasking - working 48 hours a week and raising four children - and I am a coper. She added: Another doctor told me it was depression and I said \u0027no\u0027. They put me on antidepressants that would help with the pain of my headaches.  Neither Mel nor her family were satisfied with those diagnoses, so they kept pressing for answers. Mel said: In the end, my mum said \u0027No, I\u0027ve had enough of this\u0027. Her aunt had an aneurysm and she wanted me to be referred to a specialist. She added that her mum wanted her to have a full-body scan. Last June, she went for a CT scan and left not knowing what the results would show or when she would find out. But about 90 minutes later, her doctor rang her and told her to come to his surgery - along with her mother Pauline, 72 - within the hour. Mel said: I thought, \u0027Oh dear, this can\u0027t be good\u0027. We went, and he told us the devastating news that I had a brain tumour the size of a golf ball. She added: I took it well, really.  I asked what\u0027s next and the GP said he would try to get me into a specialist hospital to remove it, but to go to a local hospital if I get worse. The next day I was constantly being sick, so my sister and my mum took me up to the A\u0026ampE. They gave me a full-body scan to see if the cancer was anywhere else in my body, but they said it wasn\u0027t. Three days later, Mel was transferred to a different hospital where she underwent surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible. Surgeons had removed about 85 per cent of it, but there was more bad news the following week when she was given the results. Mel said: My oncology nurse told me, unfortunately, that it was the worst news. It was the worst form [of tumour]. I wanted to hear how we will beat it. They told me I would get six weeks of radiotherapy and then chemotherapy, but there was nothing else to offer. Brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age, but they kill more children and adults under 40 than any other cancer. Yet just one per cent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to brain tumours, according to campaigners.  In the UK, about 16,000 people are diagnosed each year with a brain tumour - or almost 44 people a day. It is estimated that more than 5,000 people lose their lives to a brain tumour die each year. Less than 20 per cent of those diagnosed with a brain tumour survive beyond five years compared with an average of 50 per cent across all cancers. Brain tumours kill more children than leukaemia, more women under 35 than breast cancer and more men under 45 than prostate cancer, according to Brain Tumour Research.  She added: They removed 85 per cent of the tumour, but what’s very frustrating is even that\u0027s a very grey area. It’s all very vague, they\u0027re unable to say for sure how much is left in there. Mel and Nikki have been left frustrated, they say, because no-one can give them definite answers. Nikki said: You’re hit with this devastating diagnosis … you want to know what you can do to get better, but nobody can answer that. Mel has refused to let the diagnosis derail her life. Just four days after she was released from hospital after surgery, she went to an Ed Sheeran gig in Camden, north London. Nikki said: She was just going up to everybody and telling everyone, \u0027I just had brain surgery\u0027 and what her diagnosis was. You think, \u0027Be careful, you just had brain surgery\u0027, but Mel was behaving like she had just had some minor surgery.  Mel added: I was dancing and singing, and I had a great time. You have to get on with things, don\u0027t you? I said, \u0027I am going to go and enjoy myself\u0027. The diagnosis was a devastating blow to Mel\u0027s family, and it has put her and her bus driver husband Simon, 53, under financial duress at the worst possible time. Mel can no longer work as a carer or drive a car due to the tumour, meaning the family are on a single income and Simon has had to work overtime to make ends meet while also caring for his wife. She said: My husband is amazing. He does overtime all the time. He\u0027s very loving and supporting. The couple\u0027s children - sons Dylan, 22, Reece, 20, and Casey, six, and daughter Paige, 16 - don\u0027t know how long their mum will be in their lives. Mel said: It has devastated the whole family. My kids have looked up the disease on the Internet, and they saw how bleak it is. My 16-year-old daughter, she said \u0027we all know, we\u0027ve all looked it up\u0027. She has been stressed and unwell. She also fears her condition is hereditary. She added: It’s something I really worry about all the time. My daughter suffers from migraines.  Mel has suffered from chronic seizures since she underwent surgery to remove the tumour, and can hear an alarm ringing in her ears when one is about to strike. She said: I will say, \u0027Can you hear that noise?\u0027 to the kids and they will tell me no. It feels like when your ears have popped and it sounds really low. So then I know it is coming and I lower myself to the floor. The first time I heard the alarm I didn\u0027t know what was going to happen. I started shaking and my daughter called my husband, and he got me on my side and held me. My body is giving me a warning. Some people detect a burning smell. Mel is still undergoing chemotherapy after another round of radiotherapy, and is paying for treatments at Care Oncology Clinic in Marylebone, central London thanks to the financial support of loved ones. She is focused on leading a healthy lifestyle, hoping it will give her more time. She exercises as much as she can and is following a strict diet of foods that are said to help cancer patients. Related video: Cancer mum given months to live helped by Kate Winslet Medical experts still don\u0027t know what causes brain tumours, as the number of cases and deaths rise by the thousands in Britain every year. Less than 20 per cent survive beyond five years of being diagnosed, and they can affect anyone at any age. Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer, and they kill more children than leukaemia. But just one per cent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to brain tumours, says the charity Brain Tumour Research. It has challenged the government and larger cancer charities to invest more money in research. Dr Kieran Breen, Director of Research at Brain Tumour Research, said: “Bethany’s tumour type, ganglioglioma, tend to be relatively slow-growing, however there is very little conclusive research indicating what causes brain tumours. They can affect anyone at any age, while treatments remain limited, with only two commonly-prescribed chemotherapy drugs available. More research into brain tumours is desperately needed to improve outcomes for patients as the current situation is shocking. Dr Breen added: “Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer. There are 16,000 new cases diagnosed in the UK each year, and incidence is rising. The lack of research investment into this form of cancer means that survival rates lag behind other cancers. For example, around 80 per cent of people with breast cancer survive up to five years after treatment. In brain tumours it’s just 20 per cent.”"},{"url":null,"title":"railways went wrong how fix","story":"NewsWhere the railways went wrong - and how to fix it after months of delay woesChristian Wolmar gives his view on how we get the railways back on track after months and months of delay woesShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByChristian Wolmar22:32, 13 AUG 2018Updated22:40, 13 AUG 2018NewsChristian Wolmar has given his view on how to get the railways back on track (Image: Hulton Archive)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBarely a day goes by without another nightmare rail tale. For the third Sunday running, Northern Rail cancelled dozens of scheduled services as new timetable disruptions persist. That’s the “new” timetable introduced back in May. Fares increases are about to be announced, while customer satisfaction goes the other way. Research has found the rail companies are the least trusted of 13 consumer industries except car dealers, due to problems with train punctuality and reliability. How did an industry once so admired hit the buffers so hard?  For once Margaret Thatcher is not to blame. One of the few good things the ex-PM ever did was NOT privatising the railways. It was, she realised, a bad idea as rail would always need plenty of government subsidy – and was a beloved part of Britain’s heritage. British Rail had got rid of its old-fashioned image by replacing steam trains with sleek InterCity diesel and electric ones that ran at 125mph and were the focus of one of the 1980s’ best ad campaigns: “Let the train take the strain.” Her successor John Major, though, was too weak to stop his right-wingers pushing through plans to sell off the railways. So the idea became a key part of his 1992 manifesto for an election he was not expected to win. When the Tories did in fact retain power he let the ideologues create the most damaging model of privatisation. Major liked the romantic idea of recreating the big four rail companies, based around regions such as Great Western and Southern, which existed from 1923 until nationalisation in 1948.  It was a sensible notion, as it would have created proper rail firms. Instead, he was again pushed by his more ideological ministers into creating a model that involved breaking up the railways into more than 100 organisations and selling as many as possible. Wide expertise was lost in this scorched earth policy. Track and infrastructure were hived off as a separate company, Railtrack. This was subsequently flogged off but went bust and had to be rescued by the Government. Operations were split between 25 firms, many of which also went bust and had to be saved by the state. The engineering department was split into 13 companies. Again several collapsed – most recently Carillion, which had to be rescued by Network Rail. BR’s well-regarded research unit was disbanded and its coachworks mostly closed. We have ever since suffered from the consequences of that disastrous decision, which lies at the root of today’s troubles. Take the recent chaos on timetables. NR draws these up on the basis of demands by the train operators, which have contracts with government to run particular services. However, no one bothered to check if there was enough space on the tracks to accommodate all the extra trains that the operators wanted to run. Moreover, NR produced draft timetable plans late, so operators had no time to prepare for new schedules by, for example, training enough drivers. This was partly because NR’s regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, put the firm under pressure to cut back on the number of timetable staff, which the ORR felt were an unnecessary luxury. To worsen matters, NR failed to deliver some of the track improvements, particularly electrification, needed for the extra trains. This had a knock-on effect, as some of the old diesels used on these lines had been earmarked for other parts of the network. Moreover, in the rush to implement plans, drivers’ rosters were changed arbitrarily, with the result that they were in no mood to volunteer for Sunday shifts. At this point, enter Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. With so many organisations involved, he is the only person with power to ensure co-ordination between them. After all, the Government has a huge say on railways as it owns NR and determines franchise terms. So Grayling could have stopped the massive timetable changes of May 20 – but he did not. Later he said: “I do not run the railways.” Yet he makes many of the decisions that affect them and wants to take credit for improvements. He does not, however, want to take responsibility for things that have gone wrong.

Jordan Holgerson suffered five broken ribs, a lung injury and several abrasions, and can hardly walk after plunging into a river. Footage showed the 16-year-old standing nervously at the edge of the bridge and twice telling her friends \u0027no\u0027 before one pushed her from behind. That friend has since been going out as if nothing happened while Jordan faces a long recovery, a source close to the Holgerson family claims.   The friend who allegedly pushed Jordan - identified by the Sun as 18-year-old Taylor Smith - posed with a friend at the Clark County Fair in a post on Instagram on Saturday, the newspaper reported.  Jordan\u0027s family have been left angered by the social media posts and claim Taylor hasn\u0027t been to visit her since the incident last Tuesday. A family source told the Sun: “Taylor has been going out as if nothing happened.  “She\u0027s been at a pool party and there were pictures of her at the county fair with a friend on Instagram. “Jordan can hardly walk and is in so much pain - she can\u0027t do any of those things. The source added: “She clearly doesn\u0027t care.  The source also claimed that Taylor hasn\u0027t visited Jordan to see if she is OK, and sent a message to say she was sorry.   Jordan\u0027s mum told the Thoroughbred Daily News that the teen is lucky not be paralysed or dead.  Police have not released the names of those involved when Jordan fell 60ft from Moulton Falls and landed in the Lewis River in Yacolt, Washington, in the US.  Officers are still investigating the incident. The video shows Jordan kicking her arms and flailing her arms helplessly in a panic as she falls to the water below. Ashley Mahree, who recorded the video and posted it online, wrote in a YouTube description: “This could have easily taken a life, and I think this girl needs to be held accountable in some way.  She added: The person that pushed her should go to jail. Jordan, who said she blacked out as she fell towards the river, was in a neck brace in hospital following the incident. Someone swam out and rescued her before she was rushed to hospital.

He lunged towards the seven-year-old and yanked her backpack so hard she was lifted off her feet. The youngster\u0027s panicking mother held on to her daughter\u0027s arms in a desperate bid to save her child.  CCTV images from the Neihu district in Taiwanese capital Taipei shows the mum, named in local reports as  Mrs Wu, walking the child home from school when the man strikes.  The suspect, 33-year-old Chou, who worked as a lifeguard at a local swimming pool, later claimed it was a case of \u0027mistaken identity\u0027.  He has now been arrested on kidnapping charges. In the disturbing footage the girl appears to scream and her mother does too, with the parent desperately trying to pull her daughter away. The girl is lifted into the air and the two grown-ups become involved in a game of human tug-of-war. Restaurant staff and a number of passers-by came to the mother\u0027s aid and Chou eventually let go and walked away from the area. Mrs Wu and her daughter were both shaken by the incident but not injured, police from Dahu Precinct said.

Everyone has their own secrets and struggles and sometimes a small, random, act of kindness can mean the world to another human being.  Whether it\u0027s opening a door for someone else, offering some a little bit of spare change or just flashing someone a smile, it can make a big difference.  This is the lesson one woman from Ohio, USA learned after she did something nice for a stranger in Starbucks .   The woman, called Mackenzie, purchased a coffee for the lady behind her in the queue at the popular hot drinks chain. She just thought she was merely doing a sweet thing, but little did she know, she\u0027d made a lasting impact.  Mackenzie revealed all in a Twitter post , which has since gone viral, with 20,000 shares and 80,000 likes.  She said: Yesterday I bought coffee for the lady behind me at Starbucks. Later in the day I found this is my mailbox. Small acts can make a big difference folks, spread some kindness.  The item she found in her mailbox was a thank you letter from the woman she\u0027d bought the drink for, whose name was Nicole. Nicole revealed how she very rarely treats herself to things like Starbucks, but she had been going through a bit of a hard time and was hoping to cheer herself up with a nice drink. Thank you for the coffee! I rarely go to Starbucks and treat myself, but the last couple of months have been a bit of a struggle, she wrote. My father just passed away and he was also my babysitter. My family and my children have had a really hard time.  This morning my babysitter called off sick and I had to take the day off work. I decided to buy my kids breakfast and get myself a coffee with total guilt because I am going to be a stay-at-home-mom for a while. She added that she was not emotionally or financially prepared for this sudden life change and that she cried when she found out what Mackenzie had done for her. But the story gets more interesting. As Nicole headed home, she recognised one of her neighbours as the kind girl from the coffee shop.  It turns out the pair live just down the street from one another, so Nicole decided to take the opportunity to explain just how much the beverage had meant to her. I felt it necessary for you to know that what you did for me was more than just a coffee. It was something that has turned my whole day around, put tears in my eyes and a smile on my face, continued Nicole. She finished the letter by saying she was so grateful. Lots of people loved the tweet, with many commenting that they thought it was so sweet and thoughtful.

British UN envoy Mark Griffith, speaking in the wake of dozens of civilians being killed in a bus blast, warned of “massive humanitarian suffering” if the bloodshed continues.  He said: “A failed state in Yemen has extraordinary consequences for the region, and the wider region, and beyond. And it’s not that inconceivable that could happen. We have to act now. “We also need to act now because in my judgment the war in Yemen will get more complicated the longer it goes on. “There will be more international interest and polarisation in terms of the parties, it will fragment further, it will be more difficult to resolve - even than it is now.”  He added: “My worry about Yemen is that if we left it and it wasn’t resolved, we could look at Syria-plus in the years to come.” The bodies of about 40 children were among scores killed in an airstrike in Saada province, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. The UK Government faces calls to cease selling arms and providing military advice to Saudi Arabia, which leads a coalition that carried out the strike. Iran is supporting Houthi rebels who are being hammered from the air by the Saudi-led coalition in one of the Middle East’s most brutal proxy wars in decades. According to the UN the youngsters had been at a summer camp when the bus was struck on Thursday, with most of the dead between 10 and 13 years old.

We have asked the question and spoken to the club and I believe there is an agreement there but there is nothing agreed with him yet.”Ayr striker Shankland, who has started the season in scintillating form with nine goals in five games, has been linked with a move to Dundee in recent weeks.It was reported on Thursday that the newly-promoted Championship club had rejected a bid from an English side for their striker, but McCann, who has made it clear he is keen to add to his attacking options, played down his interest.“It’s really unfair to comment on any players I am after,” he said. “What I would say is that I have been in the market and been actively trying to get players.“Some have come close and fallen through, others not.“Lawrence is a very talented player.“I know him from my time at Dunfermline and have no doubt he could come to a club like Dundee and do very well, especially in the Premiership.“But as it stands there is nothing happening.”He added: “We tried to do some business on Thursday, it didn’t quite happen but we will continue working on that.”Dundee \u0026#8216agree deal\u0026#8217 for English attacker\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss neil mccann delight at deacon return saying he could be massive","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann is delighted to see “a player who could be really massive for us this year” has returned to training.Winger Roarie Deacon is yet to feature for the Dark Blues at all since the final day of last season after picking up an ankle injury in the 1-0 defeat to Partick Thistle.At the time, the injury didn’t seem too serious but eventually required surgery and has kept Deacon out of action for the entirety of pre-season and the beginning of the campaign.Last week, though, he posted photos on social media of his return to training and his boss was delighted to see the former Arsenal kid back in action.Neil said: “I was really delighted to see him back.“I was sick for Deacon because he got himself into great shape last year and he was so looking forward to hitting the ground running in pre- season but then he picked up a really innocuous injury against Partick.“He’s back running and I’m delighted with that because he’s a player that could be really massive for us this year.”Deacon remains a few weeks away from a return.When he does become available once more for selection, Neil admits he’ll have welcome decisions to make between his players.Something central midfielder Lewis Spence has given him thanks to his form of late.“We want to have decisions to make all over the place,” Neil added.“I thought Lewis’ display was brilliant last week. Maybe he just reinforced why I brought him to the club.

missed the Betfred Cup games against Peterhead and Brechin.He was expected to be fit for the Premiership opener at St Mirren last weekend but suffered a reaction to the injury on the eve of the game in Paisley.It’s unclear yet just how long that will keep the central midfielder out for but he is a big doubt for today’s home clash with the Dons.Despite falling to a 2-1 defeat to the Buddies, the Dark Blues midfield didn’t miss Kamara’s presence too much with Lewis Spence an able deputy with Kharl Madianga, Elton Ngwatala and Paul McGowan ahead of him also performing well.And those four are expected to continue today from the start.Meanwhile, the English transfer window shutting yesterday evening was good news for Dundee fans with Kamara and Steven Caulker still at the club.Kamara had been linked with a move to newly- promoted Premier League side Wolves and Championship Swansea.Loan moves are still available to Football League clubs but the Dark Blues would be unlikely to accept a loan-to-buy deal with the 22-year-old’s contract expiring at the end of the season.Both Celtic and Rangers had been credited with interest in the midfielder and they have till the end of the month to

Laszlo faces some key selection decisions as he tries to get his team back to winning ways at Queen of the South today.After an opening day league defeat that saw three goals conceded in the second half against Dunfermline last week, his desire to make changes is obvious.However, a number of factors, not least fitness, will come into play before he finalises his line-up.Stewart Murdoch could return to the defence if he’s recovered from the swollen knee that forced him to sit out the Pars clash and the recent Betfred Cup trip to Elgin.And if he’s come through training this week without any reaction to the knock that’s sidelined him since last month’s defeat at Ross County, full-back Callum Booth will also return to the squad.After almost a month out, though, it may be the best he can hope for is a place on the bench.And the fact today sees United’s first outing of the campaign on a synthetic surface could be a factor in whether or not the pair are involved.Whoever he decides, or is able to use, Csaba will be looking for much better this time round.While injuries have ruled out various key players in the games so far, he believes those taking their places should be doing so with the aim of hanging on to them even if everyone is fit.“I have said to the team you cannot wait for Fraser Fyvie or Stewart Murdoch or Callum Booth or Billy King,” he said.“You should not just be

\u0026pound100,000.Wardlaw Mausoleum in Kirkhill \u0026ndash resting place of various Lovat Fraser family members \u0026ndash is becoming a must-stop location for fans of the historical time travel Outlander book and TV series.The A-listed building has also in the spotlight in recent months after forensic experts carried out tests on remains contained in a coffin in the crypt. Initially thought to be those of a notorious clan chief nicknamed the Old Fox, they were discovered to be those of a young woman plus four others.Previously, the mausoleum and burial ground drew in a few hundred people each year but last year numbers were between 2000 and 2500 - although it could be higher as not all visitors are recorded.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the burial ground is owned by Highland Council, the 17th century building is owned by the voluntary-run Wardlaw Mausoleum Trust which faces a constant challenge regarding its maintenance.Trust member Erik Lundberg said it was a technically-challenging task to carry out appropriate upkeep and repairs to the building given its age and construction.There was a problem with persistent moisture, for example, caused by an adjoining burial area having a higher ground level than the mausoleum.\"The trust was set up in the early 1990s to take over the ownership and eventual restoration of the mausoleum and that was done in 1998,\" Mt Lundberg said.\"The only income the trust gets is from donations from visitors. When you don\u0026rsquot get as many visitors as you would like especially up until recent years, you don\u0026rsquot really have the funds to maintain the building as you would like.\"He explained that the building should undergo lime rendering to the outside and lime plastering to the inside plus coats of lime wash about every five years. But it is now 20 years since such work was carried out.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"There should be a rolling programme of things to keep a building in good order especially if it is historical,\" he said.\"But with a lack of funds we have only been able to do simple things. There is a backlog of things which need to be done.\"The trust is raising the mausoleum\u0027 profile online and via social media thanks to the volunteer efforts of Mr Lundberg\u0027 student daughter who studies away from home.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut Mr Lundberg believes much more could be done with the development of the website and an app.\"We really need to have better interpretation of the building,\" he said. \"At Culloden Battlefield, they have got display panels and we would like something similar for the mausoleum.\"He estimated the cost of renovation and improved interpretation would come to about \u0026pound100,000.\"It is going to need a serious fundraising exercise,\" he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe welcomed the recent award of \u0026pound36,000 from Highland Council for work in the graveyard including urgent repairs to structures such as perimeter walls and gravestones.It also includes the removal of several trees including six dead elms.

September, people can take on the month-long trek, with all money raised going towards supporting children in hospital.Participants are asked to sign up online for the challenge through the Archie’s Challenge website.Steps are tracked using either a pedometer, Fitbit or similar piece of equipment.The challenge will see a 175-mile section of the Great Wall of China taken on, as the entire wall is more than 13,000 miles long.In reality it is not possible to walk the entire length, as much of it is in ruins, but it’s estimated to take around 177 days to complete in its entirety.To complete the section, people will be asked to walk a minimum of 13,700 steps per day.While taking part, people are also encouraged to raise money for the children’s charity.The person who raises the most money at the end of the challenge will win a trip to China, so that they can walk a section of the wall in person.Other prizes up for grabs include trophies, a certificate, t-shirts and a goodie bag, depending on how much money is raised.Last year’s winner Colleen Hutchison raised £1191.21.She said: “When I set up the online fundraiser I didn’t expect to raise the amount I did.“I still can’t quite believe I

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Wages were 45p/hour and the telephone bill was £32.\u0026#8217Mrs Coats reflected on those early days: \u0026#8216I  could type, so I was asked to be the association secretary,\u0026#8217 she recalled modestly.The truth is, though, that her passion held Earra Gael together for decades with the help of many different volunteers in the shop.She continued: \u0026#8216Earra Gael is really a community. We have always had a good team. It was a lot of hard work, but very enjoyable.\u0026#8217One of the tasks shop staff were required to perform was to operate the weighbridge \u0026#8211 and this continued until 1987.There was more to running the association that selling pottery and weighing lorries, as Mrs Coats\u0026#8217 daughter Amanda remembers. \u0026#8216There was very little storage in the shop, so mum stored the stock at home.\u0026#8216Mum travelled all over to visit suppliers and she would set off on the bus in the morning and we never knew what she would come back with.\u0026#8217After running the shop for 20 years, Mrs Coats is taking a well-earned rest as Tarbert artist Wilma MacKenzie takes over the reins.Mrs Coats said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s nice to feel it is going to continue, slightly differently perhaps, but it\u0026#8217s going to continue.\u0026#8217PICS:Sarah Coats pictured outside the shop in the 1970s. no_a31EarraGael02Mrs Coats with her friend, Tarbert artist Ann Thomas who was one of the original members of the association in 1973. 08_a30GiftShopSarah02Members and volunteers at Earra Gael today.

On Wednesday August 8 she presented the document, with 743 signatures, to Johnston Carmichael representatives in Inveraray.Speaking after her meeting with Johnston Carmichael, Marian Pallister said: \u0026#8216The petition was accepted as \u0026#8220helpful\u0026#8221 and we can now only hope that when this company has seen how things are on the ground in the various rural situations where RBS intends closure, that minds will be changed.\u0026#8217Inveraray hotelier Donald Clark also spoke to Johnston Carmichael\u0026#8217s people during their Inveraray visit and discussed a range of issues.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"avenue arch improvement scheme to be re tendered","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project to improve the condition of Inveraray\u0026#8217s iconic 18th century arches looks to be making progress as bids to carry out the work are invited.But the Dalmally road archway, refurbished around five years ago but never re-painted, will not be part of the contract.This will be the second time the work has been put out to tender by Argyll and Bute Council.Speaking at last month\u0026#8217s annual general meeting of community development company Inspire Inveraray, council regeneration manager Audrey Martin said: \u0026#8216It has already been out to tender, but the bids were too dear.

Contractors will move in tomorrow night (Saturday) in a bid to hold up the crumbling building. Works, which will take place while the line is shut, could take at least three nights to complete. In a private briefing note seen by the Ayrshire Post, council officials have outlined extensive repairs set to take place. South Ayrshire chief executive, Eileen Howat, says: The works - which can only be completed during the closure of the railway line - involve the use of a crane, lighting, cutting and drilling equipment to remove a number of unsafe materials from the roof of the building and the installation of a new exterior protective net system. Work is scheduled to start at 10pm tomorrow night with teams operating until 6am. It\u0027s understood scheduled services will not be affected. Ms Howat said contractors should complete their work within three nights but warned the findings of a trackside roof inspection could extend the process. She added: While our contractors will do everything they can to minimise any noise and disruption during this time, we do know some noise will be unavoidable. Residents in the area were informed by hand-delivered letters this afternoon. It follows the council swooping on the building earlier this summer after labelling the B Listed structure an immediate risk to public safety.

Furious Pat Spence, plagued by ill-health she says is caused by the whirring windmills, revealed Scottish Power has failed to hand over data they promised. Now Pat says: “They’re not getting their machines back until they do what they said they would. “I want a legally binding agreement stating they will supply me with the information.” The 74-year-old is at the centre of a bitter battle with Scottish Power Renewables who have been circling her home near Barrhill with hundreds of giant wind turbines. We’ve been charting Pat’s plight since last March.  The flautist and music publisher says bad vibrations makes her sick and sleep-deprived. And she says that the 19th century Dochroyle hill farm steading she has lived in for more than 30 years has changed from “dream home to torture chamber.” On one occasion she was forced into sleeping in her car in the village. The turbine blades fire infrasound waves towards her home and Pat says the alien rhythm interferes with her body’s natural rhythm. As a result she says she feels like it’s a cross between a heart attack and a panic attack and due to balance being connected to hearing, that’s what is making her sick. She simply wants the power company to buy her out. Her case has been backed by scientists and medics and she was visited again last week by retired GP and occupational physician Angela Shiells. Dr Shiells said: “I have an interest in the ill-effects of wind turbines and have been studying Pat’s case for a year.  “I have no doubt that her symptoms are related to the turbines surrounding her home.” Pat suspects the power firm have been unable to devise a method of analysis of low frequency sound despite international expert Professor Mariana Alves-Pereira being able to. She said: “Scottish Power say they would not allow the data to be released to me because Mariana would twist it. How dare they accuse her of such malpractice. All I want is my life back.” She fears large extensions are being planned for the Kilgallioch wind farm as well as the doubling in size of Arecleoch and Mark. A Scottish Power spokeswoman said: “We installed monitoring equipment in Ms Spence’s home over a year ago in response to a complaint made regarding noise. A specialist consultant is currently analysing the data on our behalf, in accordance with a protocol agreed with South Ayrshire Council and in relation to the concerns raised by Ms Spence. “This assessment and accompanying data will be shared with both South Ayrshire Council and Ms Spence in due course. “In the meantime we do require access to recover our specialist consultant’s equipment and hope Ms Spence will allow us to do so.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13075347.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_020818flushes_05JPG.jpg","title":"mixed support hgv parking plan","story":"NewsMixed support for HGV parking plan in GirvanA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:20, 13 AUG 2018NewsTown centre car park could be used by HGVs for overnight stops (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA town centre car park might well be the best site for overnight trucks, Girvan people think. At least that’s the view of four random people the Post spoke to in the town. But they want rules to ensure there aren’t trucks sitting in The Flushes car park 24/7. Ayrshire Roads Alliance are looking at a plan that would allow HGVs to park overnight. And Councillor Alec Clark supports the idea of trucks coming in from 6pm and leaving before 6am next day. But other voices in the town believe this could cause night-time noise for residents at the Hillcrest car home. And they fear excessive diesel fumes in the heart of the town.  Craig Galloway, 54, said: “Having the lorries going to The Flushes would free up the harbour area for cars and buses. And it would maybe stop them parking in the streets.” Mr Galloway added: “I think the lorries do bring a business benefit to the town, in terms of spending in shops and take-aways.” Nat Taylor, 64, thought: “The Flushes car park tends to empty at night, and the lorries are generally away first thing in the morning.” Mr Taylor added: “There’s really nowhere else that’s suitable. Ainslie car park (at the south end of the town) would only take about four HGVs.” Betty McQuiston, 76, has been involved with Girvan’s volunteer attractions committee for many years. She doesn’t want to see the town’s streets clogged up with heavy trucks. But she admitted: “ It’s a Catch 22 situation. We don’t necessarily want trucks overnight in the town - but they have to go somewhere.  “There’s already quite a lot parking in the streets, so having them at The Flushes would be better.” Mrs McQuiston added: “There’s no room at Ainslie car park, and the trucks have ripped up the surface at the harbour car park.” Scott Purdie, 49, believes a truck park could be created at Grangestone Industrial Estate. He said “It’s a big estate, with big areas of ground that could be used for overnight parking of trucks.” Mr Purdie added: “Big lorries don’t help tourism, but I can see the argument that they need somewhere to go. “However, 6pm is not late in the summer, and people in cars are sometimes frightened to park next to them. “I would fear The Flushes turning into a full-time lorry park, unless it’s properly regulated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"resident told how looked horror","story":"NewsResident told how she looked on in horror as drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at back court in Ayrshire streetMan taken away in hospital after alarm raised by concerned residentShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning11:00, 12 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA concerned resident told how she looked on in horror as a drug addict collapsed after injecting himself for 20 minutes at a back court in Cumnock. The addict was spotted shooting up behind flats in the town’s Townhead Street. He was taken by ambulance to hospital after a worried neighbour contacted the police. The shocking incident was raised at Cumnock Community Council. Now there are fears that children playing in the back court could get injured if they picked up a discarded needle. One woman said: “There was a boy injecting himself for 20 minutes near trees at a back court. “There were needles lying about.” A police officer attended the community council meeting to give residents a report of crimes that had taken place in the past month. She vowed to take the matter up with the police inspector and urged residents with any concerns about drug abuse to contact police on 101. She added new community policing teams would be introduced across East Ayrshire in September and that more community officers would be seen out on the beat. She told the meeting that police had received 49 crime reports in Cumnock for the past month and 28 of them were detected. The majority of these crimes were theft by shoplifting and occurred at the town’s ASDA, according to the officer. She pointed out there had been a spate of opportunist house break-ins in the town but not in one particular street. One robbery and serious assault had taken place in Wylie Crescent and that had been detected, the officer added. Other crimes included breach of the peace and common assaults. Bob McCulloch, the council’s acting head of housing and communities, said: “Finding a discarded needle or syringe is undoubtedly worrying for members of the public. It is essential that such items are disposed of properly and safely to protect individuals and the wider community. “If needles or syringes are found in public areas, including roads, pavements, parks or public buildings, then individuals should phone 01563 554061 during working hours or 0345 724 0000 out with working hours. Please provide as much information as you can about the exact location of the items found to aid the disposal process. “In relation to private ground, the responsibility for disposal lies with the land owner. If you find a needle or syringe on your own property you should always exercise caution and follow advice regarding their safe removal. “Wear heavy duty gloves, use tongs or tweezers to pick up the item and put the item in a suitable container, like a metal tin, a hard plastic tub or empty water bottle, always with a lid.

And this little beauty is the same age as Girvan owner Robert ‘Rab’ Smith. Retired bricklayer Rab is 62 and his Austin dates from 1956. “It’s quite a cute wee thing for its age,” said Rab of the British classic. The cars cost a mere \u0026pound507 when first launched in 1952. That was \u0026pound62 cheaper than main rival, the Morris Minor. Rab, who was also a retained firefighter for 26 years, loves a vintage car.  And he had a 1959 Austin A35, before acquiring the A30. The first owner of the new A30 in 1956 was James McCleary of Minnigaff, near Newton Stewart. Mr McCleary ran the car for years before it came into Ayrshire ownership in 1973 with first Frank Webster, then farmer Stanley Gray of Craigmalloch, Barr. Mr Gray also ran it for years, but by 1988 it was in total disrepair - and being used as a chicken coop. It was at this point that Hugh Sloan of Colmonell village came along to rescue the car. Mr Sloan took it to his workshop in Colmonell’s Main Street. And, in a labour of love, he performed a full restoration, including engine replacement and gearbox overhaul,  Hugh replaced the entire interior in 1981, re-chromed various features, and had the car re-sprayed ‘Rover Grey’. Rab said: “Hugh was totally dedicated to his car, and took it round local fetes and galas. “Sadly, he passed away in May this year when I acquired the car. “I hope to keep it in the best of condition for future generations to enjoy.” It is recorded that 223,264 Austin A30s were produced, but the survivors can now be measured in hundreds.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp. During their lifetime the sisters were very active in the village and did good work.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower.

and autonomous vehicle firm has been given the green light to deploy data-gathering cars on the streets of London as part of plans to create a driverless car service.\nFiveAI says it will spend 10 months using human-controlled cars to gather data on the roads in Bromley and Croydon \u0026ndash and the behaviour of road users such as drivers, cyclists and pedestrians \u0026ndash to help inform the development.\nThe firm is designing a shared autonomous service aimed at people who currently drive some or all of their daily commute, and hopes to have a supervised trial of automated cars on London roads by next year.\nFiveAI is designing a shared autonomous service (FiveAI)\nFiveAI co-founder Ben Peters said: \u0026ldquoFor our service to eventually operate in London, we have to learn about the road layout, topology and traffic flow.\n\u0026ldquoAs with any vehicle on the road, safety is paramount and that\u0026rsquos why all of our vehicles will be driven by fully trained safety drivers.\n\u0026ldquoWe believe that autonomous vehicles will be many times safer than human drivers, and this data-gathering phase is a vitally important step towards making that a reality. By supporting London\u0026rsquos transport objectives with a shared driverless car service, FiveAI can play a crucial role in reducing congestion, emissions, incidents and the cost and time of journeys to benefit all Londoners.\nLast year, the company was part of a consortium that was awarded a grant of more than \u0026pound12 million by the Government to develop software for an autonomous car system, a project known as StreetWise.\nFiveAI says safety is paramount (FiveAI)\nFiveAI said the data gathered during the scheme will be used solely for its driverless vehicle technology and processed and stored in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nIt said the cars will be clearly branded and identified with an \u0026ldquoobvious array of sensors to ensure full transparency.\nInterest in driverless car programmes has increased rapidly in recent years, with Google-founded Waymo and several major car manufacturers including Ford and BMW testing autonomous vehicle technology systems.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Martyn Landi, Press Association Technology Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027f6f4d2a6-62c9-422d-b864-61bcfc47165f\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk,paservice:sci-tech,paservice:sci-tech:technology\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Driverless car firm to gather data on London streets ahead of possible trial\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dalintobers summer sands","story":"In the past it appears the council helped by paying for the sand.

Visitor David Steel was two minutes behind on 28 minutes and there were eight riders in third place at about 29 minutes.One rider from Somerset, Frank Taylor, said: \u0026#8216I was born in Campbeltown but we moved away when I was seven.\u0026#8216I have been back every year since first with my parents and continued as an adult.\u0026#8216It is great to see the sporting opportunities available in Kintyre.\u0026#8217Mr Taylor said that he had ridden in many cycling club events but had never been to one so well organised.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"free tours roll out the cinemas red carpet","story":"Campbeltown Picture House is running free tours every Tuesday and Thursday in August, showcasing the revamped and expanded grade A listed building\u0026#8217s best features.Four volunteers are leading the tours, which begin at 10.30am and do not need to be booked, with those wishing to take part meeting at the cinema\u0026#8217s front desk.A Courier reporter joined 14 people of all ages \u0026#8211 and a dog \u0026#8211 on Tuesday\u0026#8217s tour, led by Geraldine Davey, and learned a few new things.The tour began by heading back outside to look at the exterior of the building, which was designed by Glasgow School of Art alumni and architect Albert Victor Gardner, at its original entrance.The tour continued into the cinema\u0026#8217s screen one, with its iconic two \u0026#8216wee hooses\u0026#8217 either side of the stage, one of which used to be a broom cupboard and the other allegedly the manager\u0026#8217s office.It was revealed that in 1960 it cost 3s to sit on the balcony and 1s 6d to sit in the stalls.People said that it was actually quite expensive at the time, with one commenting: \u0026#8216It cost a lot of pocket money to come to the cinema.\u0026#8217A few people tested the comfort of some of the 193 seats from French firm Quinette Gallay, with one gentleman who was reluctant to get up again commenting: \u0026#8216Just give me a shout when you\u0026#8217re leaving.\u0026#8217The tour continued upstairs to the balcony, where Mrs Davey pointed out the clouds painted on the roof, fitting in with the cinema\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216atmospheric\u0026#8217 status.\u0026#8216This is supposedly the closest we can get to the original,\u0026#8217 she said.She said that the cinema, once nicknamed the \u0026#8216flea pit\u0026#8217 due to its inferior stature compared to the Rex cinema, employed a pianist, Adam Ritchie Greig, when it first opened in 1913 to accompany the silent films.When \u0026#8216talkies\u0026#8217 started to become popular and his playing was no longer required, Mr Greig founded an orchestra which proved very popular for social events and functions.The tour continued into the new, second screen, which has 52 seats, with many comments on its intimate setting.The cinema operated continuously from when it first opened its doors until it closed in 2014, for three years, for £3.5 million of renovations.To find out even more take the next tours, on Tuesday August 14 and Thursday August 16, at 10.30am.Geraldine Davey, in the centre of the balcony of screen one, led her first tour of the cinema this week. 50_c32cinematours02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"costa del dalintober hosts campbeltown community regatta","story":"An active regatta sub committee of Kintyre Seasports Project met monthly  and twice in the month prior to the event.There was assistance from Jason McCallum at Keeping it Local, Krisp Print, Margaret Wallace TSI, Explore Campbeltown, Explore Kintyre and David McQuilken at Springbank.Sid Gallagher said: \u0026#8216Helen Gilchrist was a super master of ceremonies on the day.\u0026#8216Jamie McLean and Kenny Blair were power houses behind the Dalintober Beach Group organisation and contribution.\u0026#8216Jamie manually cleared half a ton of seaweed off the beach at 8am on Saturday morning.\u0026#8216The four RNLI crew members in the D-class lifeboat were on the water from 11am to 4pm despite a call out at 4am that morning and Campbeltown Coastguard also supported the event.\u0026#8217Groups involved were: Dalintober Beach group, Campbeltown Sailing Club with Guy Nicol on rescue boat, Campbeltown Sea Cadet Unit, Campbeltown Dive Group,  Campbeltown Stand Up Paddle Board group, Kintyre Canoe Club, Grant Logan Windsurfing, Kintyre Youth Cafe, Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Mr Gallagher added: \u0026#8216Campbeltown Sailing Club members Ian and Alison Paton and their two-year-old daughter Florence came up from York specially for the regatta.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy kerr open results","story":"Results: 1 A B Glendinning 85-18=67(BIH), 2 John Ramsay 86-19=67, 3 John Docherty 83-15=68 (BIH), 4 E White 81-13=68, 5 E Cappocci 76-6=70 (BIH).

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the row showed Mr Corbyn was \u0026ldquounfit for senior public office, never mind his position as the official Leader of Her Majesty\u0026rsquos Opposition.  Writing in Tuesday\u0026rsquos Daily Mail, Mr Lewis said that \u0026ldquodecent Labour members should be questioning whether Mr Corbyn should continue to lead \u0026ldquoa party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice.  Mr Lewis added: \u0026ldquoAt such a crucial time for Britain\u0026rsquos future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.  A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoJeremy did not lay any wreath at the graves of those alleged to have been linked to the Black September organisation or the 1972 Munich killings.  \u0026ldquoHe of course condemns that terrible attack, as he does the 1985 bombing.  Mr Corbyn said last year he had spoken at the conference and \u0026ldquoI laid a wreath to all those that had died in the air attack that took place on Tunis, on the headquarters of the Palestinian organisations there.  Writing in the Morning Star at the time of the visit, Mr Corbyn said wreaths had been laid not only at the memorial, but also \u0026ldquoon the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991.  The pictures emerged amid continuing controversy over Labour\u0026rsquos refusal to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, including a list of examples of anti-Semitic behaviour.  Labour launched a consultation with Jewish groups over the code, after protests that the version agreed by the party\u0026rsquos ruling National Executive Committee omits four examples relating to criticism of the state of Israel.  Mr Corbyn said on Monday that Labour\u0026rsquos version of code was the \u0026ldquomost sophisticated of any political party."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8199632.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-august-14","story":"  The Daily  reports that the Labour leader was engaged in a \u0026ldquowar of words with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his visit to the graves of the Munich Olympics terrorists.

Ms Aitken added: \u0026ldquoThe atmosphere in Glasgow during the championships has been tremendous and the welcome that people all over the city have given to athletes and visitors alike has been typically friendly and enthusiastic.  \u0026ldquoAlthough it comes as absolutely no surprise, I couldn\u0026rsquot be more proud of the way the city has embraced our friends and neighbours from across Europe.  The comments come as Team Great Britain had one of its most successful days in the games yesterday, bringing home 10 medals.  Diver Jack Laugher received his second gold of the games for the 3m springboard competition, swimmer Ben Proud came first in the 50m freestyle and teammates Adam Peaty, Nicholas Pyle, James Guy and Duncan Scott worked together to nab the top prize in the men\u0026rsquos 4x100m medley relay.  Jess Learmonth got silver in the women\u0026rsquos triathlon, Matthew Dixon and Noah Williams came second in the synchronised 10m diving while swimmers Max Litchfield and Imogen Clark also gained silver in the 400m individual medley and the 50m breaststroke respectively.

As the athletes continue to shine on the global stage, their success has prompted sportscotland to confirm the first recipients of a \u0026pound500,000 legacy fund aimed at getting communities across the country more active.  More than 90 projects will share around \u0026pound250,000 as part of GO LIVE! GET ACTIVE, a programme designed to support Community Sport Hubs (CSHs) deliver a sporting legacy from the first ever multi-sport European Championships.  The Scottish Government funding, which is being invested by sportscotland, is supporting CSHs that establish new sport or physical activity sessions to target those most inactive in communities. It is also being used to fund projects that use sport and physical activity to improve health, wellbeing and social cohesion.  Minister for sport, Joe FitzPatrick, marked the funding awards by visiting Whitacres Community Sport Hub in Glasgow, which will receive \u0026pound4,590 to deliver a series of new boxing sessions for 16 to 25-year-old women and men over the age of 40.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis \u0026pound500,000 investment will build on the enthusiasm generated by Glasgow 2018, making a lasting difference in communities throughout the country, with a positive impact on the health of individuals while boosting community cohesion.  \u0026ldquoWhitacres Community Sport Hub is a perfect example of this. In particular, I\u0026rsquove been impressed by their boxing programme, which has achieved great success with women and older people.  Meanwhile, the games are also encouraging the city to take interest in an entirely new sport \u0026ndash golf.  As the only new event in the programme at Glasgow 2018, the historic event at Gleneagles is proving popular with fans, and those who can\u0026rsquot make it along in person are gathering in George Square and Glasgow Green to watch the action unfold.

The cashier accused her of being banned from the store and, when she asked why, she claims she was told: \"Because you\u0027re Scottish\".  It has since emerged another customer with a Scottish accent was escorted from the same store last month after swearing at staff.  But Aileen has demanded a public apology, saying the incident left her \"utterly embarrassed and humiliated\".  She said: \"They abused me because of my nationality, because I\u0027m a Scottish woman.  \"Am I supposed to take the blame for everything a Scottish woman does wrong in a shop?  \"I could not believe what I was hearing.  \"All I was trying to do was buy a couple of bits from my local shop and I was made to feel like a criminal.  \"If I had been banned, do they really think I\u0027d want to go back?\"  Aileen is originally from Greenock, but has lived in Little Plumstead, near Norwich, for 35 years.  The chiropodist briefly visited the Tesco Express in Wroxham, Norfolk, on July 31 when the incident occurred.  But as she tried to pay for the items, she claims she was told she was not allowed back in the supermarket having been previously barred.  \"The young woman serving me looked at me and said I was barred,\" said Aileen.  \"She called another one over and they agreed it was me, saying they could tell due to my Scottish accent.  \"They were just standing there and smirking at me, looking at me as if to say, \u0027we\u0027ve heard it all before\u0027.  \"I asked them why they thought it was me and they seemed to think it was down to my accent.  \"All of the other shoppers were looking over at me, thinking I was lying. It was utterly embarrassing and humiliating.\"  Aileen, a divorced mum-of-two who has six grandchildren, was told she could pay for her shopping on that occasion - but she has vowed never to return to the store again.  She said: \"This has completely destroyed my life. I never want to shop there again.  \"It has affected me so much that I want to give up my shop, it has given me a reason to retire.  \"They offered to give me flowers and chocolates and a meal to say sorry, but I\u0027m not interested.  \"I want a public apology that proves they are generally sorry.\"  Her daughter Ashleigh Smith, 39, said: \"This is a woman who has never done anything wrong in her life and to be treated like that is just awful.

Sixty per cent had a \u0026ldquonegative view of the tests, with more than one-third overall having a very \u0026ldquonegative view of the process.  The social media poll of more than 364 parents across the country by parent body Connect found one- third thought that, in general, the tests had been handled well, but they would have liked more information.  The poll comes as pressure is mounting on the Scottish Government to scrap the P1 literacy and numeracy assessments, which teachers said have left some pupils \u0026ldquoshaking and crying.  The Scottish Liberal Democrats are already pressing for a parliamentary vote on the issue unless the assessments are scrapped.  However, Education Secretary John Swinney said Government guidance on the administration of the assessments was clear there should be no distress.  The tests in P1 are part of a raft of new assessments to help teachers judge the progress of pupils, with further testing in P4, P7 and S3. The Government argues testing in the first year of primary is important because it gives an idea of what level pupils are at when they come to school.  However, the online survey by Connect found 60% of those who responded expressed a \u0026ldquonegative or \u0026ldquovery negative view of them. Just 8% were positive.  Parents were also concerned about the lack of information provided by schools, with 70% not knowing their child was taking an assessment and 94% not having any feedback. More than 90% of parents were unaware they could opt for their child not to take the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of Connect, said the organisation was \u0026ldquovery concerned about the ways in which assessments were being implemented in some schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoTechnology does not always seem to be available for children to take assessments in their own classrooms. Some parents report that this has been upsetting and confusing for their child.  \u0026ldquoNot only are the tests for P1s flying in the face of Curriculum for Excellence principles, they are simply not appropriate. Research shows children at this age should be learning through play.  \u0026ldquoThe tests continue the formalisation of the early level curriculum to the detriment of many. This was a view regularly expressed by teachers and headteachers who responded to another survey amongst professionals carried out on behalf of Connect.  The survey also highlighted considerable differences in the approaches schools used to explain the assessments to children. Some were told it was a game on the computer while some were told they were having a test.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country. However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils.  Mr Swinney said: \u0026ldquoAssessments are not a new concept and the vast majority of local authorities have been carrying them out for years.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish National Standardised Assessments ensure for the first time that all schools will undertake the same assessments, providing consistency and an important means for teachers to identify children\u0026rsquos next steps in learning. That is especially valuable in early years if we are to continue to close the attainment gap.  \u0026ldquoOur approach was developed after extensive engagement with teachers, parents, children and academics. Teachers have the flexibility to manage the assessments to ensure that they are a positive experience for all children.  Mr Swinney said a government review of teacher feedback from the first year of the assessments was taking place and ministers would shortly set out changes and enhancements to the system for next year."},{"url":null,"title":"secrets-of-ancient-clan-fortress-set-to-be-revealed","story":"  Dunyvaig Castle on Islay was once a stronghold of the Lord of the Isles, the chiefs of the Clan MacDonald, and was the scene of many battles between them and rivals the Campbells.  However, it is believed that the site dates back even further to prehistoric times when it was used as an ancient fort.  A team of archaeologists now hope to uncover the history of the landmark, which was demolished in 1677, in a ground-breaking project which will see its grounds excavated for the first time.  The project is the culmination of years of planning and fundraising by Professor Steve Mithen and his team at charity Islay Heritage, who hope to provide an insight into what life was like at the castle.  Mr Mithen said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely significant project for Scotland. We are excited about finding what secrets remain hidden underground about this iconic monument.  The archaeology expert added: \u0026ldquoOne of the main questions we want to answer is what the castle was used for. We know it was a naval fortress, but was it also used for entertainment, for example. Are we likely to find a great hall where they might have entertained other lords?  \u0026ldquoOr perhaps it was a commercial centre? Trade during the medieval period was hugely important so we could discover evidence of this.  \u0026ldquoWe also want to look at whether we can identify the destruction described in historical records. In the 16th century the Campbells bombarded the castle to defeat the MacDonalds, so we\u0026rsquoll be looking for evidence of that.  \u0026ldquoWhen you dig into the ground you never know what you\u0026rsquore going to find.  A team of around 40 experts, including leading archaeologists, geophysicists, scientists and environmentalists, will take part in the initial three-week excavation at the castle, which sits in Lagavulin Bay.  Mr Mithen believes they will be able to access underground structures and objects relatively easily as the site has not been developed in the way other historic sites have been.  The project will also see local schools and community groups invited to the site to see what has been discovered, and will be used to train current archaeology students in survey and excavation methods.  Mr Mithen said: \u0026ldquoWe really want people on Isla to take an interest in their heritage. It\u0026rsquos an archaeological project for all.  John Raven, of Historic Environment Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe warmly welcome this innovative project to raise money to support Islay Heritage and its aims of raising the profile and condition of, and increasing access to, Islay\u0026rsquos spectacular and unique archaeology, history and culture.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fantastic opportunity for heritage to make a greater contribution to the island\u0026rsquos economy.  \u0026ldquoDunyvaig Castle holds a deeply important place in Gaelic culture, and the excavations should help us better understand Medieval Gaelic culture and inform the castle\u0026rsquos conservation, so that it can be preserved and access opened up in the future.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot wait to see the results.  The project has been part-funded by the Lagavulin 200th Legacy fund, a scheme by the Diageo distillery to raise money for community projects through the sale of a special bottling of Lagavulin malt whisky.  Dr Nick Morgan, head of Whisky Outreach at Diageo, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking forward to seeing what interesting discoveries will be uncovered over the next few weeks.

The researchers said some of the effects are similar to those seen in cigarette smokers and people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Professor David Thickett, lead author from the University of Birmingham, said: \"In terms of cancer causing molecules in cigarette smoke, as opposed to cigarette vapour, there are certainly reduced numbers of carcinogens.  \"They are safer in terms of cancer risk, but if you vape for 20 or 30 years and this can cause COPD, then that\u0027s something we need to know about.\"  He added: \"I don\u0027t believe e-cigarettes are more harmful than ordinary cigarettes.  \"But we should have a cautious scepticism that they are as safe as we are being led to believe.\"  Many studies have focused on the chemical make-up of e-cigarette liquid before it is vaped, the researchers said.  However, they developed a procedure to mimic vaping in the laboratory, testing the effect of e-cigarette vapour condensate on alveolar macrophages extracted from the lung tissue samples of eight non-smokers.  The condensate was found to be more harmful to the cells than plain e-cigarette fluid, and the effects worsened as the \"dose\" was increased.  The researchers said further work is needed to fully understand the effects of vapour exposure in humans, but added: \"We suggest continued caution against the widely held opinion that e-cigarettes are safe.\"  Commenting on the findings, Professor John Britton, director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, said: \"This study demonstrates evidence that lung cells exposed to electronic cigarette vapour become inflamed, as would be expected given that electronic cigarette vapour contains oxidant and other pro-inflammatory constituents.  \"This indicates that long-term use of electronic cigarettes is likely to have adverse effects, as is widely recognised by leading health authorities in the UK including the Royal College of Physicians and Public Health England.  \"However, since electronic cigarettes are used almost exclusively in the UK by current or former smokers, the key question is how this adverse effect compares with that of exposure to cigarette smoke.\"  He added: \"The harsh truth is that smoking kills, and smokers who switch completely to electronic cigarettes are likely to substantially reduce the likelihood of premature death and disability.\""},{"url":null,"title":"rail-fares-are-increasing-twice-as-fast-as-wages-new-analysis-shows","story":"  Research by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) found fares have risen by around 32 per cent in nine years compared with 16% for average weekly earnings.

The latest increase will be confirmed when the July Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation is released by the Office for National Statistics tomorrow.  The Department for Transport (DfT) uses July\u0027s RPI to determine the annual increase in regulated train fares, which comes into force every January.  ScotRail\u0026rsquos peak fares increased by 3.6% at the start of this year, with the cost of off peak tickets rising by 2.6%. Elsewhere in the UK, all regulated fares increased by 3.6%.  Campaigners argue fare rises should be pegged to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), as it is generally lower than RPI. But the RMT said this would still have seen the cost of tickets increase 36% faster than wages over the same period.  It claimed commuters across the UK are being \"ripped off\", with train tickets \"massively\" more expensive than the rest of Europe.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos transport spokesman Colin Smyth branded the predicted fare hikes \u0026ldquototally unacceptable, insisting they show the \u0026ldquogreat train robbery facing Scotland\u0026rsquos rail passengers continues.  He said: \u0026ldquoScottish Labour research revealed that commuters were already paying up to a fifth of their wages on fares \u0026ndash and that is before another eye-watering hike.  RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said British rail fares are up to five times more expensive than elsewhere in Europe, adding: \u0026ldquoThat is nothing short of a scandal.  He said: \"Even if fares were pegged at the more modest CPI these latest increases would still massively outstrip wages leaving the British passenger to pay through the nose to travel on rammed out and unreliable services.  \"Meanwhile the rail companies, the majority of whom are foreign state-owned, are using the British transport system as a cash-cow to hold down their own domestic fares. That is a nonsense and must be stopped.  \"It is no wonder that passenger numbers are falling when they are paying more and more for less and less.  He insisted this \u0026ldquolatest kick in the teeth for passengers is another nail in the coffin for privatisation and it is now a question of when not if our railways are nationalised.\"  The Campaign for Better Transport, which promotes better bus and rail services, has urged the Government to \"commit to a fares freeze\" while services are improved. This was echoed by former Labour transport secretary Lord Adonis.  Next year\u0026rsquos anticipated fare hike comes as research showed passenger satisfaction with rail punctuality and reliability has fallen in the last decade.  Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies, insisted 98p from every pound spent on train fares is invested back into the railways.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said ScotRail\u0026rsquos fare increases are lower on average than those elsewhere in the UK.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis is a result of our policy to place a cap that is lower than RPI on regulated off-peak fare increases, whereas the UK Government applies an increase at the level of RPI to all regulated fares.  \"Passengers make a contribution towards the cost of running the railway through rail fares, however, we meet the majority of the cost of rail passenger services in Scotland.  \"We have taken action to keep fares down: regulated ScotRail peak fares increases are capped at the level of the RPI and regulated off-peak fares at one per cent lower than inflation.  A DfT spokesman said: \"Any fare increase is unwelcome, but it is not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do.  \"Taxpayers already subsidise the network by more than \u0026pound4 billion a year \u0026ndash meaning that 38% of our transport budget is spent on the 2% of journeys that the railway accounts for.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8199666.jpg?type=article-full","title":"edinburgh-ready-to-face-up-to-dark-past-of-henry-dundas-philanthropist-who-also-championed-slavery","story":"  Oxford University has refused to scrap a statue of arch-imperialist Cecil Rhodes, while Bristol is renaming a hall named after slave trader Edward Colston. In the United States, such \u0026lsquoreverse airbrushing\u0026rsquo has seen New Orleans and other cities remove statues of Southern general Robert E. Lee and other confederate monuments.  Now Edinburgh is close to finding a solution to address the legacy of Henry Dundas. The first Viscount Melville (the title was created for him) is commemorated, by way of a statue which sits on top of a 150 foot pillar in St Andrews Square. But, despite his own controversial history, campaigners do not want the statue removed. Instead they want a plaque which describes him to give a fuller account of the role of the Scottish Conservative politician.  A low plaque currently informs visitors who search for it that he was a dominant figure in politics for more than 40 years. \u0026ldquo Besides being treasurer to the navy he was lord advocate \u0026amp keeper of the Scottish signet.  But Dundas was more than that, according to Adam Ramsay, co-editor of Open Democracy: Hewas an enthusiastic funder of slavery, who as home secretary sent troops to put down revolts against slavery and oppression. \u0026ldquoHe was directly responsible for the transportation of the Scottish Martyrs, Mr Ramsay says. As First Lord of the Admiralty he also had a pivotal role in the expansion of the British Empire:    Most significantly, he delayed the abolition of slavery, his gradualist approach allowing the practise to continue for 15 more years than it would otherwise have done, during which time an estimated 630,000 people were transported to Britain as slaves.  In 2016, Mr Ramsay petitioned Edinburgh City Council to find a way better reflect both sides of the Viscount\u0026rsquos legacy. A receptive council set up a panel to look at the issue and this is now close to a resolution.  \u0026ldquoWe all have different perspectives, but we have a proposed wording . The council are going to meet to discuss it and we expect a decision within the next few weeks, he add.  The eventual resolution could highlight the role of Scotland in the empire, he says. \u0026ldquoBroadly, while many English people look back on the empire as a brilliant thing, Scots have tended to view it as awful \u0026ndash but all the fault of the English. But huge numbers of Scottish people profited and still profit from Empire, including my own family. It is important we have a conversation about our role.  Another of the panellists, Sir Geoffrey Palmer, emeritus professor of brewing and distilling at Heriot Watt University, is equally adamant these questions need to be addressed. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down, he says. \u0026ldquoIt would be much better if the plaque explained more accurately what Hentry Dundas did. He used the law to take away people\u0026rsquos rights. It was self interest. It should be on his plaque. We are not asking for very much. I lecture around the country and people say to me \u0026lsquo why hasn\u0026rsquot anybody told us about this?\u0026rsquo  Bobby Melville, the 10th and current Viscount Melville once criticised proposals to change the plaque as \u0026ldquowrong in almost every particular. However he too is on the panel and has reportedly moderated his view. \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to hear about bad decisions that seemingly he decided to take, he now says of his ancestor. \u0026ldquoBut he also did a lot of good. I don\u0026rsquot think the evil dictator was the image people had when they named streets and drew portraits and put up statues to him, he adds.  Councillor Donald Wilson, Culture and Communities Convener at the City of Edinburgh Council, said a committee would consider the proposals: \u0026ldquoThe Melville Monument in St Andrew Square is a tribute to Henry Dundas, yet many people do not realise who he was.  \u0026ldquoIf we can make it clearer that the statue at the top is one of Henry Dundas \u0026ndash and perhaps help people learn more about who he was \u0026ndash then that is surely worthy of consideration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6231372.jpg?type=article-full","title":"german-supermarket-chains-better-than-british-at-displaying-scottish-lamb","story":"  National Farmers Union Scotland said that a shelf watch showed that Asda, The Co-operative and Waitrose were \"found wanting\" with no Scottish lamb available on shop aisles.  And it was two German supermarket chains that supported Scottish lamb best - Aldi and Lidl - with all produce sold being marked Scottish.  It comes after the NFUS members and staff carried out a shelf watch over 50 Scottish supermarket over the first ten days of this month to identify which retailers are doing their part to support Scottish sheep farmers during peak production season.  The First Minister announced a campaign to promote Scottish lamb would benefit from \u0026pound200,000 of new funding, while the NFUS secret shopper survey was being carried out. The funding will support Quality Meat Scotland\u0026rsquos 2018 Scotch lamb promotional campaign.    The shoppers counted over 2,500 packs of Scottish lamb, which has protected status under EU law, and identified which of the big supermarkets were sourcing the most Scottish and home-produced lamb.  But the NFUS said the results \"notably demonstrate\" that Asda continue to stock significant volumes (40%) of imported lamb, where many of its competitors have chosen to source Scottish and British lamb exclusively. It also found that no lamb was labelled as Scottish in the Co-operative and Waitrose.  The NFUS said the majority of lamb in the Tesco, Sainsbury\u0026rsquos, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi stores, however, was labelled as Scotch Lamb PGI (protected geographical indication), giving the farming sector \"reason to be encouraged\" despite the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit, the NFUS said.  They found that Marks and Spencer stocked 26% Scottish, while at Sainsbury\u0027s it was 56%, at Tesco it was 59% and at Morrisons it was 73%.    NFU Scotland\u0026rsquos livestock committee chairman Charlie Adam said they would be raising the issue of stocking Scottish lamb with Asda in the coming days.  He said: \u0026ldquoThese shelf watch results show that support for Scottish and UK lamb producers is strong from a number of retailers, providing confidence to the sector. Indeed, six out of the nine supermarket chains that we visited were stocking only lamb produced in Scotland or the UK.  \u0026ldquoWhile the majority of the lamb was home-produced it was disappointing to see that Asda, The Co-operative and Waitrose had no lamb labelled as Scottish available.  \"In particular ASDA is way off the mark with competitors \u0026ndash stocking hundreds of packs of imported lamb at a time when Scottish lamb producers are busy finishing their stock. \"    Last year, campaign group Keep Scotland the Brand was launched, prompted by the steady disappearance of the Saltire on Scottish-grown food, and its replacement by Union flag packaging.  The #KeepScotlandtheBrand movement has been growing after fed-up customer Ruth Watson began tweeting pictures of Scottish products in supermarkets packaged under a Union flag.  alkers, the Moray-based family producers of oatcakes, cakes and biscuits got support in the House of Commons in March in the wake of one row over Union Flag branding with some warning of a boycott.  Joint managing director Jim Walker said he was \"not ashamed\" to use Union Flag branding on what he described as a niche novelty products sold in London and abroad as gift items and insisted he and the company are \"proud to be Scottish\".  The executive which sells products in over 60 countries spoke out against those who were \"mis-calling\" his company last week and warned that boycotts \"kill Scottish jobs\".  The new NFUS results come a day before the Lairg store lamb sale, one of the largest one-day sales of sheep in Europe.  They showed that almost 45% of the lamb available was branded with the Scotch Lamb PGI, with an additional 44% labelled as British or Welsh.  Aimi McNeill of The Co-operative said that Scottish-sourced lamb would be branded British.  She said: \"Co-op own-brand fresh lamb is 100% British across our entire store estate and we are proud to support British and Scottish farmers.  \"All of our fresh own brand lamb is 100% British and labelled as such. We announced this policy last May as part of our commitment to British and Scottish agriculture.  \"Regional lamb lines mean Scottish lamb is stocked in our Scottish stores.\"  Waitrose and Asda were approached for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"population-of-hares-down-to-only-1-of-level-recorded-60-years-ago","story":"  The Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology and the RSPB teamed up to study counts of the animals over several decades on moorland managed for red grouse shooting and nearby mountain land.  From 1954 to 1999, the mountain hare population on moorland sites decreased by almost five per cent every year, the study found, saying the long-term decline was likely to be due to land-use changes such as the loss of grouse moors to conifer forests.  However, from 1999 to 2017 the scale of the \u0026ldquosevere moorland declines increased to over 30% every year, leading to counts last year of less than one per cent of original levels in 1954, researchers said.  On higher, alpine sites, numbers of mountain hares fluctuated, but increased overall until 2007, and then declined, although not to the lows seen on the moorland sites, the study noted.  The report stated: \u0026ldquoThe study found long-term declines in mountain hare densities on moorland, but not alpine, sites in the core area of UK mountain hare distribution in the eastern Highlands of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThese moorland declines were faster after 1999 at a time when hare culling by grouse moor managers with the specific aim of tick and LIV control has become more frequent.  Gamekeepers and estate managers claim culls limit the spread of ticks, protect trees and safeguard fragile environments, and a policy of voluntary restraint is in place.  However, campaigners believe the practice is cruel and unnecessary. The research paper, being published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, stated: \u0026ldquoOn moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to \u0026lt1% of initial levels after 2008.  \u0026ldquoBefore 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999.  The findings were revealed after the annual grouse shooting season got under way yesterday.  Lead author of the study, Dr Adam Watson of the Centre for Ecology \u0026amp Hydrology, said: \u0026ldquoHaving counted mountain hares across the moors and high tops of the eastern Highlands since 1943, I find the decline in numbers of these beautiful animals both compelling and of great concern.  \u0026ldquoWe need the Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage to take action to help these iconic mammals of the hill \u0026ndash I hope they will listen to the voice of scientific research.  The RSPB said urgent action is needed to protect mountain hares.  Duncan Orr Ewing, head of species and land management at the charity in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe consider that large-scale population reduction culls are both illegal under EU law and unwarranted as a method for controlling grouse disease.  But the Scottish Moorland Group said the research was \u0026ldquoout of kilter with other respected studies and said RSPB Scotland was continuing \u0026ldquoits political campaigning against grouse moor management.  This view was supported by a spokesman for The Scottish Gamekeepers Association, who said: \u0026ldquoThis work is largely at odds with what is being seen on the ground in grouse moor areas, where hare numbers \u0026ndash in good breeding seasons \u0026ndash remain very, very high, sometimes reaching densities of up to 200 hares per sq km.  \u0026ldquoData held by GWCT shows the number of hares taken on grouse moors shows no overall discernible trend since 1954, despite the claims by those seeking to legislate against grouse shooting that culls have been escalated to protect grouse. The average annual hare cull of 25,000 represents only 7% of the estimated population.  \u0026ldquoWhilst on Scottish grouse moors hare numbers remain amongst the highest in Europe, we know there are campaigning wildlife charities, looking after hundreds of sites, with suitable habitat but no mountain hares at all. That revelation may shock and will become clearer to the public and government when the new counting methods are widely adopted, which is what the SGA is calling for.  Meanwhile, grouse shooting season has opened, but some estates in Scotland have cancelled shoots due to exceptional weather, the March cold spell and the dry summer, hitting breeding stock."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-considering-workplace-parking-levy","story":"  A committee will examine a workplace parking levy \"to set out the argument and rationale\" for the overhaul.

Mr Brokenshire said: \u0026ldquoProviding high quality and well managed social housing is a core priority for this Government.  \u0026ldquoOur green paper offers a landmark opportunity for major reform to improve fairness, quality and safety for residents living in social housing across the country.  \u0026ldquoRegardless of whether you own your home or rent, residents deserve security, dignity and the opportunities to build a better life.  The key proposals which form the foundation of the green paper include:  \u0026ndash Steps to speed up the complaints process, providing access to effective dispute resolution when something goes wrong and giving tenants more support in accessing the redress options available to them.  \u0026ndash New reforms to make it easier for tenants to progress into home ownership, such as allowing them to purchase as little as 1% of their property each year through the Government\u0026rsquos shared ownership programme.  \u0026ndash Strengthening the regulator of social housing so it can focus on issues that matter most to tenants and has \u0026ldquosharper teeth to intervene when needed, ensuring social homes are well managed and of decent quality.  \u0026ndash Allowing councils to continue to have choice over their use of fixed-term tenancies, enabling them to offer residents greater security in their homes.  \u0026ndash The introduction of performance indicators and new league tables, rebalancing the landlord/tenant relationship to hold bad practice to account and ensure residents are treated with dignity and respect.  In a separate move, to boost the number of Local Authority homes, a consultation into how councils spend the money from Right to Buy sales has also been launched.

His comments came as Ms Sturgeon visited Turriff Show, Scotland’s second biggest agricultural event after the Royal Highland Show.                                                    Mr Chapman has written to Transport Scotland to seek clarity after local officials suggested that the bypass would be granted “special road” status, excluding agricultural vehicles.        The issue was highlighted by NFU Scotland during a round table discussion at the New Deer Show last month and farmers are concerned they will have difficulty transporting livestock, particularly those making the journey from Ellon to the other side of the city at Portlethen.Mr Chapman, who is also a farmer, said the situation also raises the question of increased greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural vehicles being forced to travel through the city.He said: “My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.“I have written to Transport Scotland, but I have yet to receive a response. I would urge Nicola Sturgeon to speak up on behalf of our local farmers so that common sense can prevail and this ill-thought ban is lifted.”                                                                                                        Local SNP MSP Gillian Martin said that a public consultation regarding the route had been carried out in 2007 although views can still be put to Transport Scotland.She added: “I believe the NFU Scotland did submit to that. It’s unclear whether a call for access to agricultural vehicles was included in their submission at that point.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

Then, despite repeated promises over the last year, ministers failed to reach an agreement that would allow Road Equivalent Tariff to be introduced on external ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“This has left people in Orkney angry and frustrated, not least as we see another tourism season come and go with no sign of the cheaper fares. Worse still, there has been no indication from the Scottish Government what steps it is taking to try to unlock this impasse.“The transport secretary must set out clearly what he has done and plans to do to reach a resolution. He must also reaffirm that any fare reductions will be backdated to the end of June this year as previously promised. The funding has been set aside and must benefit those using these lifeline services.“While Mr Matheson is new in post, he must treat this issue as a priority. He must know that the longer this shambles goes on, the worse it reflects on him and the government.”A Scottish Government spokesperson responded: “We remain committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles and are currently undertaking further work on the issue. As a first step, we have cut fares on the Aberdeen to Lerwick and Kirkwall to Lerwick services by around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

pub in Fortrose is up for sale with an asking price of nearly half a million pounds.The Anderson bar and restaurant, featuring 13-guest rooms, nine of which are en-suite, is up for grabs for

son, who is now 18 and heading to university, in the hotel, which they purchased in 2003.The couple, who emigrated from Philadelphia, also have a home on the Black Isle.Mr Anderson (61) said the property was \"a viable family business in a setting that was a great place for a family to live and raise their children\".He said he would sell it as a house or as a hotel business but added: \"If I could pick and choose our buyer I would say it would be someone a lot like us who would have a vision of where they want to take it. It\u0026rsquos a flexible industry.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The number of property viewings conducted by Galbraith in the Highlands has increased from 167 this time last year to 216 in 2018, a rise of 29 per cent.Increased demand has also seen the average time taken to sell property drop by 21 per cent since last year.Phiddy Robertson, who handles residential sales for Galbraith in Inverness, revealed that the average price of property sold from the firm\u0026rsquos Inverness office during the quarter rose 14.8 per cent from \u0026pound284,992 in the previous quarter to \u0026pound327,21\"The market has picked up significantly since 2015 and in 2018 the first six months show a steady increase in activity,\" she said.\"Demand for well-sited property remains high, with competition leading to more closing dates, most of which achieve significant premiums over the asking price, while there is also greater movement at the top end of the residential market.\"The region continues to be a draw for new residents moving in from outside the area.\"While prices are rising, the Highland area remains less expensive than many other parts of the UK and we see buyers from all over the country making the move here to enjoy a better quality of life,\" Ms Robertson added.The UK government House Price Index for May 2018 noted that the largest regional increase in sales by volume in Scotland was for the Highland region, where volumes increased by 3.9 per cent on the previous year.Currently on the market with Galbraith in Inverness are the following properties:The Galbraith letting department for Inverness also enjoyed a busy quarter.The number of relets agreed increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Viewings also increased by five per cent for rental properties and the average time taken to find a tenant for a rental property was just six days.Sarah Hazzard, who manages lettings for Galbraith in Inverness, said: \"We find that both city-centre properties and well-presented cottages in rural areas are snapped up soon after becoming available.\"Landlords are able to increase the rents they charge between tenancies due to the very limited supply of rental property in Inverness-shire and the very strong demand from tenants.

I have been to a college fresher\u0026rsquos fair on Skye. They invite us each year and we have a stall, which is great.\"The people that we meet have no problems at all.

The result is that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"\u0026nbspThe society hopes to screen at least one movie a week drawn from the film programme at Eden Court in Inverness.It would initially be volunteer-run but there are plans to eventually train up managers and projectionists \"who would also be able to work at Eden Court\".Mr Mackenzie-Blackman said sharing films in this way would allow the film society to avoid having to pay licensing fees.He said, in addition, Eden Court may handle online bookings from its box office in Inverness.He added: \"If Cromarty and Resolis Film Society raise the money needed to make the project happen I will be firmly supportive of it.\"We will work in collaboration with them to help them project the cinema in Cromarty.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down. It keeps bursting and they keep fixing it. It\u0026rsquos a nuisance and it\u0026rsquos been happening more and more often over the last few years.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Tuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Edinburgh could become the first local authority area in Scotland to charge companies for allowing employees to park at work.                Councillors are considering a workplace parking levy, which could also include customer parking, as part of a campaign to cut congestion and air pollution.            The SNP-Labour administration’s transport and environment committee has agreed to investigate setting up the scheme and will “set out the argument and rationale” for the charge.            In Nottingham, which in 2010 became the first place in the UK to introduce the levy, businesses are charged £402 each year per space and the money goes towards transport improvements, including extending the city’s tram network. Employers can choose to reclaim the cost of the levy from their employees. All organisations and premises with more than ten parking places are liable for the charge.Scottish councils would need permission from the Scottish Government to introduce the charge, which could be achieved through an amendment to its Transport Bill.The levy is backed by transport group Transform Scotland, which has said it could be applied to “workplaces as well as other types of premises”, raising the prospect of out-of-town shopping centres having to pay the levy to provide free parking to customers. Edinburgh’s transport and environment convener Lesley Macinnes said: “We’re still at a very early stage and our next steps will involve setting out an argument and rationale for introducing a workplace parking levy in order to seek the necessary legislative changes from the Scottish Government to introduce such a measure.“However, we’re confident that introducing a workplace parking levy would achieve many benefits – reducing the number of car journeys made into the city and in turn lowering congestion, improving air quality and encouraging active travel.            “This would very much be part of our broader ambitions to transform the way we use the city centre, including the introduction of a Low Emission Zone (LEZ) and proposals for city centre transformation.”It is hoped the levy would generate around £9 million a year to pay for improvements to Edinburgh’s transport network, but council officers said the annual revenue could be as much as £15m.A report to councillors said: “Edinburgh is a commuter work destination. We have issues with our road maintenance and investment in transport infrastructure.“Introducing a workplace parking levy in Edinburgh would be an example of devolving further responsibility and powers to local authorities and could support investment in our transport infrastructure and maintenance.”            Conservatives opposed the council’s stance on introducing the policy and asked for a balanced report on the positives and negatives of the levy.Nick Cook said: “We are almost setting an assumption that the council is in favour of introducing a workplace parking levy.”His Conservative colleague Scott Douglas added: “It seems like we are putting the cart before the horse. I think we should take time to consider it in both pros and cons with it. I also have concerns over business engagement with it.”Green councillor Chas Booth asked the committee whether there was “an opportunity to include customer parking as well” in the scheme. He said: “Some recognise it as a missing link in sustainable transport.”The committee agreed to include looking at a “wider non-residential parking levy which could also cover customer parking spaces”.            Plans for a LEZ have been billed as having the potential to “leave a legacy” for future generations.The council is carrying out an eight-week public consultation on how to shape the future of transport in Edinburgh.A prospectus outlining three visions, including a radical approach where the city centre would be “largely traffic-free”, will form the start of a long consultation process with the public.Key roads across Edinburgh will be closed to traffic once a month in what will also be a Scottish first. The traffic-free days, which could shut down areas including Portobello and Stockbridge, are due to start early next year."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783068.1534161917!/image/image.jpg","title":"idyllic scottish island dubbed hawaii of the north offers beach house to new minister","story":"        It is the most westerly island of the Inner Hebrides, a remote community sometimes known as the \u0026#8220Hawaii of the north\u0026#8221 thanks to its white sand beaches and clear blue waters.                Now locals on Tiree are looking for a new minister to lead the Church of Scotland congregation on the island, which covers an area of 30 square miles.            While one of the Kirk’s more remote postings, whoever takes up the job will be able to enjoy living in a manse just yards from the beach as well as performing a prominent role in the tight-knit community, which has a Christian tradition dating back to the sixth century.            Jo Bennett, clerk of the congregation’s nominating committee, said: “People talk about Iona as a thin place – a place where the distance between heaven and earth collapses.  “I think Tiree has that too, but it’s also very much a working community - you get both aspects here.“A minister here has the chance to see the impact of the work they do and be the focal point for the community.”READ MORE: Message in a bottle sent from Iceland washes up on Tiree after a yearMr Bennett said the congregation was regularly boosted in the summer months by visitors from around the world.             “In Summer we get visitors from around the world but in winter it may be much smaller,” he added.“It’s always a mixture of people who visit regularly and people visiting for the first time.”The manse is situated outside the village of Scarinish, just yards from the sea and with views to the Treshnish Isles, Mull and Iona across the passage of Tiree.Although the church building only dates to 1902, Tiree has a long Christian tradition going back to St Columba and his companion Beithene, who was the abbot on the island in the sixth century.            The local population boasts the highest proportion of Gaelic speakers in the Inner Hebrides.An advert for the position states: “We seek a minister who finds that their heart resonates with this island and this community who can meet us where we are and help guide us towards where we should be who can “be Christ” in this place to people who need His love.“Tiree is not a place that allows for anything other than going ‘all in’.“People will know when you leave the Manse they’ll know where you’ve been visiting what you’ve been buying in the Co-op and when your cooker has stopped working.“But they will also wave and stop for a chat when they see you notice the work you put in to visiting and come by with food or invite you round for dinner when your cooker isn’t working.” "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4782243.1533918106!/image/image.jpg","title":"interview rose mcgowan is out to expose the real hollywood","story":"        Rose McGowan, one of the first women to make public allegations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein, has become a lightning rod for the #MeToo movement. The writer and campaigner talks to Janet Christie about misogyny and movies ahead of her Edinburgh International Book Festival appearance                If there’s one word that sums up activist, former actor, director, author, model and singer, Rose McGowan, one of the first to publicly speak out against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, now accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 90 women, it’s ‘brave’. Brave, the title of her memoir and manifesto is a call to arms for us all to wake up to the misogyny of the entertainment industry and beyond, her bid to give voice to the victims of sexism and violence and to join her Rose Army of free thinkers striving to make things better and reclaim their lives.             Set for the Edinburgh International Book Festival, McGowan comes on the phone from London, excited about her appearance and keen to spread the word.            Raw and revealing, the book follows McGowan from a childhood growing up in the Children of God cult, to Hollywood and movies, through her relationships with rocker Marilyn Manson and director Robert Rodriguez, through her alleged attack by Weinstein and its aftermath, to her reawakening and speaking out. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: The shows that were inspired by #MeTooArticulate and intelligent, she responds to questions without equivocation. This Rose is attractive and friendly, yet she has thorns.“It’s about getting braver in our lives by at least 10 per cent – I think that’s a do-able number. We sweep things under the rug because we’re too scared to confront them, but I’m here to tell you if you just go through it, if you look at the wound you can clean it, don’t let it fester, let it heal then you can have a free life. But if you continually cover the sore and pretend it’s not there, it will eat away at you. Bravery isn’t just you being brave out in the world, it’s also with yourself.” In Brave, McGowan says the alleged attack by Weinstein happened in his hotel suite at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival when she was invited there after a screening of her film Going All the Way. McGowan says he later contacted her but she rebuffed his advances and after accepting a payment of $100,000, which she says she took as an acknowledgment of what had taken place, she says she was blacklisted by Weinstein and her career sidelined.            She doesn’t name him in her book, she’s taken back control and won’t have “The Monster’s” name in it – today she calls him “that warthog from hell”. Of his refusal to acknowledge what she says happened, she says simply, “Of course. Which just makes you feel terrible. Every time his lawyers say ‘consensual’ it gives me a body flashback and makes me sick to my stomach, consensual my ass. Like I would ever let that warthog from hell touch me. I wish he would cease to exist. I just wish he was not on the planet anymore, just cease.”McGowan had always spoken about the alleged attack privately, but her battle against Hollywood became public when she discovered the power of Twitter in 2015. After receiving a casting note for an audition for an Adam Sandler film that suggested she wear a form fitting top, push up bra and show some cleavage, she rolled her eyes, posted it on Twitter and went to bed. In the morning she woke up to an internet storm of support, calling out Hollywood’s sexism.Did she think ‘oh brilliant’, or ‘oh no, what have I done?’She laughs, “Kind of both. At first I thought ‘oh no’, then I thought actually that’s brilliant, then I thought ‘oh no’ again. It’s very strange when things go viral and you’re in people’s heads, on their phones, it’s powerful and weird and nice being on the other side of it.”            Silenced in the world of Hollywood, the internet was an arena in which McGowan found her voice. “There was no way to speak out if someone was controlling the media and dominating it. But they can’t control the internet, you have your freedom and your access route.”So when Fox promoted the new X-Men film with an image of Jennifer Lawrence being strangled, she published online an open letter of objection, part of a backlash against the promotion that saw it withdrawn. Writing in her book she says, “I felt an obligation to be a voice for women, people who had suffered from violence.”• READ MORE: Chris McCall: Book Festival’s good-natured debate is antidote to TrumpBut why does McGowan think it’s on her to object, why does she have this strong sense of obligation?             “It sometimes feels like if I don’t, who else is going to? If not me, then who, and why not me? I have a special tool set. I’ve dealt with some of the big baddies and I’ve had a lot of hardship and I’ve battled through them and I’ve survived. And I know you can help others get to the other side. “I’ve always had a thing for justice, I don’t know what it is, I just don’t like seeing misjustice and I certainly don’t like predators.” McGowan spears Hollywood’s misogyny in Brave, pointing out that in 2016 only 23 per cent of speaking roles on screen were female, the majority in horror films. “And we know how they get treated,” she writes. Further, The Directors Guild of America is 96 per cent male, and has been since 1946, which McGowan argues means that for your entire life you have been fed a steady diet of largely male thought and bias about women. “Why is 96 per cent of our information, entertainment and philosophy coming from men?... Film and television is a white male’s playground and through their narrow vision comes the manipulated mirror you’re largely forced to see yourself in. If that’s not malewashing I don’t know what is.”With an online following calling out sexism, when people started talking about harassment by Trump in 2016, McGowan didn’t hesitate to join #whywomendontreport (their sexual assault) debate.  “Trump helped elucidate what sexism and racism are, filled it out in big burning block letters and people went ‘oh, that’s what this is’. Thanks Trump!” She laughs.McGowan says she is speaking up for people like her, the disenfranchised, the hurt, the lost, the lonely, the brave ones who choose to live their lives differently, see things differently and function in a society that doesn’t want them in their own way. “The Rose Army is an army of thought,” she says. “We stand for freedom of spirit and mind. We stand for dissent. We stand for equality and the right to have our lives be unencumbered by proscribed thoughts and traditional mores.” McGowan’s book festival appearance is tied to the theme of identity, and the idea of whether we choose our own identity or have one forced upon us.“I grew up in a really unusual way that led me to have my own identity and not be co-opted,” she says, “and then later as an actor I played multiple identities so identity has always been a really interesting idea for me.”Now 44, it was growing up among the Children of God in rural Tuscany in the Seventies that McGowan first learnt to retreat into her own head, rejecting the rules of the cult. Then later after the family escaped and returned to America, she was bounced among relatives, but found solace in reading, identifying with the persona of each book’s protagonist, a harbinger of her later career. “I used my training from books, absolutely, it’s the only acting training I’ve ever had,” she says. • READ MORE: Edinburgh Fringe 2018: 18 must-see shows picked by The Scotsman’s criticsIf McGowan’s childhood reads as traumatic, she also manages to convey the pleasure she and the pack of cult children took in their Tuscan playground, the rows of marching cypresses and olive groves, despite often being hungry, confused and scared. And it was growing up in a cult that made her alert to the mechanics of control when she arrived in the US, then later in Hollywood.“When I came out of the Children of God everybody was saying how weird it was, how I lived and grew up, and I just thought ‘well, it’s weird how you live, you’re living under the same kind of dictates, you’re just not aware of it’. Everything was the same except bigger and more diluted. I thought ‘if you think you’re free, you’re not’. I was really shocked to find how the same belief systems being utilised, but a more internalised version.”After leaving home at 15, she headed to LA where she was discovered standing on a street corner and offered a part on a film, Paul Shore’s 1992 comedy Encino Man. To the hungry and homeless McGowan, it was a means of survival. “I was a journeyman actor, it was not my love, it was just something I happened to be good at.”Success followed with The Doom Generation and she made her breakthrough in horror flick Scream, then headlined in Going All the Way, Devil in the Flesh and Jawbreaker, yet by the end of the 1990s, according to McGowan because she was being sidelined, the big film roles had dried up. Switching to TV she was a lead in supernatural series Charmed from 2001-6, then in a return to film starred in Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s double-feature film Grindhouse in 2007. Parts in Fifty Dead Men Walking, Conan and other films followed then in 2014 she realised an ambition and made her directorial debut with the critically acclaimed short film Dawn, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.Since Dawn McGowan’s time has been taken up with Brave and the creation of a multimedia album, Planet 9, released in January at the same time as the book.“I’m really excited about performing it at my first music festival in Norway in November,” she says. “Planet 9 is kind of the other side of the book, where you go once your brain has been changed. It’s a place I invented, then astronomers found a Planet 9 four years ago – I almost fell off my chair! So I started writing songs for this place, and music. It’s my sanity. My art projects are what has kept me sane, that and my therapy.”McGowan is also writing a second book, on the subject of trust, a behind the scenes story of her life as she set about telling her story, a time in which she says ex-Mossad agents hired by Weinstein to quash misconduct allegations, followed her. “What is trust, how do we do it? I had to learn how to trust, otherwise you’re never going to trust anybody again in your entire life.”Given her experiences, how many people does she trust in her life now?“I trust about seven people,” she says, “and then the rest of the world, I hope,” she laughs.Seven’s quite a lot, I tell her.“Yeah, I’m doing pretty good,” she laughs and reconsiders. “Maybe it’s about three or four.”Fighting the Hollywood machine would deplete your faith in human nature, not to mention your resources. Ask McGowan where she lives now, and she comes straight back with “Nowhere.“I don’t have a house. I sold it to pay legal bills, so now I just travel. I live in hotels, airbnbs, on friends’ couches. Fighting the machine is not cheap, and they’re trying to bankrupt me.” • READ MORE: Edinburgh book festival chief hits out at visa issues facing international writersAnother front in McGowan’s fight against misogyny comes in the shape of the face cream she has developed with her aunt. It sounds unlikely at first, why is she dabbling in face cream? Yet as she talks you see her logic. “I want to disrupt the beauty industry,” she says. This is the woman who back in 2015 cut off her “long, glossy Kardashian-esque hair. I thought I looked more like a blow-up sex doll… I had been turned into the ultimate fantasy f*** toy by the Hollywood machine. I was dying on the inside and embarrassed by what I looked like on the outside.” And shorn of her hair, the real McGowan came out fighting. “And everyone complains about unrealistic beauty standards, but nobody really looks at it from a class point of view. I think it’s deeply classist, that if you don’t want chemicals you have to pay $150. It’s all part of the bigger scheme, of the way they keep women down. You pay them less and charge them more.“I’ve found an amazing laboratory that’s not connected to the expensive companies, to make an amazing product, that’s natural, and unisex.”And because this is McGowan we’re talking about, it’s not just dewy skin she’s after, there’s a bigger goal. “Ten per cent of the income is going to a centre which will provide long-term care for victims of violence, and I want some day to start a spa staffed by domestic violence and human trafficking victims. When people’s finances and self-esteem have been torn apart, they have no idea how to operate in the world but we can set them up so they can train others. So it becomes kind of like a school, that’s the company I’m building,” she says.“I hope to keep changing the world and do good for others. And make great art.” And when she sees the lengths people have gone to to try and shut her up…...“they’re still going,” she says.But she’s still going too...“Yep.”...does she ever feel overwhelmed? “Sometimes I get overwhelmed... a little. But the only way to change things is to lift the blanket and shine a light on the darkness. My goal is to expose Hollywood for what it really is. I have a million more stories I could tell in this book, but I don’t have the energy to document all of the dickery.” She laughs, exasperated, but determined. “In the book I say I’m like a phoenix and with this book, I rose again.”• Rose McGowan with Afua Hirsch is at the Edinburgh International Book Festival on Monday, Baillie Gifford Main Theatre, 3:15pm, £12, (£10).

Watching the cosy Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing programme the other night, in which these national comedy treasures discuss and compare heart operations, I felt compelled to search the internet for a previous Fast Show character whose name I couldn’t remember.            Eventually, I managed to track down Indecisive Dave, played by Whitehouse in the early 90s.            The nub of these sketches is based on a guy who offers an opinion on something, say the England football team or crime, then changes his mind as soon as someone challenges him.It’s clear that Dave doesn’t really have strong opinions on anything and is just trying to keep his end up in the pub chat stakes with his mates – who are more decisive than him. Dave would probably fall into the ‘don’t know’ camp when it comes to things like referendums and voting at elections.The don’t knows are a group of people who have reached a certain stage in life where they’re happy to admit that they don’t know all or any of the answers.No less a figure than Socrates – the ancient Greek philosopher, not the Brazilian footballer who ended up playing for Garforth Town – was also big on the don’t knows.Quoted by Plato, he says: “I do not think that a thing could be such an evil for a man, as much as having a false opinion concerning the things about which our discussion is about.”            I would put myself firmly in the don’t-know camp on a range of issues, chief among them: how to solve the Israel/Palestine conflict, what a post-Brexit UK should look like, should Scotland be independent, why don’t we just use the Forth Road Bridge during roadworks, and will Rangers finish second in the Scottish Premiership this season. READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Age of Uncertainty may see SNP wipeout or a new TrumpIt’s liberating to admit you don’t know something, especially in an age when polarisation is taking place to the right and left of politics in the UK, Europe and the United States.The rise of the Scottish Twitterati has seen a host of commentators crawling out the woodwork. These bright, young (annoying) things will give a strong opinion on anything at a moment’s notice as soon as the BBC call. No sitting on the fence, no room for discussion or subtle nuance – no, in they jump, giving it the full Katie Hopkins before taking to Twitter to signpost their latest musings.             Being Scottish in this day and age calls for taking sides and shouting loudly – we don’t really do discussions, only arguments and fence-sitters need not apply.I’ve spent an inordinate amount of time arguing in pubs about subjects as diverse as: are tennis players fitter than footballers, who would win if Muhammad Ali fought Mike Tyson, is Easter Road Stadium in Leith, and could Rocky take the Terminator in a square go?As the pints flow, the voices rise to a crescendo nobody is listening to anyone else and whoever shouts the loudest is deemed the winner – it’s great fun but does little to increase understanding. It seems that this culture has taken over in Scottish society. Like most sons, I always ask my father for advice, probably too much. Only last week, I phoned him to ask what I thought about Jeremy Corbyn. This has led to me being mercilessly ribbed by mates who stick the “my dad says” label on any opinion I happen to give. Asking your dad is, for the most part, a good idea – unless your dad’s a serial killer or someone like Joseph Stalin, if that’s the case it would probably be better to ask your mum.             Clearly there are some things that nobody knows, but this doesn’t deter the foolhardy.Sports journalism, in particular, is one area where any amount of daft questions are permitted.“Do you think team X or player Y can win the league, match, cup, whatever?” is standard practice for your average hack. Of course, the real answer is almost always “don’t know” as the event hasn’t taken place. The late, great Celtic manager Jock Stein understood this more than most when he proclaimed: “Only a fool would try to predict the score in an Old Firm game.”READ MORE: Socrates has the answer to Scotland’s problemsBookies exist because we think we know something when we don’t. How many times did you hear someone proclaim, “I fancy Tiger Woods for the Open” last month or any other golfer for that matter. All well and good but there were 155 other competitors in that event.So, who is going to stand up for the don’t knows? Sir Vince Cable is being touted as starting an anti-Brexit Centrist Party but he’s an unlikely knight in shining armour, although he doesn’t seem to know much so that would probably make him an ideal candidate.It would be a good idea to have another political party at some point with a nice centrist position kind of like New Labour – before Tony Blair decided he was in the SAS. They could certainly sweep up the ‘don’t knows’ and provide a much-needed alternative.My message to everyone is give saying “don’t know” or “dinnae ken” a go.

Today Shell is celebrating 50 years of operations in the North Sea. But there isn\u0026#8217t really much to celebrate.                Fifty years ago, the oil industry already knew that climate change was a threat, yet they carried on regardless. The American Petroleum Institute had commissioned US scientists to look at the consequences of burning fossil fuels. In 1968 those scientists said that carbon dioxide was definitely a concern, that continuing to burn fossil fuels would lead to increases in temperature at the earth’s surface, and that significant temperature increase could lead to melting ice caps, rising seas, and potentially serious environmental damage worldwide.  They said “there seems to be no doubt that the potential damage to our environment could be severe.”  They said that 50 years ago.            And so began half a century of wilful denial. In the 1970s another oil company, Exxon, spent millions of dollars on newspaper ads trying to cast doubt on climate change.  Meanwhile the company’s own scientists were telling senior executives that climate change is real.             In 1998 Shell’s own scientists wrote an internal report warning that “by the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even to stabilise the situation.”Throughout the 1990s the oil companies worked together in the Global Climate Coalition, turning up at the UN climate conferences to try to make sure as little as possible was done to reduce climate pollution.  Since this coalition was discredited, oil companies have continued to fund organisations which deny climate change or lobby against action.Fifty years on from Shell’s start in the North Sea we are seeing the consequences of climate change all around the world.  We’ve just had the warmest and sunniest May-July period ever recorded in Scotland, massive wildfires in the western US and Canada, heatwaves declared national emergencies in Japan and North Korea, and a devastating drought in Australia.  Climate change is killing people and wrecking lives now.  Even if every country in the world does everything it has promised to reduce emissions – a very unlikely prospect - we will still reach a temperature rise twice the so-called safe limit by 2100, four times the temperature rise we have already seen to date.  We know that the world can only afford to burn less than a fifth of known global fossil fuel reserves.Yet Shell carry on as if they can continue to pump oil forever. If we are to have any chance of keeping the planet out of the extreme danger zone the oil companies must transform or die.  Exploring for new oil and gas needs to stop everywhere.  Current jobs in oil and gas need to become jobs in offshore and onshore renewables and energy efficiency.  We can do all this with strong leadership.  And we can do it with or without the oil companies.            Shareholders have challenged Shell to change at recent AGMs and now our sister organisation in the Netherlands is taking them to court to force the company to commit to a business model which helps the world meet the targets in the 2015 Paris Agreement, rather than ensuring we blow the global carbon budget in the next few years.  More than 20,000 people from 70 countries have signed up to support this legal action. The planet cannot afford to have Shell still exist in their current form in even another five years, let alone 50.Dr Richard Dixon is Director of Friends of the Earth Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4780268.1534171090!/image/image.jpg","title":"letters ignore the gloomy assessments scotland has highly educated population","story":"        Reports that spending on education in Scotland has fallen by \u0026#163400 million when compared to 2007 (Brian Wilson, 11 August) should be seen in context of ongoing Westminster real term cuts of \u0026#1633.3 billion to the Scottish budget.

Mr Corbyn has admitted being present at a ceremony for the Palestinian killers who carried out the Munich Olympics massacre.            But the Labour leader said he did not think he had been actually involved in the commemoration of members of Black September, who murdered 11 Israelis at the 1972 Olympics.            A tweet from the office of Israel’s prime minister said: “The laying of a wreath by Jeremy Corbyn on the graves of the terrorists who perpetrated the Munich massacre and his comparison of Israel to the Nazis deserves unequivocal condemnation from everyone – left, right and everything in between.”In response, the Labour leader tweeted: “Israeli PM @Netanyahu’s claims about my actions and words are false. What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children.”He added: “The nation state law sponsored by @Netanyahu’s government discriminates against Israel’s Palestinian minority. I stand with the tens of thousands of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel demonstrating for equal rights at the weekend in Tel Aviv.”Labour MPs have demanded an apology from Mr Corbyn after he admitted being present at the ceremony.The outcry came after pictures of Mr Corbyn holding a wreath during a visit in 2014 to a Tunisian cemetery emerged three days ago.            It was reported he visited graves of men behind the atrocity, including a senior Palestinian Liberation Organisation figure reportedly killed by Israeli agents in Paris in 1992. Labour had said he had been at the cemetery to pay his respects at a separate memorial to those killed in a 1985 Israeli air strike on PLO offices in Tunis. But Mr Corbyn told Sky News yesterday: “A wreath was indeed laid by some of those who attended the conference of those who were killed in Paris in 1992.”Asked whether he was involved in the wreath-laying, he said: “I was present when it was laid. I don’t think I was actually involved in it.”            Mr Corbyn added: “I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it. You cannot pursue peace by a cycle of violence.” The photographs prompted fresh attacks by Labour MPs, who have already accused him of failing to take tough enough action to stamp out anti-Semitism in the party."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783451.1534182117!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish government offers bridging loans to farmers following extreme weather","story":"        Loans to help farmers hit by months of adverse weather are being offered by the Scottish Government.                The National Basic Payment Support Scheme was launched yesterday by Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing.            Under the scheme, loans will be made available to eligible farmers of up to 90% of the value of their annual payment from the European Union.            While that money would usually be handed over between December and June, the loan payments are expected to be made to eligible farmers from early October.It follows a run of difficult weather for farmers in 2018, with “the Beast from the East” cold spell followed by a heatwave this summer.Mr Ewing said: “Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and we understand that many of them have really suffered this year due to the unprecedented severe weather experienced in 2018.“The Scottish Government is of course committed to supporting our farmers and have responded by taking decisive action to make this extra funding stream available.“We will be issuing loan offers shortly, providing a much-needed cash injection for those feeling the effects of increased prices for feed and fodder, the impact of restraints on irrigating their land and in some cases resorting to selling livestock earlier than planned to preserve fodder for breeding stocks.”            Mr Ewing said he had also asked experts to consider what other actions may be helpful in response to the recent dry weather.The funding will be available on an opt-in basis, with individual loan offers expected to be sent to farmers from early September.A similar scheme created last year delivered payments of more than £317 million to around 13,500 farmers, the Government said.Scottish Labour’s rural economy spokesman, Colin Smyth, said: “This long overdue announcement is welcome but doesn’t go far enough. Farmers have been warning of a crisis for months now, with grass growth at a standstill and hay and silage crops in some cases just half the normal level.            “The shortages and spiralling prices for feed is hitting all sectors and both the Scottish and UK governments have to step up and do more.”There are also concerns that the cash announced yesterday does not cover crucial Pillar 2 payments and Labour is calling on ministers to bring forward the payment of these schemes as a “matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783461.1534184179!/image/image.jpg","title":"745m aberdeen bypass moves closer as seven mile stretch opens to motorists","story":"        The long-awaited Aberdeen bypass will take a step closer to completion with the opening of the most northern stretch of the \u0026#163745 million road on Wednesday.                The seven-mile road from Balmedie to Tipperty, representing about a fifth of the total route, will be the second stretch to start taking traffic.            The road was initially scheduled for completion in spring this year, but the collapse of builders Carillion was among the problems that pushed it back initially to the summer, then to the autumn.            The 4.3-mile section of the bypass between Parkhill and Blackdog opened recently.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: “We said we would open new sections of road as soon as they were ready for traffic and we are delivering on that commitment. “This will be very welcome news to the local community, road users and businesses who have been so patient while these works have been ongoing. We thank them for their continued support.“Every day tens of thousands of drivers will now begin to reap the benefits of this section of new road, which was originally a separate project to the AWPR (Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route), through enhanced safety, reduced congestion, improved journey time reliability and safer access to local areas and the wider public network.“The full benefits of this huge project will be realised when the AWPR/B-T opens in late autumn 2018.             “Our investment in this project is expected to bring in an additional £6 billion to the north-east economy and create around 14,000 jobs over the next 30 years.”All remaining cones on the new section of road will be removed and the national speed limit returned on this section of the A90, with reduced speed limits in place on slip roads. Construction works will continue on some side roads and access roads.Temporary lanes and road space were among the measures used in construction to minimise disruption.             The new stretch includes three junctions, approximately 5.5 miles of dual carriageway between Balmedie and Bridgend, as well as two miles of improvements to the dual carriageway between Blackdog and Balmedie.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said it was a “significant step” for the scheme.“We believe it will bring huge benefits to Aberdeen by enabling faster journey times for commuters and help us to unlock the economic potential of the wider north-east region,” she added.Aberdeenshire councillor Jim Gifford said the opening of the road was “very pleas-\u2028ing.“As well as improving access to communities along the A90, the development brings some welcome additional capacity on what is an important route for commuting and business traffic,” he said.            “It also brings us a step closer to the conclusion of the AWPR/B-T project and it is now even easier to visualise how the development will improve access and journey times across the north-east.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nTuesday 14 Aug 2018 4:40 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law. Those concerned about possible wildcat kittens seen alone without their mother should not disturb them but back off quietly, observe carefully and seek expert advice.\n\"Mum could be put off from returning to the den if people intervene.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Park , and as such, we wanted to maximise our offering to would-be clients.\n  \nHaving noticed an increase in the number of couples opting for a civil ceremony rather than a church wedding, we decided to add on a purpose-built wedding pavilion away from the hustle and bustle of the main hotel.\n  \n“Thanks to the financial support received from Ulster Bank, the pavilion itself has been finished to an exceptionally high standard and its many unique features make it the perfect location for any couple to tie the knot.”\n  \nAndy Tew, Business Development Manager with Ulster Bank said

compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

They know the Cadet movement is as much committed to building confidence and friendships as it is to building skills.\n\n“Our Banbridge Cadets embraced every opportunity brought to them at this year’s Summer Camp, held at Strensall, near York, with great good humour and seemingly boundless energy. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Now, following a Summer packed with challenge and achievement, they’ll be turning their attention to their annual new membership campaign and I am sure they will all become highly persuasive recruiters as they invite local teenagers to come along and see what Cadet life has to offer.”\n\nIf you would like to find out more about what membership of the Army, Sea or Air Cadets can offer you or your children, contact 0800 730 730 or visit www.reservesandcadetsni.org.uk.

Then,  around 300 workers,   mostly women,  losing their jobs.\n\nThe Business Centre  wants to compile a multi-media history project, recording the workers’ experiences. They want people who worked there to join a reminiscence/oral history project to record what it was like in the factory during the 1950’s, 60’s and 70’s, and the impact its closure had.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “The intention would be for the former workers to meet on a regular basis over coming months and to talk and chat about their times in Mayfair. It will be very informal and a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“We intend that the project will be very much led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places in the town as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair, which will not only include the video-recorded interviews but also old photo’s and other items.”\n\nAnyone interested in joining the project should contact Ursula Kearns at Mayfair by telephone on 028 38 391666 or email ursula@mayfairbusinesscentre\n\nThe Tyrone-based BEAM Creative Networks will help facilitate delivery of the project and provide video-recording, design and other support. The present Mayfair Business Centre was established in 1995 as a community-owned enterprise and officially opened in 1996. The Business Centre has gone through a number of phases of development in the intervening years.  It has proven to be a success with twenty-eight businesses occupying a total of 38 units in the Mayfair complex - around 48,000 sq ft of space.\n\nMatch-funding for this project has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8594231.1533722568!/image/image.jpg","title":"ulster bank to hold local drop in clinics","story":"\nUlster Bank has appointed a new Community Banker in the Co. Down and Lisburn area to help support local customers with a wide range of banking services.\n\n                \nRichard Gill is one of a team of Community Bankers who have been appointed to communities in small towns and rural areas across Northern Ireland to help customers with their everyday banking needs, educate on financial health and to host regular information sessions.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nRecognising the importance of bank services in the local community, the Community Banker roles are unique to Ulster Bank. The team will be available to assist customers, including the elderly and vulnerable, with information and hands-on support for digital banking services. To cater for the individual needs of the every member of the community, the team can also provide guidance on the bank’s Post Office service, its telephone banking system and its Bank on Wheels.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThroughout the year Richard will be organising a series of events open to the public as well as delivering presentations for schools and community organisations about the importance of staying safe and secure when banking, good practice for identifying fraud and scams, using the Ulster Bank Anytime Banking app and transitioning from traditional to digital banking services.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nCommunity Banker Richard Gill explained: “I’m really looking forward to engaging with people right across Co. Down and being an active part of this community.\n\n“Being financially fit, aware of how to keep your money safe and secure, and feeling confident in using digital technologies are important skills, and the events I’m planning to run will reflect that.”\n\nRichard will host regular drop-in clinics in Rathfriland and Dromore and on call to help customers Monday to Friday, between 9am and 5pm. For more information or to book an appointment, contact Richard on 07901518863 or by emailing richard.gill@ulsterbank.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37210592.ece/a626a/AUTOCROP/w65square/_0608ks18_521.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"closing of roads is a serious matter council defends decision not to allow run","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

PICTURE MATT BOHILL PACEMAKER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSDLP policing and justice spokesperson Dolores Kelly said: \"The Omagh bombing was the worst atrocity to take place during our 30 year conflict. For Julia Hartley-Brewer to play politics with this issue is indefensible then to go on and claim it is some sort of attempt at satire is outrageous.\"\n\n\nBREAKING: \n@jeremycorbyn\n makes statement on the 20th anniversary of the \n#Omagh\n bomb today, paying tribute to the many dead and injured, including the Real IRA bombers who may have snagged a nail while planting the explosives. \npic.twitter/DDMt7ZGlpq\n\n— Julia Hartley-Brewer (@JuliaHB1) \nAugust 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to the Belfast , Alliance Party MLA Stephen Farry said: \"I am a critic of Jeremy Corbyn in many respects. But to tweet something like this in some of stupid little game shows how low Ms Hartley-Brewer is prepared to stoop.\n\n\"The Omagh bomb was the single biggest atrocity in the history of the Troubles. I would ask her to apologise for attempting to use it in such a way.\"\n\nThe tweet was posted on Sunday, which marked the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bomb.\n\nMemorials took place in the Tyrone town and across the province for the 29 people - including a woman pregnant with twins - who died in the 1998 Real IRA attack.\n\n\n\n\nMan who lost wife in Omagh bombing reveals agony in aftermath of the atrocity - \u0027I feel robbed of the life me and Ann could have had\u0027\n\n\n\n\n\n20 years on, Omagh remembers the 31 lives lost in worst Troubles atrocity\n \n\n\n\nResponding to the tweet many social media users took issue with the use of a picture of the Omagh bomb, and using the event to criticise the Labour leader.\n\nResponding to the tweet, writer of the hit Channel 4 programme Derry Girls Lisa McGee said: \"I cannot believe you thought it was acceptable to use this photograph in this way.\"\n\nSky News Ireland correspondent David Blevins also reacted to the tweet, writing: \"Julia, how long did you spend thinking about the dead and their incredibly dignified families before deciding that the 20th anniversary of Northern Ireland\u0027s worst single atrocity was the stuff of satire?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia, how long did you spend thinking about the dead and their incredibly dignified families before deciding that the 20th anniversary of Northern Ireland\u0027s worst single atrocity was the stuff of satire? \nhttps://t.co/G5wfSAzhwM\n\n— David Blevins (@skydavidblevins) \nAugust 12, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAnother user, who said they were a member of the Labour party, wrote: \"I am from Omagh. I am sick, hurt, and appalled that anyone could make political points out of the destruction of my lovely home town and 29 innocent people who died that day.\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Mrs Hartley-Brewer wrote: \"The fact that some people - even journos - can believe this tweet is true, and not satire, shows just how low our expectations of @jeremycorbyn are. He has repeatedly paid tribute to dead terrorists so why should today be any different?\"\n\nIn the wake of the tweet a fake news story emerged online claiming Mrs Hartley-Brewer had been sacked from her position, Mrs Hartley-Brewer responded to by saying: \"I’m gutted, to be honest.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein to review internal structures after","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Age, says it has left an imprint on the genes of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish Astronomy Society chairman David Moore (PA)\n\n\n\n\n“In the Stone Age, Irish people were watching the motion of sun and moon, and built Newgrange to establish the first calendar.\n\n“A 200,000 tonne monument, that’s like building Dublin city, without a single mechanical tool, and it saved their lives, they knew there was 365 days a year, even down to the extra quarter of a day.\n\n“They were very advanced for their time and technology.”\n\nOne of Ireland’s leading astronomy speakers Kevin Nolan spoke in Trinity College on Monday about Ireland’s future in the field.\n\nIrish projects currently under way include production of data to investigate the origin of the universe, black holes, and even the threat of impacts of asteroids on the Earth.\n\nThe lecture Big Data Big Universe looked at how the revolution in computer technology in Ireland is applied to huge cutting-edge projects in space.\n\nMr Moore added that Ireland, one of the leading science-based economies on the planet, is now offering better studying opportunities for young people interested in astronomy.\n\n“We have a huge science-based economy, 60% of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Nolan, coordinator of the Irish Planetary Society and lecturer at ITT (David Moore)\n\n\n\n\n“The budget last year was the most important budget in the history of the Irish state, and it should keep Ireland on the map for a lifetime.\n\n“Last year the Government funded getting Ireland involved in building the world’s biggest telescope, and gave more funding for science in general.\n\n“We used to tell young people interested in astronomy to emigrate, there’s nothing here for them.\n\n“Now, it’s a brilliant place to study astronomy.\n\n“The big tech companies will be screaming for science graduates in their highest paid jobs.\n\n“Recently Kevin Nolan’s team at IT Tallaght processed the huge SDSS catalogue of half a billion objects in deep sky to allow stars with planets orbiting them to be more easily found.\n\n“Researchers in UCD have set up a company to process data from space, Parameter Space Ltd.\n\n“It’s very important for our economy, and it’s a brilliant subject to get young people interested in.\n\n“We should be looking for all scientists to come to Ireland, when Britain leave the EU especially, there’s a lot happening here to be involved in.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mediation talks between ryanair and trade union under way","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Committee, has set aside three days for the negotiations.\n\nThe dispute resulted in a fifth day of strike action on Friday.\n\nAbout 100 of Ryanair’s 350 Irish-based pilots joined colleagues in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden in a series of strikes.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe airline said 396 flights were cancelled as a result, disrupting thousands of passengers.\n\nA spokesman for Forsa said Mr Mulvey had asked both parties to refrain from public comment while the process is under way.\n\nA Ryanair spokesman said mediation was required after five strikes failed to achieve “anything other than to regrettably disrupt some customers”.\n\nHe added 95% of the airline’s flights and the majority of its pilots had operated on those days.\n\n“Mediation should ensure Forsa takes control of their side of the process, take these negotiations more seriously and remove unwanted interference,” the spokesman said.\n\n“Talks, not strikes, will move this forward and allow Ryanair to make the same progress we are making with other unions elsewhere in Europe.”\n\nForsa has not served notice of further strike action while the process of mediation is under way.\n\nUnion representative Bernard Harbor told RTE Radio One’s Morning Ireland programme that there was a lot of ground to be made up and a lot of time had been wasted.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"us vulture fund to buy 14bn euro of ulster bank","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

5,200 non-performing mortgage loans to Cerberus Capital Management.\n\nThe portfolio includes about 2,300 residential loans and around 2,900 buy-to-let mortgages.\n\n\n\nThis difficult decision comes a decade after the financial crisis began and the continued extension of forbearance cannot be maintained\nUlster Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nA bank spokeswoman said: “Ulster Bank can now confirm that it has agreed terms for the sale of a portfolio of non-performing mortgages of c 1.4 billion euro, as announced for sale in May to a purchaser managed by affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management LP.\n\n“This portfolio does not contain any performing home loans or any home loans in an arrangement.\n\n“This difficult decision comes a decade after the financial crisis began and the continued extension of forbearance cannot be maintained.\n\n“Not all mortgages are sustainable and we are obliged to reduce the level of non-performing loans on our balance sheet.\n\n“For mortgages that are not sustainable, additional forbearance will not bring them back to a performing position.”\n\n\n\nThe net effect of the transaction remains that another bank is outsourcing its dirty work to a US vulture fund\nFianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nUlster Bank said it would be contacting affected customers and giving 90 days’ notice of the sale instead of the 60 days it was required to provide.\n\nFianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath criticised the sale.\n\n“The net effect of the transaction remains that another bank is outsourcing its dirty work to a US vulture fund,” Mr McGrath said.\n\n“What tools does Cerberus have at its disposal for dealing with these loans that Ulster Bank doesn’t have?\n\n“The bottom line here is the banks and the Government are simply washing their hands of the problem.”\n\nThe opposition TD said it was hard to see many of these mortgage holders managing to negotiate a restructuring solution with the bank and that Ulster Bank needed to clarify whether the mortgages were being purchased by a regulated or unregulated entity.\n\nSinn Fein TD David Cullinane said the raft of loan sales by banks during the Dail recess showed “they have the implicit acceptance of Government”.\n\nMr Cullinane claimed a “banks-first” policy had been adopted by Finance Minister Paschal Donohue in line with his predecessor Michael Noonan.\n\n“While Ulster Bank say no performing loans are included, this does not exclude the possibility that mortgages meeting their restructuring arrangement are included – this must be clarified immediately,” he said.\n\n“Without political direction this summer will be remembered as the Summer of the Vultures.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"baby born in traffic caused by overturned coach on motorway","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Where is the apology?\n\nThe widows of the Israeli athletes said they were “extremely disturbed” by claims about the visit.\n\nConservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the row showed Mr Corbyn was “unfit for senior public office, never mind his position as the official Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition”.\n\nWriting in Tuesday’s Daily Mail, Mr Lewis said that “decent” Labour members should be questioning whether Mr Corbyn should continue to lead “a party that has long fought to promote anti-racism and social justice”.\n\nMr Lewis added: “At such a crucial time for Britain’s future, this cannot continue. I feel only foreboding.”\n\nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: “Jeremy did not lay any wreath at the graves of those alleged to have been linked to the Black September organisation or the 1972 Munich killings.\n\n“He of course condemns that terrible attack, as he does the 1985 bombing.”\n\nMr Corbyn said last year he had spoken at the conference and “I laid a wreath to all those that had died in the air attack that took place on Tunis, on the headquarters of the Palestinian organisations there”.\n\nWriting in the Morning Star at the time of the visit, Mr Corbyn said wreaths had been laid not only at the memorial, but also “on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991”.\n\nThe pictures emerged amid continuing controversy over Labour’s refusal to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, including a list of examples of anti-Semitic behaviour.\n\nLabour launched a consultation with Jewish groups over the code, after protests that the version agreed by the party’s ruling National Executive Committee omits four examples relating to criticism of the state of Israel.\n\nMr Corbyn said on Monday that Labour’s version of code was the “most sophisticated” of any political party.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"israeli pm blasts labour leader corbyn over palestinian remembrance event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association \u0026 support. There can also never be a “fitting memorial” for terrorists.

2018\n\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn reiterated that Mr Corbyn was paying his respects to the victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis.\n\nHe added: “Jeremy did not lay any wreath at the graves of those alleged to have been linked to the Black September organisation or the 1972 Munich killings.\n\n“He of course condemns that terrible attack, as he does the 1985 bombing.”\n\nMr Corbyn said last year he had spoken at the conference and “I laid a wreath to all those that had died in the air attack that took place on Tunis, on the headquarters of the Palestinian organisations there”.\n\nWriting in The Morning Star at the time of the visit, Mr Corbyn said that wreaths had been laid not only at the memorial, but also “on the graves of others killed by Mossad agents in Paris in 1991”.\n\nThe pictures emerged amid continuing controversy over Labour’s refusal to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, including a list of examples of anti-Semitic behaviour.\n\nLabour launched a consultation with Jewish groups over the code, after protests that the version agreed by the party’s ruling National Executive Committee omits four examples relating to criticism of the state of Israel.\n\nThree senior union leaders added their voices to calls from deputy leader Tom Watson for the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance text to be incorporated in its entirety into Labour’s new code of conduct on anti-Semitism.\n\nBut Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, who sits on the NEC, said he voted for the code because it is an advance on the original document.\n\nMr Corbyn said the Labour’s version of code was the “most sophisticated” of any political party.\n\nHe told reporters: “The one example that we are discussing and consulting on is one that makes sure that you can discuss and debate the relations between Israel and Palestine, the future of the peace process and, yes, make criticisms of the actions of the Israeli government in the bombing of Gaza and other places.\n\n“But you can never make those criticisms using anti-Semitic language or anti-Semitic intentions, and that is what we are absolutely clear on.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"13 times peoples twitter timeline perfectly aligned to deliver","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n

Many analysts say that is not likely, but it has caused sharp losses for stocks.\n\nOn Monday Turkey’s central bank announced measures to help the country’s banks, but the Turkish lira and Turkey’s stock market continued to slide.\n\nThe lira has been tumbling as investors question whether the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can cope with problems including the weakening currency and a diplomatic spat with Washington that has resulted in higher US tariffs.\n\nMr Erdogan has ruled out higher interest rates, which can slow economic growth, but independent analysts say higher rates are urgently needed to stabilise the country’s currency. His refusal is one of several factors worrying investors.\n\nInvestors also backed away from Argentina’s stock market. The Argentinian peso sank to an all-time low amid investor caution and a local corruption scandal involving former government officials.\n\nWhile Turkey and Argentina face different political situations, the currencies of both countries have tumbled to all-time lows against the dollar, partly because rising interest rates in the US lure investors to take money out of their markets and move it to the US.\n\nThe dollar is the strongest it has been in more than a year, which could eventually create problems for companies that make a lot of sales overseas.\n\nTerry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said the dollar has strengthened because economic growth has picked up and other regions are not doing as well.\n\n“The US is a relative beacon of strength with stable to improving economy. That suggests a stronger dollar,” he said.\n\nThe S\u0026P 500 index lost 11.35 points, or 0.4%, to 2,821.93 after a drop of 0.7% on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 125.44 points, or 0.5%, to 25,187.70.\n\nEnergy and industrial companies and basic materials companies took some of the worst losses. Technology companies held up better.\n\nThe Nasdaq composite fell 19.40 points, or 0.2%, to 7,819.71, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 11.49 points, or 0.7%, to 1,675.32.\n\nInvestors are worried about a confluence of factors including Turkey’s reliance on foreign loans, which become more difficult to repay when the country’s currency is plunging. Also, a diplomatic spat with the US is resulting in sharply higher tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium.\n\nAfter a year-long stretch where much of the global economy was speeding up together and stocks were rising, the losses for Turkey and Argentina have caused emerging market indexes to fall out of favour.\n\nStocks were on a five-week winning streak before last week, and strong corporate earnings reports were a big factor, but most of those reports are done, and Mr Sandven said stocks may spend the next two months wavering.\n\nIn corporate news, German conglomerate Bayer took a dive after a US jury ruled against its Monsanto unit Friday and awarded 289 million dollars to a former school groundskeeper who said that exposure to Monsanto’s Roundup weed killer caused cancer. Monsanto said government agencies and hundreds of studies have concluded Roundup is safe.\n\nTrading in Germany, Bayer tumbled 10.3%.\n\nMotorcycle maker Harley-Davidson fell 4.3% to 41.38 dollars after President Donald Trump tweeted in support of a potential boycott of its products.\n\nMr Trump has been criticising the company since June, when it said it would move more manufacturing out of the US to avoid European tariffs. The EU put new taxes on US motorcycles in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs on products imported from Europe.\n\nUS crude oil fell 0.6% to 67.20 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude lost 0.3% to 72.61 dollars a barrel in London.\n\nNielsen Holdings jumped 12.1% to 24.62 dollars after Elliott Management, a firm run by activist investor Paul Singer, disclosed an ownership stake and said Nielsen should consider selling itself or some of its assets to boost its stock price.\n\nNielsen stock has been sinking since it traded over 50 dollars two years ago.\n\nMost retailers were down, but Amazon advanced 0.5% to 1,896.20 dollars. It passed travel website Booking Holdings to become the highest-priced stock on the S\u0026P 500.\n\nIn other energy trading, wholesale petrol dipped 1.2% to 2.01 dollars a gallon, heating oil lost 0.1% to 2.14 dollars a gallon, and natural gas slid 0.5% to 2.93 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold dropped 1.6% to 1,198.90 dollars an ounce, its lowest price since January 2017.

The Mayor’s office is continuing to work along with the festival organisers to secure other contributors from the across the political spectrum on these islands.”\n\nProfessor Paul Arthur, Chair of the Civil Rights Commemoration, said: “We have tried to make the Civil Rights Festival in Derry as inclusive and reflective as the times demands. We are aware that in the midst of the Decade of Commemorations (and indeed the eighteenth months of the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly) this is the 70th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the 20th Anniversary of the Belfast Agreement. We are aware too that in the context of deeply polarized global politics, creating a climate conducive to human rights is no easy task.\n\n“We hope that the programme has begun to address the malign legacy of the Troubles by recognizing that the Civil Rights movement has been an amalgam of the generational, class, gender and ideological struggles that continue to face issues such as spatial segregation, racism, sectarianism and challenges to the LGBT, travelling and migrant communities.\n\n “We want to move away from the adversarial debate of ‘them’ and ‘us’ by creating a dialogue of recognition and reciprocity. It is appropriate that we are bringing this together in Derry - the site of that historic event fifty years ago - a truly seminal moment in the struggle for civil rights.”\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk//resources/images/8152159.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"oswestry show 2018 ready for thousands of
