deals that helped bring in new users and, as a result, drove up its advertising revenue. Facebook\u0027s \u0027People You May Know\u0027, a friend suggestion tool on the site, was one such feature in which the social media giant utilized data acquired by its partners. The tool has been controversial since it was introduced in 2008, sometimes suggesting connections between estranged family members or even a victim and their harasser.   Facebook\u0027s business partners were exempted from the site\u0027s usual privacy rules through the deals, according to internal records. The deals - made with tech businesses, online retailers, automakers, entertainment sites, and media organizations - date back to 2010 and all were still active in 2017. Some still remained in effect this year, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal plagued Facebook and raised numerous concerns about how it was handling its users\u0027 data. Following the controversy, Zuckerberg told Congress in April that Facebook users now \u0027have complete control\u0027 over everything they share on the site.           Amazon was allowed to obtain users\u0027 names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends\u0027 postsBut an extensive investigation by the Times has revealed that wasn\u0027t the case as it interviewed more than 50 former Facebook employees and government officials and reviewed more than 270 pages of the company\u0027s internal documents. The Times also performed a number of technical tests to determine exactly what information was being passed between Facebook to its partner websites. Facebook made deals with over 60 makers of smartphones, including Apple. Records show that Apple devices could access users\u0027 contact numbers and calendar entries, even if those same users had disabled all sharing. Apple was also given the ability to hide the fact that its devices were asking for data from Facebook\u0027s users. And Yandex, a Russian social media company  accused of having ties to the Kremlin, could access Facebook users\u0027 unique IDs as recently as 2017 - despite the fact that Facebook had stopped sharing them with other applications for years due to security concerns. Facebook began dabbling in data sharing in 2009, suddenly making some of the information of 400 million of its users available to all of the World Wide Web. It also began sharing information about its users, including their locations and religion, to partners such as Microsoft. Facebook claimed this practice - which it dubbed \u0027instant personalization\u0027 - would help customize the internet to people\u0027s preferences and make the online world a more enjoyable and personal experience for everyone. But the FTC soon caught wind of what Facebook was doing and found that the social media giant had defied promises to keep its users\u0027 information private. Facebook entered into the consent agreement with the FTC, even hiring chief privacy officers and auditor Privewaterhouse Coopers to oversee its practices. But still, records show, the deals that Facebook had made with major companies persisted. Some were even vetted by Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Two years after the consent agreement, Facebook had agreed to so many partnerships that a tool was built to turn this special access on and off.            The shocking expose comes as Sheryl Sandberg (pictured Tuesday) was doing damage control after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential electionFormer employees revealed that the same privacy team touted to the FTC only had a limited ability to review these data-sharing partnerships. Facebook has claimed that most of these data partnerships were exempted from the FTC agreement because they were only working \u0027for and at the direction of\u0027 the social media site.   But that claim has been disputed by a number of former FTC officials.\u0027The only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth in an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u0027 said former FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani. \u0027This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u0027 added David Vladeck, who ran the FTC consumer protection bureau. \u0027I don\u0027t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u0027 Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says the company needs to do...Mark Zuckerberg lost $15BILLION during a year of...Share this articleA Netflix spokesman said: \u0027Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social.

At no time did we access people\u0027s private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so.\u0027 The shocking expose comes as it was revealed that Zuckerberg has lost almost a quarter of his net worth following a year of scandals at the site. Meanwhile, Sandberg has been doing damage control this week after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.\u0027Facebook is committed to working with leading US civil rights organizations to strengthen and advance civil rights on our service.

deals that helped bring in new users and, as a result, drove up its advertising revenue. Facebook\u0027s \u0027People You May Know\u0027, a friend suggestion tool on the site, was one such feature in which the social media giant utilized data acquired by its partners. The tool has been controversial since it was introduced in 2008, sometimes suggesting connections between estranged family members or even a victim and their harasser.   Facebook\u0027s business partners were exempted from the site\u0027s usual privacy rules through the deals, according to internal records. The deals - made with tech businesses, online retailers, automakers, entertainment sites, and media organizations - date back to 2010 and all were still active in 2017. Some still remained in effect this year, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal plagued Facebook and raised numerous concerns about how it was handling its users\u0027 data. Following the controversy, Zuckerberg told Congress in April that Facebook users now \u0027have complete control\u0027 over everything they share on the site.           Amazon was allowed to obtain users\u0027 names and contact information through their friends, and Yahoo could view streams of friends\u0027 postsBut an extensive investigation by the Times has revealed that wasn\u0027t the case as it interviewed more than 50 former Facebook employees and government officials and reviewed more than 270 pages of the company\u0027s internal documents. The Times also performed a number of technical tests to determine exactly what information was being passed between Facebook to its partner websites. Facebook made deals with over 60 makers of smartphones, including Apple. Records show that Apple devices could access users\u0027 contact numbers and calendar entries, even if those same users had disabled all sharing. Apple was also given the ability to hide the fact that its devices were asking for data from Facebook\u0027s users. And Yandex, a Russian social media company  accused of having ties to the Kremlin, could access Facebook users\u0027 unique IDs as recently as 2017 - despite the fact that Facebook had stopped sharing them with other applications for years due to security concerns. Facebook began dabbling in data sharing in 2009, suddenly making some of the information of 400 million of its users available to all of the World Wide Web. It also began sharing information about its users, including their locations and religion, to partners such as Microsoft. Facebook claimed this practice - which it dubbed \u0027instant personalization\u0027 - would help customize the internet to people\u0027s preferences and make the online world a more enjoyable and personal experience for everyone. But the FTC soon caught wind of what Facebook was doing and found that the social media giant had defied promises to keep its users\u0027 information private. Facebook entered into the consent agreement with the FTC, even hiring chief privacy officers and auditor Privewaterhouse Coopers to oversee its practices. But still, records show, the deals that Facebook had made with major companies persisted. Some were even vetted by Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. Two years after the consent agreement, Facebook had agreed to so many partnerships that a tool was built to turn this special access on and off.            The shocking expose comes as Sheryl Sandberg (pictured Tuesday) was doing damage control after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential electionFormer employees revealed that the same privacy team touted to the FTC only had a limited ability to review these data-sharing partnerships. Facebook has claimed that most of these data partnerships were exempted from the FTC agreement because they were only working \u0027for and at the direction of\u0027 the social media site.   But that claim has been disputed by a number of former FTC officials.\u0027The only common theme is that they are partnerships that would benefit the company in terms of development or growth in an area that they otherwise could not get access to,\u0027 said former FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani. \u0027This is just giving third parties permission to harvest data without you being informed of it or giving consent to it,\u0027 added David Vladeck, who ran the FTC consumer protection bureau. \u0027I don\u0027t understand how this unconsented-to data harvesting can at all be justified under the consent decree.\u0027 Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says the company needs to do...Mark Zuckerberg lost $15BILLION during a year of...Share this articleA Netflix spokesman said: \u0027Over the years we have tried various ways to make Netflix more social.

At no time did we access people\u0027s private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so.\u0027 The shocking expose comes as it was revealed that Zuckerberg has lost almost a quarter of his net worth following a year of scandals at the site. Meanwhile, Sandberg has been doing damage control this week after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.\u0027Facebook is committed to working with leading US civil rights organizations to strengthen and advance civil rights on our service.

As part of the blueprint: Migrants must earn at least £30,000 before they are allowed to come to Britain on five-year-long visas.But foreign workers on lower pay could be allowed in where occupations facing shortages or if they work for tech start-ups.Low-skilled migrants can get \u0027temporary\u0027 one-year visas if they have jobs – but once the permit expires they must leave the country for at least 12 months. To stop crops rotting in fields, farmers could hire low-skilled workers on seasonal visas. Freedom of movement for people will end, fulfilling a manifesto commitment. The controversial net migration target of 100,000 looked set to be axed – a move Mrs May resisted. Instead, levels are likely to be \u0027sustainable\u0027. As he unveiled the plans this morning, Mr Javid effectively axed the \u0027tens of thousands\u0027 promise on immigration as he unveiled long-delayed reforms to border rules.The Home Secretary refused seven times to repeat the target in an extraordinary interview this morning - and confirmed it does not feature in post-Brexit plans due to be published later.Instead he insisted the goal is to achieve \u0027sustainable\u0027 levels of immigration.The shift will be seen as a fresh blow to the authority of the PM, as she struggles to cling on amid a storm over her Brexit deal.Mrs May has been a champion of the Tory target for bringing net annual immigration below 100,000, which was first declared a decade ago when David Cameron was leader.But they have never come to close to meeting the aim. In the most recent figures, net arrivals were running at 273,000 a year.  Mr Javid  said: \u0027There is no specific target. It will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels,\u0027 he said.\u0027If you look at the current level of migration, the latest stats show 273,000. Most people agree that is very high, certainly by historical standards.\u0027In the last two decades it has been in the hundreds of thousands. If you go back further than that it was much lower.\u0027What we want to do is bring it to a level where it is sustainable, in the sense that it meets first our economic need and at the same time, though, it is not too high a burden on our communities or on our infrastructure.\u0027          Net immigration to Britain rose to 273,000 in the first half of 2018 despite a continued fall in arrivals from the EU according to ONS data out today (pictured). The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill will crack down on welfare payments claimed by EU workers arriving after the end of December 2021.Under current Brussels rules, EU workers arriving under free movement rules can claim the same benefits as UK citizens.Official data from before the 2016 Brexit referendum showed that EU workers received more than £2.2billion in tax credits and housing benefits, £1.1billion in out-of-work payments and £700million in child benefit.But non-EU nationals on visas are not allowed to claim until they been given leave to remain or settlement – typically after about five years.EU citizens and their families who are already in Britain before the transition date will still be able to claim benefits."},{"url":null,"title":"Im mane man Lion looks pleased mates lioness","story":"    Rampant: The lions rocks back on its hind quarters as it grins down at the lioness who looks back at him, lying on her back, as the pair prepare to mate in Maasai Mara National Reserve in the south east of Kenya          The lion bears its teeth as it sits at the rear of the lioness on the grassy plains of the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya although mating itself takes only a few seconds, it is repeated about every 20 minutesSafari ranger is crushed to death by sexually charged bull...Nearly 45,000 people sign a petition accusing Disney of...From flying squirrels and the real-life Lion King to...Share this article    The lion roars and the female roars back at him as he prepares to mount when lionesses are ready to mate they will raise their tails and stimulate males by rubbing or crawling at their feet          The young male shows its fangs as its front legs stand either side of the female\u0027s rear a male lion will follow a lionness impatiently as she trails a strong odor behind her when she is in heat          A grin or perhaps a grimace as the lion prepares to mate with the lioness in the soft evening sunset light of the Maasai Mara the nature reserve is globally exceptional for its large lion, leopard and cheetah populations          The lion\u0027s face is scrunched in anticipation or frustration as it flexes above the lioness who growls back at him from the ground lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous, meaning they can go into heat several times throughout the year          The lion roars with its jaws wide and showing massive fangs as it stands astride the lioness who roars back at him photographer, Vclav Ilha, 55, said: \u0027I like my photos to capture some interaction.

Sky says its experts, including former expert witness forensic lip reader Tina Lannin, have concluded the mouth shape for \u0027wo\u0027 for woman is unmistakeable.Speaker John Bercow said he had consulted \u0027lip speakers\u0027 who believed the word was \u0027woman\u0027, but he added he himself accepted the Labour leader\u0027s denial.West Wing actor Rob Lowe, who is deaf in one ear, also waded into the row, tweeting he had seen Mr Cobryn \u0027say it with his own eyes\u0027.For the defence:Forensic lip-reader Jessica Rees told the Mirror: \u0027It’s very clear if you lipread him he’s saying “stupid people”.\u0027 Speaker Bercow, who has insisted he did not see the incident and has promised to review the footage, found himself in hot water when Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom pointed out he was accused of having said the same thing to her.          Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom raised a point of order to refer to an incident earlier this year where Mr Bercow was accused of calling her a \u0027stupid woman\u0027She raised a point of order to refer to an incident earlier this year where Mr Bercow was accused of calling her a \u0027stupid woman\u0027.She said: \u0027If iniduals who are found to have made unwelcome remarks should apologise, why it is that when an opposition member found that you had called me a \u0027stupid woman\u0027, you did not apologise in this chamber?\u0027 After repeated jeers and banging from Tory MPs, Mr Bercow said the matter had been \u0027treated of\u0027 previously.After My Corbyn returned to the House of Commons to insist he did not say \u0027stupid woman\u0027, but rather, \u0027stupid people\u0027, some on Twitter exploded in outrage including journalist Piers Morgan.He called the Labour leader\u0027s denials a \u0027flagrant lie\u0027 and said Mr Corbyn was \u0027digging himself an even deeper hole\u0027 by claiming he said \u0027stupid people\u0027.

Then, trembling, she called her mother and the police.Of course, by the time officers arrived the burglars had long gone. The policemen reassured the schoolgirl they would do everything they could to catch the intruders, who had broken in through the conservatory.Whether that actually happens, only time will tell. But her experience — brief as it was — has already had a profound impact. \u0027I just don\u0027t want to be by myself and can\u0027t sleep very well,\u0027 said Sophie. \u0027I have been having bad dreams and am scared they might come back.\u0027It\u0027s just the thought of what they might have done. It just keeps playing in mind . . . the way he looked into my eyes.\u0027Her mother Laura, meanwhile, who runs a car sales company, says: \u0027I can\u0027t even go into a shop and leave her in the car. At night she\u0027s been coming into my bed. I\u0027m not surprised — I would be the same. If the house had been empty and they\u0027d come in and stolen a couple of TVs it wouldn\u0027t have mattered. It\u0027s the fact that she was there when someone broke in that\u0027s so scary.\u0027What makes the break-in so astonishing is the sheer audacity of it. Not only did it happen in broad daylight, but there are four CCTV cameras (they weren\u0027t working at the time because the front of the house was being decorated, but the burglars didn\u0027t know that).Yet break-ins like these are becoming more common. The latest figures show that 58 per cent of burglaries occurred when the property was occupied — up from 53 per cent five years ago. At the same time, only one in ten crimes committed in England and Wales ends with anyone being charged.With budgets under pressure many forces no longer routinely investigate crimes such as burglaries, thefts and minor assaults. Which, it is claimed, sends out a message to criminals that they can go about their illicit business with little fear of being brought to book.Earlier this month pensioner Maureen Whale, 77, collapsed as she was on the phone reporting a gang of burglars who were ransacking her home in Barnet, North London, while she was inside. She died the following day.And on Sunday, an elderly wheelchair user died days after being assaulted during a burglary at his home. The 69-year-old man suffered injuries to his face and body following the break-in at his flat in Birmingham on December 10.In some ways Sophie and her mother are among the \u0027lucky\u0027 ones. Northumbria Police found a screwdriver left by the burglars. It has been sent away for DNA analysis while a number of neighbours have also come forward with descriptions, which detectives are probing.But the lasting psychological effect of such an incident cannot be underestimated. Consider the spine-chilling words of a woman whose home in Wolverhampton was broken into in the early hours last year.She was awoken by the sound of breaking glass and stayed hidden as the thief shone a torch into the downstairs room where she and her four-year-old son were asleep. Her daughter, ten, was asleep upstairs.\u0027Every second was fear, panic and shock — I have struggled with flashbacks of the night ever since,\u0027 said the 29-year-old in a witness impact statement delivered to a court last month, ahead of the intruder being sentenced to three years in jail.\u0027When he entered I hid under the covers with my son trying to call the police and praying that I could get help. I heard him go upstairs and into my daughter\u0027s room — this is something that still makes my blood run cold.\u0027My instincts were to chase him upstairs, but I couldn\u0027t as I didn\u0027t know at this stage if the police were on their way. I couldn\u0027t leave my son.\u0027And she added: \u0027Mentally we have been to hell and back.\u0027How do you tell a child they are safe to go to sleep when they know this might not be true?\u0027While in this instance the burglar was traced thanks to DNA left at the scene on a baseball cap, elsewhere victims of crime say police are all too often reluctant to carry out anything but the most superficial enquiries.It was reported last month that Britain\u0027s biggest police force is dismissing about a third of all reported crimes after only one telephone call with the victim.Burglaries, low-level assaults, criminal damage, theft and affray can all be dismissed without being investigated under a policy introduced by the Met Police last year.The danger of this approach, say experts, is that it both sends out the wrong message to criminals and leaves victims feeling abandoned.          Laura Thompson whose daughter Sophie, 14, disturbed two burglars who had broken into her home in Annitsford, NorthumberlandBarbara Oakley, operations manager at Victim Support, says: \u0027You want someone to come along and say: \u0027This is what you\u0027ll do next, this is what we will do next.\u0027\u0027You don\u0027t just want to make a phone call and then be left to tidy up the mess, and with all the fear. I think an officer turning up, taking you seriously, goes a long way with the public. Burglary is seen as one of the most personal crimes, because it is your information or your personal space that has been invaded.\u0027Indeed, according to a survey by alarm company Verisure 17 per cent of burglary victims are so badly affected by the experience they move home.Among them is chef Anthony Mercer, who was living with his sister near Rochdale when his house was broken into last summer. As the pair slept upstairs, a burglar or burglars broke in through a window.The following morning they woke up and came downstairs to discover the television, camera equipment, an Xbox and computer hard-drives worth thousands of pounds had been taken. Also missing was 36-year-old Mr Mercer\u0027s car, a Vauxhall Corsa, into which the gang had loaded up the stolen goods.The following day, police stopped the car, arresting the driver who was also found to be in possession of an imitation Samurai sword. Despite being caught red-handed, Mr Mercer was informed by police that the youth was subsequently dealt with by a youth rehabilitation order.\u0027If he had a weapon then you can only assume he had it when he broke into the house,\u0027 said Mr Mercer. \u0027It\u0027s terrifying. At the end of the day your home is your safe-haven. You presume that you are safe. Not feeling safe in your own house is an horrific thing.\u0027Now if there is any kind of noise, I\u0027m awake, bolt upright in bed, looking out the windows to see what\u0027s going on. You worry — is it happening again? I\u0027ve suffered from sleeplessness, fearfulness, general uneasiness.\u0027 Indeed, Mr Mercer has since moved to a \u0027quieter\u0027 area.As an emergency services worker Lucy Mackcracken knows the financial pressures the police are under. But when her house was burgled at the end of June as she slept upstairs with her husband James and five-year-old daughter Emilia, she expected the family would at least get a visit from police.Intruders had forced open the lock of a downstairs door at the detached property in Birmingham, entering the kitchen and taking the keys for her brand-new A Class Mercedes.The family slept through the raid, only discovering the car had gone the following morningHaving dialled 101 to report the crime, they received a visit from a forensics officer. They were then told that they would also have a visit from police who would investigate the crime. But no one came that day — or any other.\u0027In the end they said they were so busy they couldn\u0027t get to us,\u0027 said Mrs Mackcracken, who works in human resources for the ambulance service and was heavily pregnant at the time of the burglary.\u0027They told us they were going to knock on neighbours\u0027 doors but we didn\u0027t see them do that and none of our neighbours said they have done that. I was really disappointed and felt very vulnerable.\u0027For my daughter to have seen that something bad happened and the police haven\u0027t come to help us, it\u0027s left a bit of a mark in her mind.\u0027Police forces across the country have experienced big cuts in government funding that have led to a fall of more than 20,000 officers over the past eight years.And yet there are concerns that priorities have become distorted — with \u0027core policing\u0027 duties such as investigating burglaries and violent crimes being ignored in the drive to tackle hate crime. An offence becomes classified as a hate crime when the victim considers it to have been driven by hostility against their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity.Since 2013 the number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled to 94,000 last year. Recently, a raft of senior police officers have voiced their concerns. Sara Thornton, who chairs the National Police Chiefs Council, said forces lack the manpower to pursue or even record every issue raised. \u0027I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes,\u0027 she said.          Maureen Whale collapsed as burglars were ransacking her home in LondonShe was backed by Cressida Dick, commissioner of the MetPolice, who backed calls to return to \u0027traditional values\u0027 and priorities.Consider, by way of example, a couple of cases dealt with recently by Thames Valley Police.This is a force which closes investigations without identifying a suspect in seven out of ten household burglaries and reported vehicle thefts. And yet it recently emerged it had spent three years and thousands of pounds on a case involving a 70-year-old woman accused of beeping her horn at a black woman during a disagreement at a petrol station.Despite part-time charity worker Jane Savidge denying she had even known who was at the wheel of the vehicle, she was accused of racial abuse, something she vehemently denies. Yet Thames Valley Police have still recorded what had happened as a racially motivated \u0027hate crime\u0027.Outraged that her version of events has been ignored, and fearing the slur of being branded racist would affect her charitable work, she has been fighting the force for three years to get them to change their records — to no avail.The force\u0027s diligence in that matter does not play well with 57-year-old David Holley, who lives near Bicester in Oxfordshire. In January his £12,000 caravan was stolen from in front of his house in the early hours. Although the criminals didn\u0027t enter his property, knowing they were just outside his front door still frightens David.\u0027I called the police immediately, and told them the thieves had left behind broken locks that could be of interest forensically and that there was CCTV footage of the them coming and going in a car.\u0027But it was almost a week before the first officer visited the scene, and almost three weeks before they checked CCTV and carried out house-to-house enquiries. He says he was told that the delay did not matter because \u0027the number plates would almost certainly be false\u0027.NASA engineer comes up with epic revenge package to catch...A Bronx tale of redemption? \u0027Hollywood loves a good...Share this articleUnsurprisingly, no arrests were made, prompting Mr Holley to complain about the force\u0027s \u0027unwillingness to investigate\u0027.Mr Holley, who works for a private bank, says: \u0027There was no attempt to do anything to recover the property I\u0027d had stolen. I feel very, very badly let down.\u0027 But Thames Valley Police rejected his complaint, and a subsequent appeal.\u0027This does not come down to an unwillingness to investigate, it comes down to the number of resources we as a service have to deploy,\u0027 an officer wrote to Mr Holley. \u0027We can\u0027t investigate every theft and difficult choices have to be made.\u0027Talking of the two cases, a spokesman added: \u0027The way hate incidents are investigated, and the way burglaries are investigated, are clearly very different, but as with all offences, Thames Valley Police has a duty to investigate. The investigation of hate-related crimes and incidents does not have any impact on the investigation of burglaries or any other crimes.\u0027Whether such assurances will deter those intent on spoiling someone else\u0027s Christmas by burgling homes and stealing possessions — whether they\u0027re in the property or not — is another matter."},{"url":null,"title":"Bare faced deceit Corbynista tipped female black PM","story":"Labour whip Fiona Onasanya, 35, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice at the Old Bailey todayAs a Labour whip, Fiona Onasanya was responsible for ensuring the discipline and loyalty of her fellow MPs.So how ironic that what ultimately sealed her fate was a fatal blow delivered by of one of her closest political allies.It was only after her first trial had begun that prosecutors were handed the key piece of evidence that finally nailed the 35-year-old\u0027s lies.Reading details in his local paper, Dr Christian DeFeo, her former aide, realised the speeding offence which put her in the Old Bailey dock had taken place close to his home on a night when she had driven to visit him.Onasanya had denied being behind the wheel of the Nissan Micra when it was clocked at 41mph in a 30mph zone. Instead it was claimed that a Russian man was driving.But in his bombshell evidence Dr DeFeo described how the MP had in fact arrived, alone, in the car, and had spent at least two hours at the property, leaving so late his wife had offered her a bed for the night.He also told the court he had never seen anyone but Onasanya behind the wheel of her Micra and that two mobile phones which police said were in the car at the time of the offence belonged to her and were never out of her sight.While Onasanya would take the stand and try to claim that her former speech writer had got it wrong, no one was in any doubt as to the significance of his intervention – Dr DeFeo included.\u0027It is with the greatest reluctance I have to do this,\u0027 he told the Old Bailey. \u0027But to do otherwise, I cannot. It is legally and morally unacceptable not to.\u0027And therein lies a second irony. Because when it comes to morals, Onasanya has made a great play of hers ever since her election.     Ms Onasanya was accused by prosecutors of telling the court \u0027a dishonest construction put together from top to bottom with lies\u0027          Her conviction was secured after testimony from former aide Christian DeFeo, pictured here with Onasanya          When questioned by police over the speed of her Nissan Micra in this speed camera photograph - and over her confused and confusing written answers to their questions - Onasanya remained completely silentIn interview after interview the qualified solicitor told how her Christian upbringing had moulded her into the person she was, encouraging her to go into law because she wanted to \u0027help people\u0027.\u0027I am motivated in all that I do by my abiding faith in God,\u0027 she said in her maiden speech to Parliament. She ended her address with the words: \u0027I intend to do right.\u0027Thus far that has largely meant showing unswerving loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, whom she gushingly praised as a \u0027visionary\u0027 and the architect of a \u0027new and better way\u0027.Yet what ultimately brought Onasanya down was the old sin behind the demise of so many politicians through the ages – hubris, the arrogance and pride that so often precedes a fall.Accused of a minor motoring offence she decided that, rather than face the rap, she would wriggle out of it, enlisting her brother\u0027s help.\u0027This case may have started as a case about an offence of speeding,\u0027 said David Jeremy QC, prosecuting. \u0027It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying ... lying to avoid prosecution for a breach of the laws that apply, or should apply, to every single one of us whoever you may be. What a shame she did not tell the truth in the beginning.\u0027While not the first politician caught out by lies – the former Lib Dem minister Chris Huhne was jailed in remarkably similar circumstances – what is extraordinary about Onasanya\u0027s case is the trajectory of her rise and fall.          \u0027I am motivated in all that I do by my abiding faith in God,\u0027 the newly-elected MP said in her maiden speech to ParliamentThis was a woman who, until she was elected as MP for Peterborough in June last year, was unheard of in national politics.And yet within months she had been chosen as a Labour whip and was tipping herself to become the UK\u0027s first black woman prime minister.So what is known of her?Her mother Paulina was born in London but met her father, Frank, in Nigeria before they settled in Cambridge, where he played semi-professional football.Onasanya and her younger brother Festus – they are just 16 months apart – were born and grew up in the city, although her parents\u0027 marriage broke up when she was three.When she was injured as a child following a collision with a speeding car, her deeply religious mother took her home and prayed. The MP went to the Netherhall co-ed state school, leaving with 11 GCSEs and four A-levels, \u0027mostly Bs\u0027. After that she decided to study law at the University of Hertfordshire, qualifying as a solicitor in 2015.          Within months of her election win, loyal Corbynite Onasanya had been chosen as a Labour whip and was tipping herself to become the UK\u0027s first black woman prime ministerShe chose commercial property law as it was the least \u0027contentious\u0027, saying other areas, such as the criminal law, didn\u0027t always have a \u0027happy ending\u0027.\u0027I wouldn\u0027t want to send someone innocent to prison, or vice versa try and negotiate terms for someone that maybe should go to prison,\u0027 she observed.Given her current predicament, those are skills that might have come in handy.She claims she entered politics by accident. In 2011 she was with a friend in a pub talking about the London riots when the secretary for the Cambridge Labour Party overheard her and asked her to join them.She did so and in 2013 was elected as a Labour county councillor, before rising to deputy leader of the Labour group on the council. In 2017 she was selected as Labour\u0027s parliamentary candidate for Peterborough.It was a tough seat. The Tory incumbent, Stewart Jackson, had been in situ for 12 years and UKIP did not stand because it wanted to give Eurosceptic Mr Jackson a better chance of winning.Indeed it was only following a recount that at 3am on the morning of June 9 that Onasanya was announced the victor with a majority of just 607 votes. Quite an achievement.And yet, within weeks, the seeds of her downfall would be sown.On July 24, 2017, at 10.03pm a speed camera on the B1167 at Thorney flashed into action, capturing the MP\u0027s speeding car.As automatically happens in such cases, a week later a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) form was sent to Onasanya. It was duly returned naming a Russian man called Aleks Antipow as being behind the wheel. Mr Antipow had previously lived in Chesterton, Cambridge, at a house rented by Onasanya and her brother, the court heard.          In July, Fiona Onasanya and her brother Festus, 33, pictured above, were charged with perverting the course of justice. He pleaded guilty. At her trial she tried to place all the blame for the matter on him, telling the Old Bailey he had \u0027set her up\u0027Initial enquiries by police found that the form contained incorrect details for Mr Antipow. Another letter asking for them to be checked was sent to the MP on September 14.Onasanya replied a week later: \u0027I am not sure how I can be of further assistance. I have supplied the details made known to me as well as the licence information. It is a criminal offence to say I was the driver when I was not.\u0027She would subsequently be forced to admit she had not in fact filled in the original NIP form. Her explanation was as follows. Onasanya claimed that she had left the form for her mother to deal with, believing that because the offence was committed on a Monday she would have been staying in London to attend to her normal Parliamentary duties.The car would have been left in Cambridge, so that her mother, brother or others could drive it.But, she claimed, her assumption about the timing of the speeding offence was wrong: Parliament had in fact gone into summer recess the previous week. That meant she had not been in London on the day in question. An honest mistake of a busy woman, she said. She only realised she had got the wrong date when she was charged by police – a full year after the incident. She had checked her diary and realised her mistake.Onasanya told the court that when she had sought further details about the case back in September 2017, she had been assured by her brother that \u0027it was sorted out\u0027. Apparently satisfied with that explanation, she asked no further questions.She went on to explain this staggering lack of curiosity by claiming that at the time she was very busy in her new job. And she claimed she was \u0027not in a good place\u0027, due to health issues relating to an earlier diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.When the police\u0027s attempts to find Mr Antipow hit a brick wall they once again asked the MP for clarification by email and letter.  Onasanya left the Old Bailey today aware she might face a prison sentence. In 2013 Liberal Democrat MP Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Price were both jailed for eight months for a very similar offenceShe claimed that Mr Antipow had filled in the NIP form himself. Inquiries would establish that at the time of the offence he had actually been more than 1,000 miles away at home in Russia.Officers once again set in motion attempts to contact the MP and were eventually able to schedule a voluntary interview for January 2 this year. During dozens of questions at Bedfordshire Police Headquarters, Onasanya remained completely silent.In her defence it was claimed that she had a cold on the day, and she felt \u0027overwhelmed\u0027. In July, Onasanya and her brother were charged with perverting the course of justice. He pleaded guilty.She later claimed in the dock that Festus had \u0027set her up\u0027, that she was unaware of his criminal behaviour and was shocked when she learned what he had done.\u0027I haven\u0027t spoken to him about why he has done this but I need to,\u0027 she told the original trial.It was the prosecution case Festus and his sister had acted together, co-ordinating their lies. Onasanya denied this was the case, blaming her brother alone.But in the end her attempt to save her skin by sacrificing her sibling was undone, in large part, by the last-minute intervention of Dr DeFeo.\u0027The evidence of the DeFeos exposes Ms Onasanya\u0027s story as a dishonest construction put together from top to bottom with lies,\u0027 said the prosecutor.With her career – both political and legal – now in ruins, the maniacally busy life of an MP is probably not something she will have to worry about in the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8f36d275d75d7abb434e375a2c6fafbd5d6a42/0_432_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a449194649e8f682eb842b53c08f3bc0","title":"banksy port talbot mural south wales","story":"Street artist strikes again with artwork of child under ash shower in Welsh steel townBanksy has confirmed he is behind a striking bittersweet artwork that has appeared on a garage in the south Wales steel town of Port Talbot.From one angle, the piece shows a child in a bobble hat with a sled, apparently enjoying a snow shower and trying to catch the flakes on their tongue. But from another, it becomes clear that what is actually falling on the child is ash billowing from a bin, or perhaps a chimney.Banksy appeared to confirm the work was his on Wednesday by uploading an image of it on to his website. A video was also posted on the artist’s Instagram account showing the mural accompanied by the children’s Christmas song Little Snowflake. The camera rises above the garage and shows Port Talbot’s rooftops and industrial works wreathed in smoke.Ian Lewis, 55, a steelworker, was surprised to discover Banksy had been at work on his garage wall. “I’m a bit overwhelmed at the moment, to be honest. Fans of Banksy have come along to see it,” he said.The Aberavon councillor, Nigel Thomas Hunt, said: “We’re buzzing down here. The placing of the work is very clever. You can look at the painting and see the furnaces in the background. We’re delighted.

He has also translated multiple early English works including Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and worked on several history documentaries for the BBC. Awarded a CBE in 2010 for his services to poetry, Armitage is currently professor of poetry at Oxford University and Leeds University, and previously at Sheffield.The award, which was created by King George V in 1933 at the suggestion of the then poet laureate, John Masefield, is decided by a committee headed by the laureate – currently Carol Ann Duffy, in her final year in the role. Summing up the committee’s decision, Duffy praised Armitage as “boundary-breaking”, spinning “poems of emotional weight and musical grace from the fabric of our everyday lives”.His poems, wrote Duffy, “would challenge hypocrisy wherever they encountered it, giving voice to those rarely admitted into poetry, and extending an arm around the unheard and the dispossessed. And for all the attention to the grain and trouble of daily lives, the poems never lost sight of wider horizons: our outer space full of possibilities, the dream space of our love.”Armitage told the  he was “absolutely delighted” by the award. “When you write poems you’re not always sure they are hitting the mark. So this is incredibly flattering,” he said.The 55-year-old poet said his parents, particularly his father, had been emotional at the news of his medal, which he will receive at a ceremony with the queen in 2019. “The only shame is that it didn’t come before Christmas,” he said, “or I’d have put the medal on top of the tree.”Armitage said he felt the face of poetry was changing in Britain, particularly the role of poet laureate the 400-year-old title has, in modern times, transformed into a public engagement role and is once again up for grabs, with Duffy’s tenure ending in 2019 after a decade in the role. “In decades and centuries gone by, the laureate role was a more remote and aloof position, but the world has changed and poetry has changed with it,” Armitage said. “In comparison with other countries, in Britain there is a common reader for poetry. There are opportunities to write poetry about topical events and people still have a place for poetry in their hearts and minds.”Previous recipients of the queen’s medal include Philip Larkin, Siegfried Sassoon, Imtiaz Dharker and WH Auden, a prestigious cohort Armitage said he felt honoured to join: “I think if that strangeness ever goes away, you’re finished as a writer. If you stop being bewildered by whatever recognition comes your way. Seeing your name on that list, it is humbling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a612864dee4600035403369f621c90d53c50ee8/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2466ede21ff7a6384204980e0fbe8974","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:“All human wisdom is contained in these two words: ‘wait’ and ‘hope’”Cheery news from jimitron5000, who is reading Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk:There are deaths (probably murder), heavy snow, melted snow, William Blake, a car with a name, a lot of moustachioed men, an outdoor dentist that uses booze as an anaesthetic and a main character is delightfully eccentric - calling people by qualities she sees in them rather than their name for example, and a whole lot more. All in all, thoroughly enjoyable thus far.Also looking on the bright side of life is Thomas75164 who is reading Thomas Hardy’s Far From The Madding Crowd:I am enjoying the visit to Hardy country again. Such a wonderfully evocative writer with the constant threat of doom lurking.American Tabloid by James Ellroy has given Tom Mooney a good going over:No one but Ellroy could pull this off. This is a takedown of the Kennedys. Of Jack and Bobby, and Joe too. An expose of the lurid collusion between the mob, the CIA, the FBI, the teamsters and the government. It’s 10 books of plot rammed into 600 frantic, bloody, filthy pages.It’s genius. But now I’m worn out and tired. I feel like I got a shakedown from Pete Bondurant. Until next time, Mr Ellroy.Reading A People’s Tragedy: The Russian Revolution from 1891-1924 by Orlando Figes has been an “effort” for greenmill, but “worth it”:I now feel that I have a reasonable purchase both on the events and the historical context in which they occurred. The book, although not a recent publication, also goes some way to explaining how Russia got to be the way it is in 2018. Highly recommended.The Soviet state has also been occupying rgilyead, who has just finished Serhii Plotsky’s Chernobyl:A serious historian’s view of what lead up to, and what followed from, the nuclear power station catastrophe. What is clear is that the instinctive secrecy of the Soviet state not only contributed to the causes of the disaster but also alienated the people of Ukraine and Belarus who were worst affected. This had a direct bearing on the rise of nationalistic political movements and the break up of the Soviet Union. The book may have a serious subject but the writing style is easy to read and rather compelling.“Another rather splendid work”, The Great American Novel by Philip Roth, has impressed julian6:An exuberant ode to baseball - a pastime with mythic status in the States. As a dabbler in softball - baseball’s gentler handmaiden - I do have quite a close rapport with this. With a joking nod to Moby Dick, Roth presents a gallery of absurd narratives about an impossibly strange and inept baseball team - the Ruppert Mundys. A wild satire and a wild ride, Roth’s liberating transgressive brio is a stunning tonic for our pinch-faced times.Finally, ChronicExpat has a good tip for reading beside the fire this Christmas:A couple of days ago I read Dickens’s The Story of the Goblins Who Stole a Sexton. This is actually an excerpt from The Pickwick Papers but is included as a free-standing short story (13 pages) in the Penguin Classics edition of A Christmas Carol and Other Christmas Writings. It struck me that this might be a brilliant thing for reading aloud – lots of opportunities for funny and scary voices, etc. I have no children, nieces, nephews or grandchildren upon which to test this hypothesis but if you do, it might be one to keep in mind for Christmas ghost story reading.Please report back if you do test it!If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Perhaps it is the inherent value of books and, more widely, knowledge, or the sense that reading can better us. Philip Pullman once described independent bookshops as “the lantern bearers of civilisation” perhaps it is that bookshops, like libraries, feel like sanctuaries. (Except perhaps on Christmas Eve.) Or, the niggling sense that all those Mr Men and Enid Blytons somehow shaped us into who we are today, and the possibility that picking up any book on the next three-for-two table might even shape who we are tomorrow.With the British high street in trouble, and retailers preparing for the slowest Christmas sales in a decade, bookshops are, rather surprisingly, a beacon of hope. Nielsen BookScan reported year-on-year growth of £22m, with this year looking like it will best even 2016, when book sales reached £1.59bn, and Britain’s biggest book chain Waterstones made its first profit since the 2008 financial crisis. (A boom attributed to, at least partly, the return of the boy wizard as the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child hit shelves, and the first cookbook by that popular bundle of health, Joe Wicks).Booksellers in the UK and the US have anecdotally reported an upturn in sales and footfall this year. There are a number of possible explanations. Books are classed as “low ticket” items (cheap), so they tend to fare better during hard times. We’ve also had a series of big releases: Michelle Obama’s Becoming, a new David Walliams, yet another JK Rowling. But also, I feel like a wider, general appreciation is taking shape, a sense that bookshops are providing something beyond transactions – exemplified in something that happened in one tiny bookshop in Richmond, Virginia.At the weekend, Fountain Bookstore owner Kelly Justice watched “dozens” of her customers “showrooming”: using the shop to research purchases to be made online later. “I approached three people just a few minutes apart and asked them politely if they enjoyed finding the books here, if they would please buy them here. All three of them bought my recommendations right in front of my eyes on their phones and one of them actually laughed in my face,” she wrote in an email to me. “Earlier in the week, a woman came in with a group of co-workers and was zipping around the store searching things from our inventory on her phone and shouting ‘Amazon wins again!’ every time she found a lower price. I was speechless. At a certain point, you just get upset, you know?”Five years ago, when I was a bookseller, showrooming was a problem customers would often often disguise their motives as concern, starting up conversations about the fate of our jobs in the wake of Amazon (before leaving in a huff when a twentysomething refused to give them a discount). However, though Kelly says the practice has increased in her store, her angry tweet provoked 47,000 likes and hundreds of message from readers and booksellers around the world, sympathetic and appalled that anyone would be so rude.“The world shouted back, ‘Neighbourhoods matter, little bookshops matter, you matter.’ It’s been overwhelming,” she wrote to me. “I’ve cried a lot. And I can tell you tears of gratitude beat tears of anger all day long.”Perhaps the continued survival of bookshops relies on reframing booksellers as “agents of culture rather than just instruments of commerce”, as author Tim Winton once said. The best booksellers are not, strangely, just there to sell books: their knowledge allows them to arrange the books you see on shelves in a concerted way, not just to pack the shelves on the offchance they’ll make a profit. (A far more laudable skill than stocking rubbish books by everyone and their grandmother in a warehouse in Rugeley.) While this infuriates modern shoppers, many of whom treat the tiniest independents as failures for not functioning like a online behemoth, there is something tangible and valuable about being able to ask another human being to share their knowhow. I’ve had customers cry in front of me about books they loved bring me in books just for the joy of sharing and even cheerfully refused my assistance because they were waiting for a colleague who always chose perfectly for them.It is my hope – and the hope of booksellers like Kelly – that this appreciation for bookshops solidifies and helps them thrive in what is likely to be a tumultuous 2019. For all the warm fuzzies, Amazon’s market share continues to grow, and it keeps slashing book prices in the hope that consumers will prize price over anything. But last year, the number of independent bookshops in the UK grew by one, to 868: yes, minuscule growth, but the first increase in two decades in which more than 1,000 indies disappeared. That crash that began in 1995 – the same year Amazon started. Hopefully, no one needs the reminder, but: a bookshop is for life, not just for Christmas.• Sian Cain is the ’s books site editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b42c64e72192887f0675318d98eaad032a9ff0/0_3_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=9ed718c54da621d08be6aa39f7327873","title":"trevor noah stephen colbert russian election meddling michael flynn","story":"Late-night hosts examine Russian suppression of African American voters and the downfall of Michael FlynnLate-night hosts react to Russia’s suppression of African American voter turnout and Michael Flynn’s rebuke by a federal judge.“Twenty-eighteen is almost over, but it feels like the whole country is still nursing a hangover from the 2016 election,” host Trevor Noah said at the top of the Daily Show. Part of that hangover? A report to the US Senate’s intelligence committee on how Russian social media accounts suppressed African American voter turnout in 2016.The report details “how deep the Russian rabbit hole goes”, said Noah, such as encouraging African American voters to either stay home or vote for the Green party candidate, Jill Stein, by spreading Michael Jackson memes and slogans.The news isn’t great, but at least it showed that “some white people actually do think that black lives matter”, said Daily Show correspondent Dulcé Sloan.“At least they’re paying attention to us,” she told Noah. “The only time our president notices us is when he’s fighting with LeBron James on Twitter. Trump probably thinks that Martin Luther King’s last name is Boulevard.”“Doesn’t it bother you that Russia only did this to suppress the black vote?” Noah asked.“Trevor, you know who else suppresses America’s black vote? America,” Sloan countered. “Have you been to Georgia?”“I’m not saying I’m fine with it,” she said of the meddling, “I’m just saying that I appreciate the effort” of getting to know Black America.“Do you know how hard it must be for a Russian to understand the Migos? You have to learn English and then forget it,” she joked.“I mean, that’s the kind of work I want our government to put in.”On the Late Show, Colbert discussed the sentencing hearing for Trump’s former national security adviser and “dad from a Twisted Sister video” Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.In a sentencing memo last week, Flynn’s lawyers argued that it wasn’t his fault because “agents hadn’t warned Flynn that it was a crime to lie to the FBI”.“Of course, good point!” Colbert interjected. “How is he supposed to know? They gotta tell him! Just like how hospitals all have to post signs that say, ‘Do not steal cough medicine and then burn down this building.’”Though the president offered support on Twitter for his adviser, who once led a “Lock her up” chant against Hillary Clinton at the Republican national convention, Flynn was rebuked on Tuesday by Judge Emmet Sullivan for betraying his country.The judge ultimately declared a recess to let Flynn consider whether he would rather proceed to sentencing or delay and cooperate with Mueller’s investigation in the hopes of leniency.“That’s a tough call – that’s like choosing between apples and decades in prison,” remarked Colbert.“I’ll take that apple, please,” he said of Flynn’s assessment of that choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88e6b6cf50455ca72d76aa7f9503607186ab64cb/0_220_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d1c14481f48095f82a0258ea6e2769f","title":"homesickness at university is there a cure","story":"It’s among the most common experiences for students. Coping is a matter of settling in and keeping busyJames Mahoney, 19, who has just started university in Glasgow, says his homesickness was triggered by a bad date. He didn’t get on with the person, who he’d met online, and he was suddenly reminded of the people closest to him back home. He returned to his flat and his mind began to race with thoughts of his native Northern Ireland. “I was trying to sleep but kept thinking about my best friend and my family,” he says. “For some reason I also started to think about past Christmas get togethers.”Mahoney (not his real name) knew homesickness would strike at some point. “In Northern Ireland my neighbours are literally cows, so it’s intimidating being here. It’s overwhelming.”Homesickness is common among students: research from the Student Housing Company found that as many as three quarters suffer from it. It can strike during freshers’ week, a Christmas spent in student halls, or on returning from holidays. Students may feel sad, anxious, emotional and tearful, says Lawrence Pearman, from the student services department at the University of Southampton.Homesickness can be described as a “minigrief”, according to a 2015 review of scientific literature. We tend to take the feeling lightly, but it hasn’t always been that way. In the 17th century it was known as “nostalgia”, which combines the Greek words for “homecoming” and “pain”, and was considered a noble and serious condition. It even reportedly killed 74 soldiers in the American Civil war.But feelings of homesickness don’t have to be dramatic – and aren’t always directly related to home. According to Harriet Harris, who works at the chaplaincy centre at the University of Edinburgh, you may simply feel “emotionally wobbly” and not know why.Pressure for first-year students to meet new people can exacerbate the feelings of isolation. “You watch everybody come together into new groups of friends and might feel you don’t fit in,” says Katie Pruszynski, who works in research support at the University of Sheffield.For Lucy Cooksley, 18, who has just started her first year at Falmouth University, homesickness normally hits her when she wakes up. “It was hard feeling this way and having to go out during freshers’ week to make friends,” she says.Such feelings can reflect other, more serious psychological difficulties, says Barbara Jennings, a senior lecturer at Norwich Medical School. Mahoney says feelings of homesickness are exacerbated because he also suffers from anxiety.International students in particular may also struggle. Stella Matsouka, 20, who is from Greece and is studying at the University of Essex, says homesickness makes her feel claustrophobic. She also misses Greek culture. “I was surprised by how polite people are here,” she says. “Sometimes I wish I could just swear at someone at the traffic lights.”Rachel Leticia Cahyono, 18, from Indonesia and studying at Swinburne University in Melbourne, says her homesickness didn’t strike until she had been in Australia for a few months. She started to miss family and home-cooked food such as fried rice and clear chicken soup. “I can’t quite make it the way I want,” she says.But if you’re feeling homesick, there are solutions. Pearman says one of the first things to do is to talk to people. “It could be student support, friends, or family,” he suggests. “Anywhere you can exchange stories and coping strategies.”“We miss people and that’s completely normal,” Cate Campbell, a BACP registered psychologist, says. “For example people often talk about the lack of noise in a new house.” Campbell says reminiscing about home will “probably release some feel-good endorphins”. You should also re-frame the experience. “You have to think of life as happening in chunks,” she says. “You’ve had one chunk. That’s a great chunk. Now you’re experiencing a new one.”It’s easy to imagine you’re the only person struggling. Cooksley says that when she plucked up the courage to tell her housemates about her homesickness, she realised they all felt the same.Pearman also recommends you make your room your own by bringing “photos from home, a particular poster, favourite pillows or a bed set”, and get involved by going to meet-ups and events. “Look after yourself and do things you enjoy like reading, exercise, eat regular meals and sleep well,” he says. It may also be good to put off going home for a short time while you settle in, Pearman adds.When Matsouka gets homesick she reminds herself why she’s away from home in the first place. “I was really excited to come to the UK and it’s where I can prosper,” she says.Aim to reach a point where you feel you can “internalise” home, Harris says. “If you can do that then you start to feel at home in yourself and there’s a sense in which you can go anywhere.” And it’s important not to be too hard on yourself about feeling homesick. “Don’t speak harshly to yourself about the fact you’re feeling this. The whole process of moving away from home to somewhere completely new, with all the uncertainty that comes along with that, is a sign of your resourcefulness.”Mahoney said his feelings were a reminder of how much he has to return to. “It made me think that I have a home and people that I can’t wait to see,” he says. He’s getting to know his new housemates, and finds that “just having company around me is really helpful”. But he won’t go on any more dates until he’s settled in, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2c7c7b69639bfcad0066974f4e94d65e1168c8/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4fba1e5b6a4b9128d5e2ba55bbc1392","title":"the cult of smellness whats behind the extraordinary rise in sales of scented candles","story":"Given that the world is falling apart, it seems odd to be talking about scented candles. Or maybe it doesn’t. As we hurtle towards Christmas, with deeper austerity and a possible no-deal Brexit on the horizon, a nice smell might be exactly what we need.Wellness and its younger sister, self-care, are crowded fields, but growing ones. According to the latest research by the Global Wellness Institute (GWI), the worldwide wellness market was worth a colossal $4.2tn (£3.3tn) in 2017, and scented candles are without doubt an extension of it. Lest we forget, consumerism is about improving things we didn’t know needed improving – such as the smell of your home.And then, of course, there’s social media. This is the age of the bathroom selfie. The influencers who had artfully arranged flowers or a coffee table book in the background, now slot in a flickering candle.Scented candles have a bad rap, not least because it is literally burning money. We associate them with poshness, frivolity and celebrities and anyone fluent in smellness knows it all started with Diptyque. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Victoria Beckham both burn Diptyque’s Figuier, while Beyoncé prefers Vanille. Even Theresa May likes them – blink and you would miss the Diptyque candle on the table of her now-notorious leather trouser shoot of 2016.Gallingly, especially in the case of May, a Diptyque candle will set you back about £50 – that’s £1 an hour, if the alleged burn time of 50-60 hours holds up. That the large luxury fashion houses are now making them makes sense the “affordable” stuff – lighters, socks and the like – tend to offer the greatest return, provide a way to court entry-level shoppers and show a commitment to self-care. Gucci’s candles cost more than £200, and the incense sticks £55.But the candle industry of 2018 has mushroomed, and democratised. Now there are hundreds of candles, many affordable. Matthew Herman and David Kien of Boy Smells, who sell underwear and scented candles for about £20, say the idea of luxury has changed. “It’s not just about price point, it’s about how it makes you feel, and the value it adds to your life.” Zara Home, H\u0026ampM and The White Company all sell candles for under £20.So what gives? Our collective desire to burn stuff could be a hangover of hygge. This Danish concept might have tipped into parody and even danger – recent research shows that overusing candles can lead to exposure to possibly dangerous levels of fumes and an increase in house fires – but its economy burns ever brighter. The average Dane still goes through about 6kg of candle wax a year. What’s more, staying in is the new going out out, with sleepleisure – clothing focused squarely on comfort – replacing athleisure (although they are much of a muchness). Sheet-mask selfies taken in your bathroom are one of the great, weird Instagram trends of 2018, while Vogue has an entire web series showing celebrities getting ready in their loo, not their bedroom. It makes sense that the “peer in” culture would extend to a votive – and that you would want your home to smell as good as you do given that, well, you are not leaving it.Herman and Kien agree: “People started identifying with self-care, wanting the brands they buy for their bathroom and home to be reflections of how they see themselves and their style.” While a lot of the wellness market – looking at you, yoni eggs – is pure quackery, you can’t deny the empirical power of something that smells. “I’ve turned my indoors into my outdoors,” says one friend who has been burning nature-scented candles for a decade. It is not simply that we want to look better. We want to smell better too.Sophie Beresiner, the beauty director of Elle, launched her own line, No 22, in her kitchen. The most popular scent is called Laundry Room, which smells of exactly that, although Bookshelf is a close contender and has a pleasant logic to it (leather for the spine, vanilla for the sweetness of old pages, musk for the dustiness).Bella Freud’s £45 Art candle is designed to evoke an artist’s studio (palmarosa, cedar and guiac wood are reminiscent of oil paint, old wood and paint brushes, she says). Frédéric Malle, the esteemed French nose, goes one esoteric step further to capture a time, a place and a country – “the end of a Parisian dinner when the guests have just left” – with something called Cafe Society. No dinner I’ve ever been to, mind you, but the sentiment’s there.Dig deeper, of course, and there is probably some of that at play here. The power of smell is indisputable. Even if you are not Proust, with your memory triggered by a madeleine soaked in tea, you can appreciate the phenomenon. As a child in 1900, the philosopher Walter Benjamin needed the smell of cooked apple emanating from a bedside oven to help him sleep. For Naomi Campbell, it was 25 lily-scented candles that did the trick. “Smell is the most intimate of senses, and it is as inidual as our own fingerprint, because it is totally dependent on our life experiences,” says Dove – which would figure if one of my favourites was the smell of warm sheep dung through an open window (I grew up surrounded by it).The dominant scents on the market – or at least the newer, trendier ones – really are smells, rather than scents. “If it’s something you already related to, you’ll find it comforting immediately,” says Beresiner. Anya Hindmarch’s candle range is a case in point: hers smell of chewing gum, pencil shavings, washing powder, tobacco and even baby powder.While researching this, I came across a blog suggesting women’s interest in scented candles is rooted in “equality”. “The candle scents recreate the homes they once loved, but have chosen, by their careers and lifestyles, not to create themselves,” it said. Sexism aside, there may be something in it. I live in a block of flats and my flat tends to smell of the dominant ingredient of another person’s cooking. Were I to cook more during the week, I may not need to mask the smells of those who do. I don’t have money to burn, but I will probably still burn something at the weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae32fd6e5408f035996c424ec5295d978b6b0431/0_284_3297_1978/master/3297.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05be1ab3299dd3cccd4de37bc0d05f0d","title":"penny marshall comedy connoisseur laverne shirley big awakenings","story":"From Laverne \u0026amp Shirley to Big, Awakenings and A League of Their Own, the sitcom star turned film director poured her warmth and innate genius for humour into a string of popular screen hitsPenny Marshall, who has died aged 75, was a television star of the 70s who parlayed her talent, her contacts and her innate genius for humour and warmth into a brilliant movie directing career, giving us glorious films such as Big and A League of Their Own.A succession of bland West Coast executives discovered that the Bronx accent she had on TV was no acting fake. “Did you know she gave me two of the best jobs I ever had?” Tom Hanks once asked. “Of course not, because when she talks she’s barely comprehensible.” Among her many achievements, Marshall pretty much invented Tom Hanks, giving him his breakout lead role in her wonderful fantasy comedy Big in 1988 (scripted by Anne Spielberg and Gary Ross), about a little kid who suddenly becomes a man. Marshall staged a classic moment of comic brio and childhood wish-fulfilment: the dancing on the giant toy piano keys in a Fifth Avenue toy shop. In that one moment, Penny Marshall distilled a joyous kind of life lesson: creativity and performing should be fun the kind of unselfconscious, innocent fun you had as a kid.Marshall was the real thing: smart, funny, opinionated, a professional comedy connoisseur and someone who certainly represented a challenge to the industry’s dullard menfolk, who thought women were there to be pretty and nothing else. She was one half of the TV sitcom duo Laverne and Shirley, in a show produced by her brother Garry about two roommates getting into scrapes in a fondly imagined late-50s America. Running from 1976 to 1983, Laverne \u0026amp Shirley became the most-watched show in the US. Tellingly, it had been spun off from the similarly popular Happy Days, whose star Ron Howard enjoyed a career trajectory similar to Marshall’s. Laverne and Shirley were first introduced on a double-date: the less conventionally attractive Laverne (played by Marshall) was paired with Henry Winkler’s tough Fonzie, while the more demure-looking Shirley (Cindy Williams) went with Ron Howard’s clean-cut Richie Cunningham. An awestruck Winkler said that, together, Marshall and Williams were the “modern Lucille Ball”.From 1971 to 1981, before her film directing career took off, Marshall was married to Rob Reiner, who legally adopted her daughter Tracy from a previous marriage. Reiner was another man who owed a great deal to her professionally: she was hugely influential on his career. Together, they were a power couple of Hollywood comedy, and their home became a salon for writers and performers such as Albert Brooks, Billy Crystal and James L Brooks. Their parties were legendary and Marshall never saw any reason to deny having enjoyed drink and drugs in those days. She and Reiner remained good friends.Marshall was ambitious and quick-witted and saw how she could develop, not as a character player but as a director – first taking charge of episodes of Laverne \u0026amp Shirley, and then graduating to the movies. Her friend Whoopi Goldberg was instrumental in getting her the wacky comedy Jumpin’ Jack Flash, in which Goldberg’s bank teller somehow gets involved in an espionage conspiracy.Big was a glorious triumph for Marshall: a high-concept fantasy comedy in the “body-swap” style. Marshall gave it exactly the right touch and got from Hanks the right sweet-natured innocence, decency and sense of adventure. It was a Capraesque career-launch for Marshall, whose next feature, Awakenings (1990), had points in common. It, too, was about a short-lived, revelatory quasi-fantasy moment from which lessons could be learned. Adapted by Steven Zaillian from the Oliver Sacks memoir, the movie was about Sacks’s experimental use of the drug L-Dopa to revive patients with encephalitis lethargica, or “sleeping sickness”. Robin Williams played the Sacks figure and Robert De Niro is Leonard, a catatonic patient who miraculously “awakens”. Marshall had been put in charge of two of the biggest male personalities in American cinema, Williams and De Niro, but found a way of keeping them under control. Sacks was said to be stunned at the way Williams had been turned by Marshall into his imaginary younger brother.Next was a movie considered a gem of popular American cinema: A League of Their Own (1992), based on a true story from the 1940s about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, starring Geena Davis, Rosie O’Donnell and Madonna, with Tom Hanks as the grumpy has-been given the job of coach. With so many men away fighting in the second world war, women’s baseball is being promoted as an alternative to the men’s game, analogous to the way women were being allowed to do other men’s civvy-street jobs in wartime. There was a lovely humour, drama and storytelling punch in this film, together with real pathos when terrible news comes through about the women’s loved ones fighting overseas. Marshall got a great performance from the movie’s star, Davis.After this, Marshall made the less happy army caper Renaissance Man, with Danny DeVito, then an enjoyable, serviceable remake of the 1940s comedy The Bishop’s Wife, retitled The Preacher’s Wife, with Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston. Marshall’s final film as a director was Riding in Cars With Boys in 2001, starring Drew Barrymore and Brittany Murphy: a likable, underrated comedy-drama in which she drew on her own girlhood and the spirit of her TV classic Laverne \u0026amp Shirley. Penny Marshall herself was an American classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa307387a798f9a28103fa69621acd98c5ad8e39/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e175083499d0d3f6ae3e09cec7bc1d","title":"new rules christmas dinner dont ask yorkshire puddings always wear party hat","story":"There’s no need for open warfare over the turkey – as long as we all respect some basic guidelines about how to choose, prepare and consume the feastThere is an exact moment that Christmas Day tensions peak: 12.56pm. In 2013, Magimix found it was at this point, after an average four-and-a-half hours of cooking, that, as frazzled hosts start to bring the dinner together, once happy homes from Aberdeen to Hastings kick-off like Gordon Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares. It need not be like this. Not if we all respect some basic rules about how to do Christmas dinner right. Read on and merry Christmas … hopefully.“Come on,” you say. “It’ll be great.” It won’t. Your hassle-free Christmas dinner means choosing from a set menu of high-profit, easy-to-serve dishes seasoned with the salty tears of bitter, orced chefs and served by disengaged young staff only here because of student debt. It is £50 a head to eat in a ropey chain pub, north of £200 to go “posh”. Everyone will hate you for it.Do not passive-aggressively announce you are “doing” Christmas, regardless of how inconvenient it is for everyone to drive, sleep over or cram into your flat. It is their Christmas, too.Whether that be on smoked salmon and champagne or a whole Cadbury’s selection box (because Christmas), make sure it is in good time. It is demoralising for hosts when bloated guests arrive protesting they are not hungry.On Christmas Day you are free, if not obligated, to get on it early. A poll commissioned by the ginmakers Mason’s reports that we start drinking on average at 11.54am, which is hugely beneficial to our collective enjoyment of the day. Hungover? Hoist yourself out of that despondency. Love Christmas? A nip will heighten your excitement. Despise this forced jollity? Magically, alcohol will make it tolerable, and you tolerable to other people.On Christmas Day, social media is a wasteland populated by tragic stragglers wishing their families “Merry Christmas!” on Twitter (you live with them, just shout upstairs) posing with their gifts on Instagram or posting on Facebook from a sleeping bag in the Boxing Day sales queue outside Next. Staring at a screen on Christmas Day, therefore, is not just rude, it is depressing. The people you love are here IRL. Enjoy them. Failing that, read a book.... with half-hearted offers of help, booze that needs stashing or constant reminders about who won’t eat dark meat or sprouts. It is infuriating.There has been a rash of news stories this year about people charging their families for Christmas dinner. The typical price is £30 a head, prompting one Mumsnet user to declare: “OMG! No! Fuck, that is horrible.” It certainly seems provocative, particularly if, as one couple told the Daily Mail, they price it to turn a profit. However, in an age of rising food costs (last Christmas, the average UK family spent £225 on food and drink), rampant gluttony (we eat on average 6,000 calories on Christmas Day) and soaring expectations (one woman told This Morning she spent £500 feeding her tribe), it raises the question of how we should share the financial burden. Money need not change hands. Instead, in a sensitively Marxist way (“To each according to need, from each according to ability”), a list of shopping and jobs (veg prep, bringing dessert etc) should be split among the party. Broadly, guests can then spend as much time or money as they wish on their tasks. The host must start a WhatsApp group to coordinate this now obligatory in building anticipation before any event. Accept the tsunami of nonessential chat that will ensue. Count to 10. It is Christmas.Confusingly, Christmas dinner is a late lunch, served between 2pm and 3pm. Go into early evening and guests will be too hangry or drunk to appreciate it. Traditionalists will be livid (“Your grandad didn’t vote leave so he could eat Christmas dinner at 7pm, Claire! We’re not French”), as will those who suddenly find that eating clashes with the Strictly Christmas special.Wearing a Christmas party hat is a sign of true maturity. No, it is not cool. You never saw Che Guevara, Ian Curtis or Tupac in a festive titfer, but who are trying to impress? You are eating with your family. They already know you’re a pillock.For one day, after a year of such ision, could we reach beyond politics to find some deeper connection with our kin? Giving it to the in-laws with both barrels won’t make you feel better and will change nothing about Brexit, Trump or Syria.They are the support band here, the B-movie, the Bake Off Extra Slice. You want light dishes, served in modest portions that, from shop-bought paté to jerusalem artichoke velouté, can be brought by guests and served quickly with little fuss. The host will go berserk if you start commandeering kitchen space to prepare a complex winter salad.One type of potato is plenty. Serving mash and roasted spuds takes up precious plate-space better occupied by pigs in blankets. Beyond potatoes, the core Christmas vegetables are commonly acknowledged as sprouts, parsnips and carrots. They offer a clear balance of sweet, mineral and roasted vegetal inflections to the meat. Go beyond that (peas, red cabbage, broccoli, mangetout) and your plate gets very crowded, both literally and in its flavours.Serving everything on sharing platters sounds festive, but it is a fiddly mood-killer. Guests will spend 10 minutes in near silence, shuttling dishes around the table as the food goes cold.Think: a savoury combination of pork, sage, shallots, chestnuts and pancetta. Breadcrumbs, onions and herbs do not a stuffing make. Serve one of those monstrosities dominated by booze-soaked fruits and your guests will be justified in mutinying.The receptacle is irrelevant. The age of the gravy boat has sailed a measuring jug will do. Just keep it coming. It is all gravy, literally.This is not Sunday dinner, they only really go with beef and the host is frantic.From mulled wine and bread sauce to Christmas pudding, there are many heavy, egregiously spiced festive foods created for Victorian palates that contemporary Britons find revolting. A minority of self-appointed keepers of the Christmas spirit take that revulsion as a personal insult, as if declining an eggnog is Grinch-like subversion. No. It is just a vile drink.As host, you may still be stuffed, but you cannot neglect that cheeseboard or first leftovers sandwich. For many, it is more exciting than Christmas dinner itself.

There were 73 minutes on the Emirates Stadium clock when an Arsenal supporter took leave of his senses to hurl a water bottle in the direction of the Tottenham attacker, as he walked away from the touchline. It hit Alli on the back of the head. There is simply no excuse for this type of thing, even amid the heat of derby passions.Alli had the perfect riposte. He turned to face the area from where the missile had come and flashed up the scoreline with his fingers. Two-nil to Tottenham. He had done more than anyone to make it that way to carry Mauricio Pochettino and his team one step closer to that elusive piece of silverware.It was Alli who made the assist for Son Heung-min’s composed opener but the best was yet to come. Fastening on to a pass from Harry Kane, who had just come on as a substitute, he found himself face to face with Petr Cech. Alli’s first touch took him a little wide but the second had jaws dropping to the floor. With the outside of his right boot, he fashioned the deftest of chips and when it dropped down and in, the game was effectively over.Arsenal had entered on the back of Sunday’s 3-2 defeat by Southampton that had ended their 22-game unbeaten run and they were second best again, surprisingly short of attacking ideas, despite Unai Emery’s constant tweaking. All the talk had been about whether Pochettino will join Manchester United next summer to replace José Mourinho. His focus, and that of his players, remains on what the season can yield for Tottenham.It was feisty from the first whistle, the tempo fast and intense, and it ought to have been Arsenal in control after 12 minutes only for Henrikh Mkhitaryan to miss a gilt-edged opportunity. He had burst into the Tottenham box after swapping passes with Aaron Ramsey and, when Paulo Gazzaniga failed to narrow the angle, Mkhitaryan was one on one and odds-on. The far corner gaped but Mkhitaryan dragged his shot and the goalkeeper blocked. It was a poor finish and it felt as though it had the potential to be a defining moment.The feeling intensified shortly afterwards when Son showed Mkhitaryan how to do it. Played clean through by Alli, the Spurs forward took two touches to set himself before guiding an assured finish past Petr Cech.From an Arsenal point of view, the goal was soft. When Gazzaniga cleared long upfield, Sokratis Papastathopoulos appeared to have the threat under control only to slip, get into a tangle with Lucas Moura and watch the ball break to Alli. Son made his run and the weight and spin on Alli’s throughball was one of the highlights of the match. Spurs went from one end of the field to other in two passes.As always in the League Cup, the strength of the starting teams was a talking point and both managers went stronger than would normally have been expected against other opposition. This was not an occasion for saving things for the weekend or the cluttered festive programme.Two -legged ties to be played in weeks beginning 7 Jan and 21 Jan That said, one omission was surprising. Where was Mesut Özil? Again. Arsenal’s best-paid player was not even among the substitutes and moreover Unai Emery said the reason was “tactical”. It really has reached the point where it can be asked legitimately whether Özil has a future under Emery.Pochettino’s 4-3-1-2 formation provided the ideal platform for Alli – in the role behind the striker – inviting him to sniff out the spaces between the lines but Christian Eriksen, too, was influential. He orchestrated the counterattack from which Spurs ought to have extended their lead on the half-hour.Mkhitaryan wanted a penalty following Lucas’s challenge after an Arsenal corner had been half-cleared but the Spurs forward got the ball and, rather abruptly, the visitors were up and away Arsenal looking open and exposed. Eriksen played the final pass and the chance was there for Moussa Sissoko. He blazed high.Back came Arsenal. Ramsey had the home fans cursing when he wafted a backheel to nobody when well-placed after Gazzaniga had sparked panic by finding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang with a clearance but, moments later, there was better stuff from both players. Ramsey’s volley from Alex Iwobi’s cross was a beauty Gazzaniga reacted smartly to brush it against the near post and away.It is hardly a surprise to see Arsenal behind at half-time and nor are radical Emery alterations in an attempt to turn the tide. Here, he withdrew the frustrating Mkhitaryan, introduced Laurent Koscielny and switched to 3-4-2-1. He would also throw on Alexandre Lacazette, who clipped the outside of the post on 62 minutes.By then, Spurs were 2-0 up and the travelling hordes could bask in Alli’s magic. Kane, who had not been fit enough to start because of illness, took a touch on his chest,  and, with the Arsenal defence dropping off, sent Alli clean through. The finish was a classic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f210285e0b9e437b7a4dac8ebe2ba1f7dc0bde65/0_73_1723_1034/master/1723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0f1cfe24b59cd2178063073c4639290","title":"chelsea bournemouth carabao cup match report","story":"Chelsea had hoped they might force passage into the semi-finals without calling upon Eden Hazard but, at present, they feel like a team reliant upon their Belgian inspiration. This tie had been threatening to run aground on a shootout when, six minutes from time, the substitute combined with Pedro in the clutter of the penalty area.Bournemouth only left him untracked for a split-second while Pedro wriggled to the byline, but Hazard is too good to be allowed any kind of leeway. The Spaniard’s return pass squirted back for Hazard to spit away a first-time shot which struck Charlie Daniels on the arm from close range. The deflection left Artur Boruc wrong-footed and beaten, the ball looping into the net to send Maurizio Sarri’s side into the last four.Emerson Palmieri and Olivier Giroud should have added to the tally in what time remained but, even so, this was a cruel way for Bournemouth’s attempt to reach a first semi-final to be snuffed out. A seventh defeat in eight matches was no real reflection on their play, with the home side nullified and unsettled for long periods. But their desperate pursuit of an equaliser, with Jermain Defoe flung on and the ball pinballing free in the hosts’ penalty area deep into stoppage time, came to nothing. Even with six changes from their win at Brighton, and Hazard resting his wounded ankles on the bench, the strength of the Chelsea selection was something of a surprise and perhaps reflected Sarri’s underlying motivation to break his trophy duck. And yet, for all the upbeat tempo imposed from the outset by a midfield bristling with intent, the hosts departed frustrated and level at the interval with Sarri, forever meandering out of his technical area and across that of his opposite number, a picture of agitation in the drizzle.Two -legged ties to be played in weeks beginning 7 Jan and 21 Jan His assistants, nodding in agreement as they huddled on the bench, bore the brunt of his exasperation. It was the manner in which the bright start had fizzled out which left the Italian enraged, the muscular energy and aggression summoned by Ruben Loftus-Cheek down the right and Willian’s eager running on the left, seeking to exploit the vacant space behind Steve Cook, having failed to yield a lead. That pair had supplied their best opening, Loftus-Cheek’s interplay with Mateo Kovacic having liberated the England midfielder who spread the play gloriously to the marauding Willian on the opposite side. The Brazilian collected and bore down on goal, only for Boruc to summon a fine save from point-blank range with a flailing right arm as he sprinted from his goalline.Yet for all that the Pole twice thwarted Ross Barkley as Chelsea monopolised possession, the clearer chances in a drab first half were arguably carved out by the visitors. Bournemouth’s recent dismal form might have explained the nervy start, a similar number of changes having forced Nathan Aké into midfield against his former club and the whole team feeling rather makeshift, but they eventually settled and threatened on the counter.David Brooks seemed to relish a more advanced, central berth. Lys Mousset and Jordon Ibe, who have both been relatively under-used in the top flight, unsettled retreating markers whenever offered the chance to spring forward on the break. It took a fine save from Kepa Arrizabalaga, offered a rare chance in this competition with Willy Caballero shivering on the bench, to deny the Frenchman as half-time approached.Then there was Callum Wilson. The England striker has impressed Chelsea, with the club appearing to embark upon a rather uncharacteristic charm offensive as if to woo the 26-year-old in the buildup to this tie. David Luiz had gone as far as to suggest Wilson could “play at any of the best clubs in the world”, with Gianfranco Zola similarly effusive in his praise of the forward. The locals remember his searing display in Bournemouth’s 3-0 win here back in January and, when Mousset sprinted clear of Antonio Rüdiger and fed the forward with a diagonal pass into space, those in the Matthew Harding stand must have feared the worst. Yet with a clear sight of goal the finish was skewed wide of the far post.That, in truth, rather summed up the anxious nature of too much of the finishing, with the closest either side had come to forcing an advantage a fizzed shot from Loftus-Cheek which kissed the outside of the post. Sarri eventually felt compelled to fling Hazard into the fray just after the hour mark, with Eddie Howe replying with the introduction of Ryan Fraser moments later.That at least opened up the contest, with both defences increasingly stretched and heaving to contain energetic opponents. Loftus-Cheek, enjoying his most impressive form in a Chelsea shirt and benefiting from Hazard’s subtle touch, squared across goal but no one could muster a finishing touch, while Wilson’s half-volley struck César Azpilicueta to prompt rejected calls for a penalty. In the end, it was Hazard who prised the teams apart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbdb995b33dbd4774e6af97196901274f1c2b59d/996_545_4055_2433/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60523b5d1b0269c47fbc7474b76546a5","title":"mike phelan manchester united return","story":"They say 24 hours is a long time in football but, even with his vast experience, Mike Phelan must still be pinching himself about Tuesday’s turn of events. Back in his home town while he takes a break from sporting director duties at the Australian side Central Coast Mariners, the 56-year-old took up an invitation to take a coaching session at Burnley College before answering questions from students about his experiences as Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant at Manchester United.“One of the students asked him what his dream job would be and he said it would be to be coaching in front of 70,000 people again, so whether he had already had that conversation I don’t know,” says Ash Aldersen, Burnley College’s academy of sport and elite athlete manager. “But it’s a dream come true for him. He said he’d come back from Australia just for Christmas, so I suppose he’s had an early present returning to United.”Born in nearby Nelson, Phelan made almost 150 appearances for Burnley before joining Norwich in 1985. But it was at Old Trafford that he enjoyed his most successful period as a player, helping Ferguson end United’s 26-year wait for the league title in 1993, before returning as a coach six years later. He was promoted to assistant manager in 2008 when Carlos Quieroz left to take over Portugal and won six Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup.But after a disappointing spells at Norwich as a coach and then Hull, where he was sacked as manager after less than three months, Phelan could have been forgiven for feeling forgotten until he received the call from United, asking him to become interim manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s assistant in the wake of José Mourinho’s departure.“We didn’t get much of an inkling about it either,” admits Aldersen. “But he was really professional in what he said about Manchester United and the ethos Sir Alex Ferguson created at the club. He actually said it was a very similar approach to what we have at Burnley College, which was fantastic. We have a big support network around the students to try to get the best from them. The level of his coaching was outstanding – you can tell it is something he really has a passion for.”With 50 A-Level students who are also academy elite level sportsmen and women, the college has become renowned for its innovative approach to helping aspiring athletes reach their potential, through tailored development programmes including nutrition and psychology. The British hammer thrower Charlotte Williams and the Doncaster Rovers goalkeeper Marko Marosi are just two of those to have progressed to the highest level, the latter benefitting from being coached by the former Burnley players Andy Payton and Gerry Harrison.They were also in attendance for Phelan’s masterclass on Tuesday, with United’s new assistant manager – employed in what he has called a “dual role” alongside his job at Central Coast Mariners – outlining some of his coaching philosophies in a special lecture.“My husband has texted me saying, ‘Woah he’s in Burnley College one day and then Manchester United the next’ – but it’s more seeing the students reaction to him,” says the principal, Karen Buchanan. “They absolutely loved it.”Phelan was also intrigued by the technology provided for students by the college’s new drone. “We’ve been using that information to show the students their positioning and to give them some tactical pointers,” Aldersen says. “He asked quite a few questions about that and stayed until well into the afternoon. He just wanted more really.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade471e0d99d707c914c96f101cf8c723b51f19c/0_89_4396_2638/master/4396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8a22c200869f851b2e65da3cd1b76a","title":"defence alexis sanchez jose mourinho tactics wrong","story":"David de Gea has been left increasingly exposed, as has José Mourinho’s reliance on Marouane Fellaini as a battering ramThere was a time when the prevailing attitude to José Mourinho was it might not be pretty but he got the job done. At Real Madrid that began to change. Why was he so obsessed by playing his “trivote”, his block of three holding midfielders, even against lesser sides? But still, the problem was at the front of the team: Mourinho sides did not concede goals. This United did: 29 in 17 league games this season, the fifth-worst record in the league. But the situation is even worse than that. David de Gea is widely considered to have surrendered his crown as the Premier League’s best goalkeeper but he has still made more saves than all but three. In other words, that defensive record could easily be even worse.The warning signs were there last season, when only four keepers made more saves than De Gea. United may have conceded only 28 goals last season, better than any side other than City, but De Gea’s excellence perhaps masked certain problems. Mourinho, no doubt, would blame the players available, and in the summer made great play of the need for a central defender who never arrived, but then, in 2016 and 2017, he did spend £60m on Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelöf, players who have never entirely convinced.Injuries have not helped but neither has Mourinho, whose chopping and changing of personnel and formation served to confuse the issue.Not everybody, of course, has to play the same game. One of football’s beauties is the fact there isn’t a right way to play, that there are multiple interpretations. But when pretty much every other elite side in Europe are capable of playing a ferocious pressing game, it does make Mourinho’s reluctance to press more noticeable. It may be that reactive football, sitting deep, inviting pressure and looking to counter, would anyway be problematic at a club like Manchester United, where the assumption is that the approach will be attacking. But it becomes particularly troublesome when the defending is as poor as it has been this season and results, the great vindicator, no longer justify the approach.In Antonio Conte’s first season at Chelsea, Eden Hazard was asked the difference between Conte and his predecessor Mourinho. Conte, he said, worked on “automations”, practising set sequences, gambits to be deployed when the situation allowed. Mourinho eschewed that, believing football too random to be worth preparing set moves. He prepared to develop in his players an understanding of the game such that they would make the right choice (at least as he saw it).That palpably has not happened and the result is that United in possession often look a little bewildered. Although there have been surges when they have overwhelmed opponents in the final 20 minutes of games even this season, there has rarely been genuine fluency.Against Liverpool on Sunday Mourinho switched from a back three to a back four at half-time, taking off Diogo Dalot, who had looked promising at right wing-back. In his absence, Andy Robertson romped free on that flank. Mourinho even called attention to how well he had played afterwards, praising the Scotland international’s capacity to make a series of high-intensity sprints. And yet at no point did he try to staunch that channel. Was that a deliberate ploy, deciding it was more advantageous to block up the centre even if it meant surrendering the flanks (which would be an astonishing admission of weakness from an United manager)? Or was it simple incapacity, a hope that players, if he really had instilled the right mentality, would be able to work it out? Either way, it did not work.There have been numerous questionable signings in Mourinho’s time at Manchester United – where is Fred? Has anybody seen him recently? But perhaps none that so summed up the lack of joined-up thinking as the signing of Alexis Sánchez. How was he supposed to work with Romelu Lukaku? Sánchez, for Arsenal and Chile, was at his best operating in the channel between centre-forward and left wing, either going from in to out or out to in. To facilitate that requires a mobile centre-forward, who is comfortable dropping deep. Lukaku is not that. He can start from wide attacking the centre, as he did to some effect for Belgium against Brazil in the World Cup, but the way United have used him is as more orthodox No 9, which means there will never be room for Sánchez to dart into.“I can imagine when the result was 2-1 to bring on a fresh Fellaini, I think they would be in big, big trouble,” Mourinho said after his United had lost 3-1 to Manchester City last month. Too often that has been his policy this season: keep the game tight, then toss Marouane Fellaini on and hope his size and aggression force something. It can work, as it did at Juventus, but the fact it has so often been Mourinho’s only discernible strategy speaks volumes. This is Manchester United, the wealthiest club in the world by revenue, and you would hope they had something more sophisticated up their sleeves than chucking the big lad on late doors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19fc3cfb7d2d97f8c08fa7c6947c7f896018fb7/81_562_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d69108fce01f95d410ed3c07ffb3fd2a","title":"arsenal v tottenham carabao cup quarter final live","story":"Top journalist David Hytner was at the Emirates Stadium and here’s what he made of events there:The first legs will be played in the week beginning January 7, the second in the week beginning Janauary 21.The draw will be conduced by ex-Spurs striker Peter Crouch and an Arsenal fan.The draw - we are assured - is coming up any minute now. The four teams in the slot machine will be: Spurs, Chelsea, Manchester City and Burton Albion, who’ve got to fancy their chances of being paired with a big team. Speaking to Sky Sports, Alli says: “When we came here last time we didn’t get the result we wanted so we knew how important this was ... It was a big test for us and I think it was a strong performance.” About being hit on the head with a bottle thrown from the stands, he says: “It makes the goal a little bit sweeter.” If I didn’t mis-hear, he was then asked whether he’ll be taking any selfies later. I really hope I mis-heard. It has to be said, Arsenal could certainly have done with an on-song Mesut Ozil, at least to come off the bench. Emery’s decision to omit him is understandable, but the performances of Ramsey, Mkhitaryan and Guendouzi didn’t help the manager’s argument. Iwobi was Arsenal’s best attacking midfield and he was substituted early in the second half, which was odd.Spurs progress to the semi-final with an accomplished, highly satisfying victory at the home of their spirited but ragged rivals. Their goals came from two beautifully crafted and executed counter-attacks, Alli creating the first for Son before scoring the second himself. He was also hit on the head by a bottle thrown from the crowd in the second half but kept his cool and is all smiles as he offers his jersey to a fan in the away end, while Arsenal’s players trudge off the pitch. The semi-final draw will be coming up right here shortly. 90+2 min: Kane spreads the play to Sissoko on the right. His cross goes beyond Winks before being cleared by Nketiah.90 min: Spurs seeing this game out nicely. “This is probably the last time we’re going to win at the Emirates,” sobs K Dot. “Thanks for the memories, Poch!” Every silver lining, eh. 88 min: Arsenal keep trying but are still too frantic. Spurs have been the stronger, more mature and more precise side.86 min: Alli booked for time-wasting, kicking the ball into the net after the whistle had gone for offside. Xhaka goes over to lecture him on sportsmanship while gesturing at the referee to show the yellow. 85 min: Rose does well to nick the ball off Nketiah after the young forwad took down another cross-field pass from Xhaka83 min: Eriksen has a blast from 25 yards. It’s another swervy one that Cech doesn’t feel comfortable trying to catch. He bundles it behind for a corner. 82 min: If you don’t want to know that Eden Hazard has come off the bench to make it 1-0 to Chelsea in the other quarter-final, look away now. 81 min: Maitland-NIles is down calling for treatment. He appears to have a bit of cramp. Emery will be hoping it’s not serious because he’s already made all his substitutions. 78 min: “I will take today’s result of part of Emery’s larger plan to add two (or) more fixtures to Spurs in the chase for fourth place,” quips Pete Mumola, who has abandoned all hope of an Arsenal comeback. He’s probably right: Spurs are looking quite authoritative.Spurs substitution: Lamela on, Son off. Slightly surprised by that. Thought Pochettino might withdraw Alli to protect him from any more bottle tossers.76 min: Xhaka booked for handball, or maybe for berating the linesman who flagged it up. 75 min: Aubameyang’s slightly mis-hits a cross from the left ... but nearly gets lucky, as he floats against the crossbar. And then out. 72 min: Alli embarks on a nice run down the left but can’t keep the ball from going out of play. Then he’s hit on the head by a bottle thrown by some moron in the crowd. Alli is angry, understandably. He turns in the direction of his assailant and uses his fingers to report the scoreline. Quite a restrained response under the circumstances. The ref trots over to advise him to leave it at that. We’ll be hearing more about that incident, for sure. Arsenal may already be trying to identify the bottle-thrower.70 min: Maitand-Niles is making lots of grounds down the right for Arsenal but his crossing has been inadequate so far.69 min: Arsenal exerting serious pressure, causing lots of discomfort in the Spurs box. Then Monreal goes too far and barges into Alderweireld, conceding a freekick.68 min: Monreal drives into the box and tries to pull the ball back from the byline, but he pulls it back too far, behind Lacazette.Arsenal substitution: Nketiah on, Guendouzi off. Arsenal switch to the Kitchen Sink formation.66 min: This is properly exciting end-to-end fare now. Spurs aren’t in the just clear yet ...64 min: Xhaka does well to shoulder Eriksen off the ball as Spurs threatened another counter-attack. 62 min: Aubameyang cuts in from the left after sharp work in the Spurs box by Monreal. The striker plays a cute pass to Lacazette, who, under pressure, tries to sidefoot it into the net from six yards. But it hits the outside of the post and goes wide! What a superb finish! Alli clipped a nonchalant dink with the outside of his boot over Cech after running straight through the huge gap in Arsenal’s defence to collect a pass from Kane. Spurs substitution: Kane on, Moura off. It’s Kane’s first appearance in this competition for three years, a sign both that Pochettino means business and is worried by Arsenal’s increasing momentum.60 min: Xhaka wellies the freekick into the stands. 59 min: Sissoko treads on Aubameyang’s heel as the striker sized up a shot from 20 yards. Freekick in a menacing position ...57 min: Eriksen dinks a pass over the Arsenal defence. Son scampers after it and tries to pull it back from the left byline into the middle. Cech intervenes.55 min: Eriksen send a wobbly freekick over the bar. It’s headed wide but Cech pushes it out for a corner. 55 min: Aubameyang tracks back to help curtail a Spurs’ counter. But he commits a clumsy foul, giving Eriksen a freekick a few yards outside the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box...54 min: Nice work by Maitland-Niles down the right, elegantly beating two men before digging out a decent cross. It’s headed away at the near post. 52 min: Iwobi, constantly dangerous, wriggles into the box from the left, then sends a low pass to Maitland-Niles, coming on to it from at the far side of the area. He takes a touch and sends a crossshot into the six-yard box but not with much conviction. Spurs clear. 50 min: Monreal floats over a hopeful cross from the left. Gazzaniga doesn’t drop it. 48 min: Arsenal have made a bright start to the second half, continuing the vibe they finished with in the first.If you don’t want to know the half-time score in today’s other quarter-final, look away now. Too late: it’s Chelsea 0-0 Bournemouth. Fancy some exclusive speculation from Hugh Molloy? “I’ve just realised that Ozil is going to join Juve in January,” says Hugh as he gazes at his tea-leaves. “Ronaldo loves playing with him and he’s an Adidas guy so they’ll probably chip in, the more tactical pace will suit, and he might fancy a guaranteed set of trophies and a bit of sunshine rather than the Arsenal bench.”It’s been an entertaining game so far, muscular and attack-oriented. Spurs deserve their lead - which came courtesy of a lovely pass by Alli and a fine finish by Son - but Arsenal have looked dangerous, if a little frantic, and created some good chances. This tie is far from over, especially with Lacazette liable to come on in the second half.45 min: Guendouzi practically demands a yellow card by chopping down Moura in midfield. “This is going well,” chimes in Guy Hornsby. “I’m sure we’ll try and Spurs it up at some point. Books-wise, I can’t recommend Danish Dynamite by Lars Eriksen, Mike Gibbons, and Rob Smyth highly enough. As a man of a certain age, it’s football gold, a tale of football romanticism.” I agree entirely.

Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30f87640b67b54cfaca527ca315a92e35d1deea/0_0_7360_4416/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=499838b2d14d4c84265696451af7f4aa","title":"some workers appear engaged but are pretending to work research finds","story":"Study warns that teams can appear productive in the workplace but actually behave in Machiavellian waysThere is the team full of hard workers and there is the group of moaners, but according to researchers there is another type of team in the workplace – and they are up to no good.Researchers say these “Machiavellian” types appear to throw themselves into group work while actually behaving as lone wolves.Amy Armstrong, from Ashridge Executive Education, who led the study, said the research was part of an effort to explore how to boost engagement at work.“Engagement levels in this country remain anaemic. They have been stubbornly flat for many years, and we have some of the highest levels of active disengagement in western Europe,” she said, adding that disengaged employees were vocal, took more time off than engaged staff and took up most of managers’ time.Since many employees work in groups, the researchers turned their attention to teams. They studied 28 teams of employees across seven sectors, from the NHS to transport, with up to 15 people in each team. Four teams were compared across each organisation.Based on measures such as answers to staff surveys, half of these teams were rated by their company as “highly engaged” – in other words, going the extra mile for their job – while half of the teams were flagged as “disengaged”.However, Armstrong and her colleagues found not all was quite as it seemed. By talking to team members the researchers found that two of the 14 supposedly engaged groups were in fact simply contented and doing the bare minimum. One group was actively disengaged, and four of the groups were “pseudo-engaged”.These teams, the report found, say and do things to look good but are in fact pretending – in fact, they have a negative atmosphere and the participants are more worried about their own interests than those of the group. Team leaders, the report notes, often resort to “organised fun” to bring try to build relationships – although the leaders themselves are criticised for primarily being concerned about how they are viewed by management.“When it comes to day to day work, stretching the workload to fill the time was one thing that we observed,” said Armstrong. “They were quite proud of the fact that they were playing the system and getting away with it. So if teams, for example, were doing shift work over a six-hour shift, they would boast that they were able to get the work done in four hours and spend the other two hours in their work chilling and drinking tea.”Armstrong added that there were knock-on effects. “You might get a new entrant into the team who actually comes in engaged but within a short space of time sees these dysfunctional behaviours around them and thinks, well, why bother?”As well as flagging problems with engagement surveys, Armstrong said the findings could help organisations to find ways to boost workers’ efforts.Armstrong said organisations should do more to reward teams rather than just iniduals, and that team leaders and line managers should get the message across that “there is only a certain amount you can accomplish alone, it is actually through collective and shared goals that we can reap productivity”."},{"url":null,"title":"the best dj mixes of 2018","story":"From Mumdance’s beguiling Shared Meanings to visionary blends from Ziúr and Eris Drew, our mix critics pick their favouritesby  Lauren Martin and  Tayyab AminInfluenced by psychedelic-soaked parties in the American midwest, Eris Drew transformed her identity through a shamanic relationship to raving. She coined the ecstatic, femme energy contained within “The Motherbeat”, and she is its high priestess. Neither a turntablist nor a house evangelist, Drew combines their respective approaches with rave and breakbeat bombs volleyed in with dramatic flair. Her sets at Chicago’s Smartbar ignited the scene, and the Thundering Goddess mix confirms what people have been finding out on dancefloors all year long: her studied sets show a thoughtful kind of pleasure-seeking, and her anti-cynical attitude is a breath of fresh air.Batu at Dekmantel Selectors 2018The producers and DJs of Bristol label Timedance perform techno with a soundsystem mentality, injecting dark funky house, jungle breaks and dubstep bass into the 44. Some of the producers have also been working the UK techno party circuit hard this year, their musical vision developing with a technical focus on propulsive forward motion allied to dubby reprieves. At Dekmantel’s Croatian outing Selectors this summer, label boss Batu was drafted in at the very last minute and delivered one of the best sets of the festival – three hours of powerful twists and turns, rooted in Timedance’s signature: those frenzy-starting, polyrhythmic drum tracks.British producer and DJ Midland is known for his pumping house sets, playing at clubs such as Berlin’s Panorama Bar and London’s finest gay techno rave, Chapter 10. But his musical knowledge is vast, and he’s skilled in weaving genres together – in his 2016 BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix, he found ample space for Nick Drake and Silver Apples among the club beats. In this beautiful hour-long mixtape, Midland explores music that blooms and wilts in cycles – a soundtrack to early sunrise, when bodies curl into one another and dream of how to shape themselves anew.Kyle Hall b2b Jay Daniel at Marble Bar, DetroitThe birthplace of Motown and techno, Detroit is mythologised for its musical history, but deserved as that is, a focus on elder statesmen such as Jeff Mills or J Dilla often crowds out contemporary talent. Two young artists carrying the city’s torch while creating new, thrilling music are Jay Daniel and Kyle Hall. Their loop-based hip-hop and soulful house and techno grooves feel like warm sunshine rolling across your skin – Daniel’s 2018 album Tala is a delight – and when they get behind the decks for a back-to-back session in their home city, they have a chemistry that just fizzes with joy.Matthew Kent’s Blowing Up the Workshop is a go-to mix series for experimental, downbeat electronics, with guest selectors bringing rare and unusual music from around the globe for each instalment. While the quality of curation is consistently excellent, making it difficult to pick a favourite for 2018, one mix that stood out was by Welsh DJ Leif. A resident at the tiny Welsh summer techno gathering Freerotation, Leif understands how to move quietly between sonic spaces. In his mix, he creates a gentle symphony, weaving together Gaelic choral singing, ambient synths and Cuban jazz piano.After a 40-episode radio series that saw him go back to back with unsung junglists, tinkering noisemakers and techno superstars, London’s Mumdance has continued to excel at whatever he’s tried his hand at in 2018. The producer’s mutative sound is skeletal and soundsystem-driven, caught in the liminal space between grime and techno. This year, his knack for collaborations led him to sculpting a ballad with Dawn Richard, crafting electronic blastbeats for black metal project Bliss Signal with James Kelly, and creating Teachers, with Logos – a track that revamps its Daft Punk namesake and lists the underground heroes at the core of his Shared Meanings mix. Boasting an exclusive tracklist, this mix unites the intensity of disparate styles found on music’s furthest frontiers, eschewing typical trajectories to deliver 96 minutes of beguiling unpredictability.Forest Drive West’s mix for Appian Sounds immortalises the kind of summer that Britain waits all year for and never holds on to for long enough. It has an air of purity and serenity coursing through the ambience, emanating from the meditative beats and smooth transitions. The east London-based producer honed his craft for 15 years before his music began to see the light of day: techno vistas released by Peverelist’s Livity Sound label and jungle through breaks specialists Rupture. It’s here, out in the sun alongside feathery percussion, beatless atmospherics and Reich-influenced minimalism, that his productions belong.Few show love for R\u0026ampB on the ones and twos like Ikonika. The Hyperdub alumnus has applied her garage-inspired sound to styles such as dubstep, techno and dancehall over the years, but it’s her love of grooves and crooners that shines through in her sets. It’s been a big year for her club edits, with Kelela and Ella Mai remixes featuring in her entry to the Discwoman series. Yet even as she moves towards different genres without the expected vocal motifs, Ikonika still finds a way to channel the bubbling ebullience and charm of R\u0026ampB through the seductive sway of extended family cuts and soulful tunes from the likes of house legend Kerri Chandler. Also loaded with unreleased teasers of her own making, it’s exciting to think what 2019 might bring.Berlin-based club maverick Ziúr brings her astonishing vision to Fact’s mix series. Her fringe approach to music brings a ersity in sound to match the ersity of selectors championed by the parties she’s thrown. She’s been known to shell down the riotous punk of her pre-electronic days in the rave, alongside aggressive industrial and spiky club music. True to form, there’s no telling what could come next as the mix plays, with Klein’s noise’n’B and Still’s organ chants thrown in to tumble with hardcore ragers and the words of esteemed activist Angela Davis. The result is a fierce and feverish hour of music where typical beat-matching techniques are relinquished to intuition and inhibition.Now-defunct Swedish experimental synth-pop group the Knife hold a special place in the hearts of music fans, thanks to their political intent and stylistic idiosyncrasies. One half of the duo, Olof Dreijer, has a particular resonance with dance music communities, traceable to two artefacts: his vivacious remix of Emmanuel Jal’s Sudanese call to vote, Kuar, and the zip present in his productions under the alias Oni Ayhun. Dreijer’s submission to the Truants mix series beams with irresistible joie de vivre, matching his own cuts with Portuguese batida, ghetto house and a baile funk take on Dua Lipa: a carefree romp that leaves nothing on the pitch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36b0dcf58cce8b4a2c8ba99b4ce540310636169/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da0d0f6f38297a97172c4ae72945a6d","title":"2018 a terrible year for facebook podcast","story":"Facebook has been hit by a series of data, privacy and hate speech scandals this year.

However, witnesses said her heckling during the serious points being made about the fragility of the institutions of peace created by the Good Friday Agreement was far from humorous and had interrupted a hushed respectful atmosphere in the ballroom of the embassy. Bell is from a village in County Louth near the Republic’s border with Northern Ireland, and has described herself as a former remainer who embraced Brexit because of the European commission’s “contemptible” treatment of Britain since the vote to leave the EU.In an interview with the  on Tuesday, Bell said the ambassador’s mention of a possible second referendum prompted her heckling.“A second referendum would have highly unfortunate consequences for this polarised and still combustible island. It’s not that mandates should never be withdrawn or a referendum reconsidered. If, however, a democratic outcome is to be reconsidered, it must first be respected. What could be more damaging than a second referendum if remain wins as narrowly as it lost the first? We would find ourselves in a precarious state.”She added: “Obviously, I profoundly regret the excessive robustness and perhaps lack of finesse with which I expressed my disagreement with the ambassador. I had, I confess, enjoyed a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat who is a staunch Brexiteer.”Bell said she worked as a customs guard on the Northern Ireland border in 2006 before emigrating and becoming a journalist. She writes mainly about lifestyle, fashion and travel.In an Evening Standard comment piece on dating last year the journalist expressed admiration for the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg. “I wonder if Jacob Rees-Mogg is popular these days because he reminds people of the good old days when men acted like gentlemen and women were treated with respect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999a0276b2c14b27c6d26b48701659f7c9d990bb/0_81_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3cd7ef759faabbd53952bcc801e575c","title":"jeremy corbyn accused of calling theresa may a stupid woman","story":"Speaker says Labour leader should be taken at his word over alleged remark at PMQsParliament descended into chaos on Wednesday as angry Tory MPs accused Jeremy Corbyn of calling Theresa May a “stupid woman”, which the Labour leader vehemently denied.The Speaker, John Bercow, struggled to maintain order in the aftermath of prime minister’s questions when Corbyn appeared to mutter the phrase to himself. He later said the phrase was “stupid people”.The video of the remark, made after May’s final exchange with the Labour leader, spread like wildfire among Tory MPs even as May continued to answer questions in the House of Commons.As the Tories grew more incensed, several MPs, including the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, accused Bercow himself of using the same term, prompting an angry backlash from the Speaker.The video of the exchange, which Bercow said he had not seen, prompted frenzied speculation on social media, including analysis from unexpected quarters.The deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie was asked by BBC Radio 5 Live to examine the footage and suggested she believed Corbyn had said “stupid woman”. The West Wing actor Rob Lowe, who is deaf in one ear, also tweeted that he believed Corbyn had said “woman”.In an attempt to restore order as dozens of MPs called points of order after PMQs finished, Bercow said he would review the footage.Corbyn later returned to the Commons and insisted he had said “stupid people” after May likened Labour’s unwillingness to call a no-confidence vote to a pantomime, saying: “He’s going to put a confidence vote – oh yes he is, oh no he isn’t.”He said the comment was in response to “those who I believe were trying to turn a debate about a national crisis in this country into pantomime”.In a statement before Corbyn’s return, Bercow said it was easy to see why people believed Corbyn had used the phrase, but he could not be certain and the Labour leader should be taken at his word.The issue brought together MPs from across the Conservative party, including critics of May, such as the remainer Anna Soubry, and the staunch Brexiter Mark Francois, who submitted a no-confidence letter last week.The Conservative vice-chairman Paul Scully raised the matter directly with May during the latter half of PMQs. “This year, when we’ve been celebrating 100 years of women getting the vote, do you think it’s appropriate language to call people a ‘stupid woman’ in this chamber?” he asked.May initially looked confused but then said all MPs “should be aiming to encourage women to come into this chamber, and to stand in this chamber and should therefore use appropriate language in this chamber when they are referring to female members”.While May was still in the house, the former Tory chair Patrick McLoughlin asked Bercow to censure Corbyn.“He muttered words which were quite clearly visible, accusing the prime minister of being a ‘stupid woman’,” he said, as MPs shouted “Shame!” and “Disgrace!”Bercow insisted he had not witnessed the alleged comment, provoking fury from some MPs, several of whom accused the Speaker himself of using intemperate language.Leadsom said the Speaker had not apologised for previously calling her a “stupid woman”. Bercow was reported to the standards watchdog over the alleged comments made in May.“Why it is that when an opposition party member found that you had called me a stupid woman you did not apologise in this chamber?” she said.To loud shouts of, “Apologise!” from Tory MPs, Bercow said: “I dealt with that matter months ago in remarks that I made to the House of Commons … which requires from the chair today no elaboration whatsoever.”Bercow said later he had looked at the footage and consulted professional lip-speakers. “It is easy to see why it could be construed as ‘stupid woman’,” he said, adding that that was also the advice of the professionals.Leadsom said the “country and this house will form their own conclusions” and that she “deeply regrets” Corbyn’s lack of apology.In one point of order, the Conservative MP Rachel Maclean said: “Read my lips: I do not believe him”, for which she was rebuked by Bercow.“It is well established that a member is to be taken at his or her word,” Bercow said.Labour MPs came back to the House to defend Corbyn and decry the state of the debate. Laura Pidcock, who recently returned from maternity leave, said: “I would like to say it was nice to be back. I just wonder what members of the public will draw from the chamber being used in this way?“I have heard from my constituency office today that residents have had to have parcels delivered today because they cannot afford to buy presents or food, and the chamber being used in this way is absolutely pathetic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958077564f10d2b2b0b97a65226b5f758da8ce02/0_0_4848_2909/master/4848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46af41642370ca2fd99f7d5e6924fc16","title":"what a no deal brexit could mean for the uk in five charts","story":"A simple look at the potential impacts on Britain of leaving the EU without a dealThe Treasury this week announced a further £2bn in “Brexit preparedness” funding, to cope with the extra costs of a no-deal exit, taking the total to more than £4bn.

I rang up the organiser and said: “I can come, but I’ll have to bring my baby.” He was eight months old and used to sit in a high chair. We get a lot of young mothers who are embarrassed to be there having a baby at the table immediately makes a connection. Straight away, you are talking about sleep, or lack of.Before I started, I thought I was socially aware. Actually, I had no clue. I was living in my own little bubble. My boys come home from school. “Can I get a snack?” “Of course you can.” It has been a massive eye-opener.Quite a few asylum-seeking families who come to our food bank had babies of the same age. The bittersweet thing is they are still coming, so we see their babies grow up. The mums remember my little boy. He will turn three in May.I see lots of single gentlemen in their 60s, who have lived in Sheffield their entire lives, had a health condition and can no longer work. They say: “It’s all fine.” Then you will hear the voice crack and the tears start. They say: “I’m sorry, I tried not to come.” At first I used to come out and cry. Now, it’s more like anger. Things aren’t getting better for these people, our guests. I talk to my boys about it. I hope that, by talking, the next generation will think differently.I worked in engineering all my life. My last firm, where I was manager, closed down. It was winter and it was so boring at home. One day, I went to the supermarket and they were collecting for Sufra. I asked if they could give me a volunteering job.It was so interesting to meet new people. If you help, you feel good. I thought: I’ll carry on here. It’s the opposite of engineering, isn’t it? There, you are working with machines, delivering stuff, forklifts, supplying car parts to other engineering companies. I work five days a week it’s nearly a full-time job. It keeps me out of trouble and I get exercise. My father used to do the same thing in Uganda. He used to help local people who were in trouble with food.There was one guy who asked for food. After he had his soup, he said: “I feel like a king.” It made me very happy. We tell people: “This is your right. You need it, so take it. Don’t feel embarrassed.” Anybody who walks in and says they want to eat, we give to them. Nobody goes hungry here.It was my partner, Liberty, who inspired me. When she became very poorly a few years back with lupus, she found herself having to use the food bank to get by.Last year, she started to volunteer. I’m a scriptwriter and she said: “You’re spending so much time in the library. Why don’t you come and help?” My instinct was: that’s not for me. I’ve never done much charity work. I wasn’t sure what it would involve. But it’s quite something working down there. It really gives you a focus. Everyone digs in and does their best. It’s pretty heart-wrenching at times. You have to bite your lip and offer support. I’m not as good at that as the more experienced people.Some people moan about the quality of the food. The biggest problem is that, because you can’t do fresh stuff, the quality isn’t great. Liberty is trying to get people to donate dried herbs and spices so they can be added to stews. But please, no tins of beans. We’ve got cupboards of them.For my MA, I researched food insecurity. I had no intention, when I came to the UK from California, to focus on that. But I read a lot of articles about food banks.After my degree, I felt compelled to do something. On my first day, I sat with the food bank users while they waited for their parcels. People can request items – whether they prefer tea or coffee, are vegetarian or don’t have a stove. If you are in food poverty, you still have preferences.I’ve been surprised by how open people are. Even if their stories are sad, it makes me feel more connected. When I talk to immigrants, it makes me conscious of the fact that, because of my visa, I am not eligible for benefits, either. I, too, would have to rely on my community. It’s only recently that I’ve felt London is the place I call home.I didn’t plan to set up the Hygiene Bank. In August, I sent a WhatsApp to some friends saying I was collecting toiletries for food banks. They shared it. I started getting messages saying: “I hear you’re collecting …” My partner has a shoe shop in Sevenoaks, Kent, so people dropped donations in. Then they said: “Have you got anywhere apart from the shoe shop? Have you got anywhere apart from Sevenoaks?” Four months on, we have 65 projects nationally and have provided 6.3 tonnes of essential toiletries.On my first visit to a food bank, a woman walked in with two children in school uniform and said: ‘Ooh, shall we get a toothbrush?!’ For these things to be considered treats was unfathomable to me, but they can change the world for one person. Who can present their best self if they aren’t feeling good? It’s isolating, humiliating. These are the words I hear all the time. If we can remove this one symptom of poverty – hygiene poverty – people can integrate. They can go to school, go to that interview.I met a woman who was living in a hostel with two children, getting food from a food bank. She had been married, had a home. Then her husband died unexpectedly – as did mine, seven years ago. Everything collapsed in my life, but my finances didn’t. I thought: “Imagine trying to deal with that on top of the grief.” I was left comfortable, which means I have time to do this. Part of me thinks my whole life has led me to this.When the food bank started, my husband and I were invited to the opening. This is supposed to be a rich country. But I feel blessed to be able to help. I make sure the area is nice for the clients. You don’t rush, you let them take their time. I give them a hug. Some are crying. You say hello, introduce yourself, offer a drink. We say: have a look in the bag. If there is an item you don’t like, we will try to swap it.You have to be ever so careful. We’re giving them pasta, but can they cook it? They might not have the money for electricity or gas. Maybe one of the group might bring along bread. A loaf of bread is a special thing. You haven’t got to cook it. You can just eat.I volunteer with Penny Appeal, which organises biryanis for the food bank. We distribute about 150 of them. They are almost always gone.I try to make sure we’re being joyful and put a smile on someone else’s face. You don’t talk to them like “a homeless person”, you just talk to them like a person. Sometimes I see people I’ve grown up with, gone to school with, and think how quickly life can change.The church that organises it gives a little talk before they distribute the food. A little prayer in Jesus’s name. Faith is a part of it. Being a Muslim, I’ve got nothing against this we follow Jesus as well as Muhammad.My wife is from India. She came over here two years ago and had this image of England as having no poverty. When I expose her to stuff like this, it helps her to understand. You can’t do as much as you want to do, but even a small action gives back to a community. Spiritually, it helps me, it strengthens me.I retired after 40 years in the NHS, working as a midwife with drug users and people who experienced deprivation. I could see the effects of not having money, not having a break in life.A number of people I worked with during their pregnancy come to the food bank, so I get quite a lot of cuddles. Some of the babies are mums themselves now. The way I think is: if you can do something to help, why wouldn’t you?Kirkcaldy is an area of high unemployment. There are a lot of second- and third-generation unemployed families. Last month, we issued nearly 1,000 food parcels. The public in Kirkcaldy is so generous.Anything that is a bit different is appreciated. People are so grateful for jam. Just now, we are getting packets of shortbread. It’s humbling to be able to make somebody’s day that wee bit better.We call it a food pantry the difference between us and a food bank is that we charge a fee of £3. There was a lot of consultation with single parents and people who are these days referred to as “the working poor” (which is not a phrase I like). We charge so that people feel they can maintain their dignity.The pantry is based on the Great Thornton estate. It’s like a shop. We’ve got fresh items – leeks, mangoes, onions, tangerines. We’ve got ambient food, tinned food, frozen food. We’ve got people making friends. When we get to know attendees, we can dig a bit deeper, find out what the issues are and hopefully develop a wraparound project. Every few months, we have cooking demonstrations.We’ve got about 170 members. We get new ones every week, which to my mind is very alarming, given the increasing numbers of millionaires. Many years ago, I worked for a private business and the boss was a millionaire. I worked my backside off for peanuts. I was 29 when I went to university to study social work. It just sits with my values. I enjoy my work immensely, but I’ve never seen it as bad as this in terms of the rank poverty.This is an affluent area. I’m from the north and the first thing I noticed was all the BMWs and Audis here.The senior school has what they call a links worker. One pupil had turned up at school and he hadn’t showered because he had no running hot water. The links worker knew I was attached to a church and asked if we could help, so we did a hamper for the family. Then I emailed the council to say that it was appalling that a mum was living in those conditions. Eventually, they got social housing.A friend of mine and I were talking about it and we decided to start a food bank in Wallingford. That was eight years ago – she’s now our manager.I grew up near Halifax in a very poor home. My dad liked his drink. We didn’t eat. The three eldest worked, so they got fed. But the three youngest didn’t. Mum would send us to the shop to get food on credit. I’m not complaining. I’ve seen a lot of life. But I never expected in the 21st century that I would be working in a food bank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e77fdbfa02ceaee8410ffc817627b05ac122d4/0_258_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9100b8bad15b37f6fb261e095af4abff","title":"f1 exploring london grand prix options ross brawn","story":"• ‘We’d like London to complement Silverstone, not replace it’• Grand prix would likely be on periphery of the city, not centralRoss Brawn, Formula One’s head of motorsport, has again raised the prospect of holding a race in London but insisted it need not be at the expense of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, where the contract ends next year.Brawn, who plans the future of the sport for the owner Liberty Media, said the idea is being revisited but any grand prix would not be in the heart of the city. “I think because F1 is a week-long activity minimum, the disruption it would cause in the centre of London would be unacceptable,” he said.“I don’t think Londoners really need to worry about us taking over the centre for a week. But there are things on the periphery that are being explored – not in the centre but Greater London. London is an iconic city with a massive history in the sport and there’s huge enthusiasm here.”In July, Sadiq Khan said he was interested in the capital hosting F1 and a spokesperson confirmed his position, saying: “The mayor believes it should be possible to organise a race in London and has asked his team to explore options with F1.” Silverstone is still negotiating with F1 but Brawn believes the UK could host two races. “We’d like to see London complement Silverstone, not replace it,” he said. “We could see ways we could make it work for both sides.”Liberty wants to expand F1 to include what it calls destination cities and this year confirmed a race in Hanoi for 2020. The chief executive, Chase Carey, warned in November it was developing a range of options should Silverstone’s contract not be renewed. The commercial director, Sean Bratches, has said a race on the streets of London would be “ ideal”.Hosting a race in the capital poses many problems – the logistics, noise, closing of streets, infrastructure and crucially, the cost. Using public money would not be acceptable but Liberty may explore different avenues.Its failed bid to stage a race in Miami was reported to include the waiving of the race fee, one of F1’s largest sources of income, so eager was it to place a grand prix in the US city."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15174e274882c8b9d3b83d13fd66e180eba4c8c4/497_181_2020_1213/master/2020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ed74f2bd4e92895566819e61452c6f2","title":"premiership 230m deal spending splurge","story":"Premiership Rugby has completed a deal thought to be worth around £230m with the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and has moved to ease concerns the windfall will be splurged on player wages.The deal was finalised on Wednesday after the clubs failed to reach an agreement at a previous board meeting. The initial approach from CVC, which made £8bn from its ownership of Formula One, was £275m for a majority stake but the clubs voted against ceding control in September.While some clubs such as Bath and Saracens are likely to use the windfall for stadium redevelopments, there are concerns other clubs will look to strengthen their squads and thereby inflate rapidly growing wages.Premiership Rugby hopes such short-termism will be avoided with the £7m salary cap to remain for at least the next two years and has urged the clubs to invest in “operations and infrastructure” having made a collective loss of £28.5m last year.“We have a salary cap in place and that’s not moving for the next couple of years,” said the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty. “We are investing in operations and infrastructure, that’s the key. We will be able to invest at a greater level and build the competition out further.”Premiership Rugby also eased fears over what happens when CVC decides to sell up. “They are expecting to be in this for the long term and they understand what’s required to invest and build,” McCafferty said. “I expect Premiership Rugby in seven or eight years’ time to be an even more globally followed business. That expansion needs support.”The Premiership Rugby chairman, Ian Ritchie, also denied the deal will affect the £220m Professional Game Agreement with the Rugby Football Union, which governs player release. Ritchie, who brokered the deal in 2016 when he was the RFU chief executive, described CVC’s investment as “complementary” rather than being a competitor.Danny Cipriani’s hopes of an England recall for the Six Nations have been significantly dented after Gloucester confirmed he would be sidelined for up to six weeks with a chest muscle injury.

Kaneisha, played by the If Beale Street Could Talk and Chi-raq star Teyonah Parris, is suddenly unable to stop dancing but stops when her white owner Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan) enters. They indulge in crude porn-like banter (he tells her to eat a cantaloupe he throws on the floor) before having sex. Two similar scenarios follow, each slightly altered: a black man is dominated by his white mistress a black man tyrannizes his white male indentured servant. This explicit interracial triptych fills the stage and is only broken when a word is yelled.A quick scene change and we find ourselves in a different world entirely. Giving too much detail would arguably spoil the play. However, we see that even in this new world, white voices and thoughts dominate. Harris uses this shift to show that even in a discourse that is supposed to center them, black people are still talked about rather than able to speak for themselves. To convey this, the black characters, when finally given the opportunity to speak, are only allowed to deliver words detailing their personal drama. Each is afflicted with sexual dysfunction due to historical trauma. For example, Philip, a biracial character, reveals that constant racist mockery led him to reject his black identity and embrace the neutral identity of Philip, a superhuman outside of these categories. This poignant, affecting scene shows how racism forces self-elimination.There’s excellent acting across the board but two performances stand out. Sullivan Jones’s Philip is brought to life with an equal amount of confidence and emotional vulnerability – it is easy to see how this man hides from himself. Teyonah Parris’s Kaneisha manages to go from complete subjection as a slave to fulfilling self-actualization as an architect of her own story in her final act monologue. Watching her transformation is thrilling. The proceedings are aided by clever stage design by Clint Ramos those in the audience see themselves in mirrors for the first two acts, and in the third act the mirrors move so only the performers are reflected. The costuming by Dede Ayite serves to undermine preconceptions from the beginning of the play. We see several characters wearing garments that would not have existed in the antebellum era – Calvin Klein boxers and patent leather boots. The lighting, designed by Jiyoun Chang, throws us in and out of this period from the opening flash to the darkened conclusion that leaves open the question of whether we have left the violence of this period.Harris, as a black queer playwright, has received not only due to the lack of voices like his in theater, but also due to the transgressive nature of his work. Slave Play seems like an attempt to put white fantasies under the spotlight. One can appreciate this attempt while also questioning its value. If the fantasies of white people are transmitted to us through film and weaponized as policy, do they need to be repeated in the theater – perhaps the whitest of white spaces? If brutalizing black bodies is, according to Ta-Nehisi Coates, America’s heritage, then surely the spectacle of this destruction is one its most popular entertainments. This is the through line from Birth of a Nation to 12 Years A Slave.The play may simply give white people yet another platform to gaze on black bodies exposed to physical and sexual violence while simultaneously patting themselves on the back for “surviving” the experience. The onstage mirrors are the perfect metaphor for the play itself: it gives a mostly white audience another chance to see themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4ecb02448127408ba108d658582a264a67a7bf/713_2032_1657_994/master/1657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c675cee79bb408c4c2b38bcfd57f17","title":"dames dressers and backstage dramas plays about actors in pictures","story":"Peter Duncan plays a washed-up panto dame in Park theatre’s new production.

At the most revealing end, users may be happy to enable “location services” for Facebook, allowing their iPhone to provide ultra-precise location data to the company, or they may “check in” to shops, restaurants and theatres, telling the social network where they are on a sporadic basis.But while users can decide to give more information to Facebook, Korolova revealed they cannot decide to stop the social network knowing where they are altogether nor can they stop it selling the ability to advertise based on that knowledge.Despite going to as much trouble as possible to minimise the location data received by the social network, the researcher wrote, “Facebook showed me ads targeted at ‘people who live near Santa Monica’ (which is where I live) or ‘people who live or were recently near Los Angeles’ (which is where I work). Moreover, I have noticed that whenever I travel for work or pleasure, Facebook continues to keep track of my location and use it for advertising: a trip to Glacier national park resulted in an ad for activities in Whitefish, Montana a trip to Cambridge, MA, in an ad for a business there and a visit to Herzliya, Israel, in an ad for a business there.“Some of the explanations by Facebook for why I am seeing a particular ad even mention specifically that I am seeing the ad because I was ‘recently near their business’.”The experience was mirrored by the  reporter Julia Carrie Wong, who discovered in April that the site “knows that I took reporting trips to Montana and Seattle and San Diego, despite the fact that I have never allowed it to track me by GPS”.Facebook tells advertisers that it learns user locations from the IP address, wifi and Bluetooth data, Korolova says.The academic argues that Facebook needs to offer the ability to opt out of location use entirely, “or, at the very least, an ability to meaningfully specify the granularity of its use and exclude particular areas from being used”.In 2015, according to leaked emails published by the UK parliament, the team behind a particular version of location-based advertising, which used Bluetooth “beacons” to track users’ shopping habits without resorting to uploading GPS data, was particularly concerned about appearing “scary”.“We’re still in a precarious position of scaling without freaking people out,” wrote a Facebook product manager in charge of the location-tracking technology. “If a negative meme were to develop around Facebook Bluetooth beacons, businesses could become reticent to accept them from us.”Facebook said in a statement: “Facebook does not use wifi data to determine your location for ads if you have location services turned off. We do use IP and other information such as check-ins and current city from your profile. We explain this to people, including in our Privacy Basics site and on the About Facebook Ads site.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6203a512b4c3d28f30f93f8c7f4459bb362a382a/0_137_3731_2238/master/3731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=544f3a24562cac1083d1de9b6dcc0db5","title":"filthy rich agents how shadowy elites conquered tv in 2018","story":"From Bodyguard to Collateral, nefarious conspiracies were everywhere this year, mirroring the murky political mood and dirty tricks of real lifeIt has long been a trope of TV drama that any crime committed has, in its origin, to go “right to the very top”. Down here won’t do, nor will the middle. It has to lead right to the very top. Far from lapsing into cliche, the notion of shadowy elites and elaborate conspiracies has intensified as a small-screen dramatic staple. The intrigue surrounding Donald Trump’s election campaign and the alleged criminality of EU leave campaigners in the UK (with Vladimir Putin all but sitting stroking a white cat in the background) have, if anything, left dramatists struggling to keep up in their own parallel realities.David Hare’s Collateral was a classic example of a web of intrigue that in 2018 seemed feasible rather than far-fetched. It featured John Simm as an MP in a Labour party in which Corbyn never happened. The leader is a woman who has a “Controls on Immigration” mug taken from Ed Miliband’s general election campaign. In the drama, immigration was a fraught and isive issue that had to be handled discreetly by hidden operatives. It all rang true, and the machinations cost a pizza delivery man his life. Simm’s judgment of the UK as in danger of becoming a “nasty little country” had the gammon-whiff of truth about it, especially in the era of the hostile environment. This was a procedural in which procedure was replaced – albeit clunkily at times – with a meditation on modern Britain.Last year, I wondered in these pages how TV drama was going to cope with the ascent of Trump, a far grosser and stranger figure than any fiction could concoct. The Good Fight, a spin-off from The Good Wife, provided an immediate response: make the actual Trump, rather than some fictional parody of him, a feature of the drama. Trump is hardly shadowy – his awfulness is revealed daily and in vivid orange detail under the spotlight in which he revels. Yet accusations of criminality and collusion are dogging his administration, and this was the stuff of The Good Fight, including a ricin letter threat, as the series struggled to keep pace with real life.Black Earth Rising also derived its potency from drawing on actual events – the horror of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Its creator, Hugo Blick, is an old hand at depicting shadowy elites – as he showed with The Shadow Line in 2011 – whose improbable characters, Stephen Rea’s Gatehouse in particular, belonged very much in the world of fiction. In Black Earth Rising, Blick dealt with tragedy beyond any creative imagination, and one whose aftermath he depicts as involving a conspiracy of silence, benevolent and brutal. The massacre itself, as well as the others it engendered, was only indirectly depicted, using judicious animation. It remains “obscene” (in the sense of offstage). The drama was really concerned with how such events are managed in the lengthy aftermath – the misplaced desire to erase history in order to move forward. But such erasures can only be managed and conducted at the highest level – and not necessarily in the public interest.Killing Eve tickled many with its bracing daftness and the subtle way it messed with the sometimes ponderous rhythms of BBC drama, suggesting that everyone making it was having tremendous fun. Yet for all that, its underlying proposal – of assassinations carried out simply with the intention of sowing chaos – is one that rings very true in 2018, as a smirking Putin and his operatives look on around the world the novichok poisonings (and the almost facetious denials of involvement by the Russians) and the brazen audacity of the Khashoggi murder, carried out in the expectation of impunity, spring to mind. Putin may have had a wry smile at The Romanoffs, too, with its tales of supposed descendants of the Russian imperial dynasty, especially when a mock execution, Bolshevik style, goes horribly wrong at the expense of Christina Hendricks’ Olivia.In an age of ever-widening inequality, the excesses of the superrich and powerful were laid all too plausibly bare in dramas such as Trust, which retold the, at times farcical, story of the kidnapping of the heir to the Getty empire. Then there was Patrick Melrose, which exposed the monstrous and unchecked sexual habits of a patriarch, a monstrous paragon of entitlement – and, in passing, the unmasked, obnoxious hauteur of our royal family, as personified by Princess Margaret. Succession, meanwhile, told the story of the machinations of a Murdoch-style media empire, whose head, played by Brian Cox, refuses to fade away.There were criticisms of some of 2018’s drama series – The Little Drummer Girl, the BBC adaptation of a John le Carré novel, based on the manipulations of an Israeli spymaster, has left many viewers bamboozled by its byzantine plot and multiple developments. Bodyguard, meanwhile, despite its popularity, alienated some viewers as Jed Mercurio, as is his wont, heaped sensational plot development upon earth-shattering twist, turning the dial to 11 time and again, as if obliged to outdo himself.For all that, the idea of active international espionage or prime ministers facing the sack for things they’re up to no longer feels like the stuff of conspiracy theory. The incredible has become credible. What is actually happening, what is being painstakingly investigated by Robert Mueller in the political sphere or in the journalism of Carole Cadwalladr, shows how clandestine, behind-the-scenes criminality is no longer the stuff of overheated, conspiratorial imaginations, but a reality that is being enabled and revealed in the internet age. Drama is doing well simply to be a pale shadow of the murky times in which we live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da456582d620365031a453d7a1fbee9d95b588a/0_51_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d82b983c462c0b193ed2d9b2a14427b","title":"metoo apu lucy mangan 2018 biggest tv controversies","story":"’s TV critic looks back on a year of shows that provided respite from the ‘raging bin fire that is the real world’Near the end of the fourth season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, when Lillian’s boyfriend, Artie, comes back from what Lillian has assumed to be the dead, he needs to prove to her that he is not a zombie. “Say something only an alive person would say,” orders Titus. “Okaay,” says Artie. “You can tell we’re in a golden age of television when you take a show like The Americans for granted.”It was true in 2017, and it’s even truer now. The drama, set in the Reagan era about two deep-cover Soviet spies who have lived as married US natives since the 1960s, finished its dense, intricate six-season run in January and – if its position of 25 in our countdown is anything to go by – is already fading from memory and being crowded out by new and better things.There has perhaps never been a better time to be a television storyteller. Opportunities abound. Netflix continues to broaden its slate and is estimated to have spent about $13bn (£10bn) this year alone. Apple is beefing up its video programming. Even bigger fish are entering the streaming wars: Disney plans to start a direct-to-consumer video service next year, and this summer Facebook launched its video-on-demand service, Facebook Watch. It delivered some fine fare, such as the compelling drama Sorry for Your Loss (a meditation on grief starring Elizabeth Olsen in an understated, but still powerhouse, performance) and the dark comedy Queen America (starring Catherine Zeta-Jones as – yes! – a renowned and ruthless pageant coach). It also secured the rights to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly. Facebook WhedonWatch?The UK has also been stuffed to its own gills with sumptuous fare. Throughout the year, we have been able to gorge on immaculately conceived and executed material in all genres. In factual programming, nature series such as Dynasties and numerous fine documentaries (such as The UN Sex Abuse Scandal broadcast at the beginning of the year or the recent Gun No 6) have given us compelling and sobering insights into our world. At the other end of the scale, comedy programming gave us the pure daftness of Cunk on Britain (30), the serpentine brilliance of Stewart Lee: Content Provider (50) and This Country (13), Daisy May and Charlie Cooper’s exquisitely funny, exquisitely painful account of the Mucklowe cousins’ life in the kind of Cotswolds village that doesn’t appear in brochures. Doctor Who (22) made a joyful, pared-back return and elsewhere in drama, there was Patrick Melrose (5), which was extraordinary in every way. And somewhere between comedy and drama was the glorious A Very English Scandal (2), a fantastic farce tempered by serious, sorrowful notes and held together by Hugh Grant giving the performance of his career as Jeremy Thorpe. There was also Bodyguard (3) that, despite being a curate’s egg and far from Jed Mercurio’s finest work, succeeded in becoming that rarest of modern phenomena – water-cooler TV – and captured the attention of the country for the entirety of its six-week run.Bodyguard’s popularity was proof, if any were needed, that – however fragmented we become as an audience – we remain collectively as hungry as ever for entertainment. Sometimes, it serves as a distraction from the raging bin fire that is the real world at other times, small-screen art can help us reckon with it. And there has been much to reckon with.The documentary Reporting Trump’s First Year: The Fourth Estate came 46th in our poll, but it was the Robert and Michelle King-created drama The Good Fight – seventh in the survey – that perhaps captured this era’s essence best, with storylines about impeachment proceedings, jurors being microtargeted with fake news on Facebook and a Department of Justice employee being fired after a negative tweet about the president. All of this was set against a background story of Diane turning to microdosing in order to try to make sense of the increasingly trippy real world. The Kings’ talent for rooting dramatic extremes in truth and letting them grow organically into a wildly flourishing whole remains unmatched.Other programmes have been reflecting our destabilised and destabilising times more obliquely. The Haunting of Hill House (21) surely spoke to our growing sense of being collectively gaslighted, while Maniac’s (36) paranoic vibe and tale of shifting truths as its characters moved through a mind-bending pharmaceutical trial, resonated. And the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale, of course, continued to portray a dystopian near-future that seemed to gallop nearer with every headline. Homecoming, starring Julia Roberts as a support worker at a facility helping combat veterans return to civilian life who gradually comes to realise all is not as it seems, fed equally off and into the same anxious, unstable mood.Often, however, it was the real world that intruded upon programming. The revival of Roseanne was cancelled after its star posted a tweet comparing a black woman to an ape, Netflix’s The Crown suffered from the revelation during a period of heightened sensitivity about the gender pay gap that Claire Foy (as Queen Elizabeth) had been paid less than her co-star Matt Smith. (The disparity was corrected after the row.) The Simpsons attracted great ire after its defensive response to criticism of the depiction of the Indian shopkeeper Apu. It was a potent reminder of how fast sensibilities are changing, and how easy it is for even those creators you would expect to be among the most progressive to find themselves left behind.But the greatest gamechanger was probably the #MeToo movement. In the real world, many actors were forced to reckon with allegations and past behaviours. Most notably Kevin Spacey, who was removed from the cast, and as executive producer, of House of Cards last November, halfway through filming the final series. The show went on this year, led by co-star Robin Wright. Jeffrey Tambor stepped down from his lead role in the transgender comedy-drama Transparent after allegations of verbal and sexual harassment. Transparent has survived his departure and will return for a final, fifth, season. It was, after a long time being almost (save sterling work by Laverne Cox in Orange Is the New Black) the sole representative on screen of trans issues, joined this year by the ITV drama Butterfly.It remains to be seen if or when Spacey and Tambor will stage their comebacks. Louis CK made his in August, nine months after his apology for years of – well, as it’s nearly Christmas, we’ll just call it “grimness” – in front of unwilling women on the comedy circuit. Maybe 2019 will be their year, although not if current trends continue. In the world on screen, the post-Weinstein environment provided grist to the narrative mills of many programmes, from Glow and The Good Fight to Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and 13 Reasons Why. It also left space in the cultural landscape that it seemed right to fill with women’s stories and those from other historically marginalised groups.As the final season of her show UnREAL played out, Marti Noxon launched two new creations: Dietland (based on Sarai Walker’s bestseller of the same name), about a diffident, overweight woman who gets drawn into a vigilante group that delivers fatal justice to rapists and abusers, and Sharp Objects (adapted from Gillian Flynn’s book) about the damage done to women and communities by sexual violence, murder and denial. Over here, we had the magnificent Lesley Manville in the magnificent Mum and other delights, such as Derry Girls, a comedy about a gang of teenage schoolgirls that showed them on their own ebullient, girning, glorious terms. There was Julia Davis’s latest horror, Sally4Ever, about a woman falling in love – or at least lust – with another of Davis’s sociopathic grotesques, and of course Killing Eve. Developed by Phoebe Waller-Bridge from Luke Jennings’ thriller series Codename Villanelle, it had two superb performances from the female leads Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer – a breakout one in Comer’s case – in roles that allowed them to be everything.Programmes by and about people of colour – or at least casting in a proportionate manner, a still notable aspect in a 2018 production – also benefited from the growing expanse of cultural space as more and more once-excluded figures, faces and narratives fell. There was the multitalented Donald Glover’s creation Atlanta Issa Rae’s Insecure, which continued to receive high praise and ratings Lennie James’ Save Me the drama Kiri about a nine-year-old child’s abduction that came out at the beginning of the year and slightly flew under the radar and Black Earth Rising about the prosecution of Rwandan war crimes.May 2019 be the year television consolidates the gains of 2018 and builds on them. More voices, stories, from more people of every stripe. A happy new year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d7be1add7c2c320832df496fb0590dca6d4b94/0_37_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df40a18a736cfae67082939ee3562cf8","title":"queer as folk to get american reboot","story":"TV show about gay men in Manchester to be remade with new characters and set in USThe US cable network Bravo is developing a new version of the hit TV show Queer As Folk, with the creator of the original UK series, Russell T Davies, recruited as an executive producer.The original show, which first aired in 1999, followed three gay men living in Manchester. It starred Aidan Gillen, Charlie Hunnam and Craig Kelly and ran for 10 episodes. A North American remake of the show, set in Pittsburgh, aired in 2000 and ran for five seasons.The new US-set reboot will be directed by Stephen Dunn, a 29-year-old Canadian writer and director. Davies told the  that Dunn had recently approached him to ask why there was no modern Queer As Folk tackling the issues facing LGBT people today. Davies said Dunn was “inflamed” by the current state of affairs, from Donald Trump’s election to the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.Davies said: “He wants to make a very new, very accessible show. He had a bit of anger of the world and the status of things.Davies said he would not be writing the script, but would be on hand to give notes. While the reboot was inspired by the original show, it would not be following the same script, storylines or characters, he added. The exact US location is yet to be decided.Davies added: “When we did Queer As Folk in 1999, it was a rare thing.” He said that when he wrote the character of a 15-year-old gay schoolboy, it was unheard of. “But you can now go to school and meet 15-year-old out schoolboys,” he said.He added that LGBT representation on TV had come a long way, but there were still many barriers to overcome. “We always want more and we are always opening new doors and rediscovering new areas that haven’t been explored,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a30f3d86c4395cf2ed7cc36364cef6282c69f0c8/154_0_2813_1688/master/2813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1847ff10fe80828e2fd07182e1ffa41","title":"the worlds most extraordinary christmas dinners review hark the 150000 cracker","story":"From Christmas in space to diamond-encrusted cracker cuffs, this was the sort of undemanding, off-beat fare just right for this time of yearIf you want to get back to the true spirit of Christmas, just sew the back end of a pig to the front of a capon. That’s how they do it at the Weald and Downland Living Museum in West Sussex, recreating a 14th-century festive centrepiece based on a mythical beast called a cockatrice (or “cokyntryce”, as their recipe has it). Lest you think it a wasteful exercise, they made use of the front of the pig and the back of the capon to create an “antitrice”, which is only mildly more disgusting.The World’s Most Extraordinary Christmas Dinners (Channel 4) was a seasonal mashup of bizarre, off-beat and outside-the-box yuletide meals, many eaten by people who were prepared to celebrate Christmas in July for the benefit of the cameras. We were shown Christmas on a nuclear submarine (not quite – the head chef went home for the holidays and it was apparent that no one was going to spend months underwater in order to film some sailors eating turkey), Christmas in a posh hotel and Christmas in space.Of course, it wouldn’t be Christmas without a little excess. At the five-star Rosewood hotel in London, where guests pay about £200 a head for their Christmas dinner, the focus was on a 3.7-metre (12ft) centrepiece made of gold painted branches, created by a “superflorist”, Kally Ellis. She was also in charge of the tree, which needed to be 7.6 metres high and 4.3 metres across to fit under an arch in the hotel courtyard. This necessitated a trip to a Christmas tree farm where they grow them on that sort of scale – 10 hectares (25 acres) of giant conifers, all cosmetically symmetrical.Elsewhere, Mark Hussey, a jeweller, set out to make the world’s most expensive crackers – or rather a pair of diamond-studded silver “cracker cuffs” that, once pulled, could be slotted on to the arms of a matching bejewelled candelabra. The whole contraption would set you back £150,000 and you would still have to buy your own crackers. One didn’t get the impression that a buyer was waiting in the wings – Hussey is still in possession of the £82,000 bauble he made in 2009 – but act now if you are interested, before he has to give the diamonds back.Anne McClain, an astronaut, is preparing to spend her first Christmas onboard the International Space Station. She arrived only a few weeks ago, but her Christmas dinner was sent ahead months back on a supply mission she chose her menu in April from a selection of pouches that included flaked, smoked turkey. “It might look like posh cat food,” said the narrator, “but pouches are the best way to stop a weightless dinner from flying away.” It didn’t just look like posh cat food it looked like it tasted like posh cat food, too.Jonjo Wring rears Indonesian black chickens – “the rarest chickens in the world”, according to the narration. They are mostly sold as pets – a prize specimen can fetch £1,000 – but the less-than-perfect ones could, Wring believes, make for an exotic alternative to turkey. The one he selected for dinner had but one tiny flaw – a dab of white on the tip of its beak. To me, this looked like something you could fix with a permanent marker, but Jonjo consigned the poor creature to the oven. As a roaster, a black bird is a bit off-putting – it looks burnt from the get-go – but apparently it tastes a bit like chicken. Well, exactly like chicken.Back at the museum, the cockatrice and his pig-headed mate were spit-roasted for four hours, before being slathered in a golden coating made from egg yolk and saffron and then roasted some more. “Conjuring up the three things we associate with Christmas,” said the voiceover, “gold, Frankenstein and, mmm, er …” Somebody deserves credit for the effort that went into that. And the blame.This was the sort of seasonal fare that comes in handy when your brain starts to turn to mush: deeply undemanding, sporadically interesting and larded with excruciating puns. You could, I suppose, have got angry about the idiotic extremes of wealth implied by the existence of a diamond-encrusted Christmas cracker, but it hardly seemed worth the effort. This is supposed to be the season of goodwill, a time to sit back, glaze over and enjoy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1483810d57b55f539df6f49d399f3f6a1051b25/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd7a8b90ac4d7801b9e5ea2f0bd1c11","title":"unaccompanied children tijuana us immigration","story":"Most come from some of the most dangerous countries in the hemisphere but the journey north exposes them to new risksFor years, Dora waited impatiently to turn 15, the age her mother had agreed she would be old enough to leave their home in El Salvador – where she suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her grandfather – and head to the US, in search of a new life.Her goal was to join two older sisters who had resettled in Los Angeles after fleeing the same abuse five years ago.But even after her birthday in May, Dora did not feel ready to brave the hazardous 5,000km journey, until local news reported that a caravan of migrants was heading north – and she decided to set out with a friend of her mother and her two small children.“Seeing them leave together … that gave me hope and gave me the courage to finally leave,” said Dora, who is now living at a children’s shelter in Tijuana, on the border with California.This year, more than 49,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the US border, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Jakelin Caal, the seven-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in US custody this month was with her father, but the group they were traveling in included some 50 children who were traveling alone.Most unaccompanied minors come from some of the most dangerous countries in the hemisphere – El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala – but the journey north exposes them to new risks: migrants are often targeted for rape, murder, kidnapping and robbery.Those who survive the journey are not out of danger: bureaucratic hurdles can delay them from pleading their case to US officials – or even prevent them from seeking asylum altogether. Meanwhile, they are forced to wait in border cities that have become battlefields in Mexico’s raging drug war.On Monday night, US border patrol blocked 15 Honduran migrants, including eight unaccompanied children, from seeking asylum at the Otay Mesa port of entry north of Tijuana despite two members of Congress traveling with the group. After four hours, the unaccompanied children were let in while the rest waited to plead their case.As part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on migration, the US government has put a limit on the number of people who can apply for asylum each day, a practice known as “metering”. Meanwhile, the Mexican government routinely erts unaccompanied children into the foster care system or simply deports them – regardless of the dangers they face at home.“It is a timebomb of tensions and vulnerabilities,” said Michelle Brané, the director of the migrant rights and justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission.Brané, who recently visited Tijuana, said metering was creating an especially dangerous situation for children who remain exposed to violence and gang recruitment while they wait to apply for asylum.At some ports of entry, metering has been in place for more than two years, but in the past six months, it has become the standard across the US-Mexico border, according to a report released this month by three research institutes.Nowhere is the precarious situation for unaccompanied children more visible than in Tijuana, which has been overwhelmed by thousands of asylum seekers in the final months of 2018.According to an unofficial list of asylum seekers, some 5,000 people are currently waiting to present their claim, with an average waiting time of 12 weeks, according to the report by the Robert Strauss Center’s Mexico Security Initiative, UC San Diego’s Center for US-Mexican Studies and the Migration Policy Centre.Child protection groups in Tijuana estimate there are hundreds of unaccompanied children in the city, but the figure is hard to confirm because minors traveling alone are hesitant to identify themselves for fear of gangs, traffickers – and the Mexican government.Mexican child protection officers are obliged to take unaccompanied minors into custody, where they are filtered into foster care or deported.“Even if they are lucky enough to get information about the asylum system in Mexico, they very often still don’t have access to actually apply, but then even beyond that, they don’t get any information about the United States,” said Brané.Those unaccompanied children who make it to the San Ysidro port of entry in Tijuana can also still be turned away by US Customs and Border Protection agents. According to Amnesty International, the border patrol has since April turned away at least five unaccompanied children seeking asylum at San Ysidro.DHS said in an emailed statement: “No one is being denied the opportunity to make a claim of credible fear or seek asylum.”But on a visit to Tijuana last month, the US congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, intervened when five asylum seekers, including two unaccompanied children, were stopped from presenting themselves for asylum at the border by US officials.“It shouldn’t take intervention from a Member of Congress and an incredibly compassionate Border Patrol Chief for those fleeing violence and persecution to seek asylum in the United States,” Jayapal tweeted after the incident.When Dora tried to apply for asylum at San Ysidro, she was intercepted by Mexican immigration agents who sent her to the children’s shelter where she now spends the day watching television, playing cards and hanging out with new friends.She is not able to contact her family because their cell service is patchy in the city where they live. She hopes eventually to apply for asylum again.With her dream of reaching Los Angeles just out of reach, Dora said she was still grateful to have escaped the chaotic environment around her grandfather.“When he wasn’t drinking it was fine, but it got to be every day,” said Dora.“He would hit me hard and then when my mom would try to intervene, he would hit her. You never knew exactly what would set him off. Living on edge like that, it’s constant fear and anxiety. I feel much more at peace here, like it’s going to be OK.”But Jenny Villegas, an organizer at the advocacy group Caracen who has been working closely with unaccompanied children in Tijuana, said that many of the youngsters are only just realizing the scale of the risks they still confront.“Some have faced very terrible things on their way, some have been kidnapped by cartels,” Villegas said. “So they are dealing with a lot. And on top of that, they are realizing it’s not as easy as they thought it would be when they got here.”Without adult supervision, unaccompanied children are very vulnerable to gangs and traffickers in Tijuana, where homicides soared to a new high in 2017 because of gang violence. “There are active gangs here who recruit minors,” she said.Many of the unaccompanied children who reach the city are unaware of the risks and obstacles they still face, preoccupied as they are by homesickness and the violence they have left behind.Orlin, 17, and his brother Marcos, 15, described a steady life with their grandparents in Zamora in northern Honduras, until they declined to join a gang – and were given two weeks to leave town.“Honduras is a beautiful country but the gangs make it an ugly place to be,” said Marcos, speaking in the same shelter. “I don’t ever want to go back.”The two brothers had left school before age 10 because the costs of pencils, backpacks and notebooks was too much of a financial burden for their family.“We almost never leave the house because of the gangs – we definitely don’t go out at night, but during the day even we really only go out if we have to run to the store or something,” Orlin said.Orlin has two round scars on his knee and a third on his left thigh from being shot by gang members who robbed him two years ago .“That really shook me,” he said. “Our father had been killed by the gangs and I didn’t want to be next.”The ultimatum from the gangsters came just before the first caravan set out from Honduras.The two brothers have family scattered across the US and said they hope to become fluent in English, work in construction and eventually make their own families.Orlin nodded northwards, towards the US border. “The dream – our dreams – are there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad1502ebeb3044b937344fab87a10295e6e09437/0_92_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c091c5dcd65b5b9b12d49b2c357df4eb","title":"immigration rules uk germany economy job seekers opposing camps","story":"While Britain seems to put politics above the economy, Germany’s new law welcomes foreign job-seekersTwo European countries announced radical overhauls of their immigration rules on Wednesday, but there the similarity ended.Britain, where concerns about long-term impacts of immigration helped drive the 2016 vote to leave the European Union, billed its stricter regime as “a route to strengthened border security and an end to free movement”.Germany, however, facing such a shortage of workers that is threatening economic growth, said it was easing immigration rules to attract more foreign job-seekers.In an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the British home secretary, Sajid Javid, stressed that the Conservatives’ 2017 election manifesto had made clear the party’s “commitment to bring net migration down”.His counterpart in Germany, Horst Seehofer, said: “We need manpower from third countries to safeguard our prosperity and fill our job vacancies.” The economy minister, Peter Altmaier, hailed the new law – keenly awaited by business - as historic.Britain’s priority appears primarily to be establishing a system of tough controls capable of keeping certain people out. Business has accused the government of putting a political imperative for restriction before the needs of the economy.In contrast, by introducing looser visa procedures and reducing red tape Germany’s emphasis appears to be on making it easier for certain people to enter and to stay. Some in Angela Merkel’s conservative alliance and in the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have said such a move ignores public concerns about immigration.The UK’s system does not put a cap on numbers but aims to reduce annual net migration to “sustainable levels”. It requires skilled workers to earn a minimum salary, to be decided next year. After Brexit there would be no more special treatment for EU citizens a transitional temporary worker scheme would allow them, and workers of any skill level from other “low risk” countries, to enter Britain without a job offer for up to 12 months.Business leaders have warned that the system will leave the UK poorer, depriving industry of a migrant workforce on which it has depended. The proposed £30,000 salary threshold for skilled workers would leave hospitals, the contstruction and hospitality sectors, manufacturing, agriculture and logistics desperately short of labour, they said.Germany’s Fachkräftezuwanderungsgesetz, or skilled labour immigration law, will allow skilled workers such as cooks, metallurgy workers and IT technicians to enter the country for six months to try to find a job, provided they can support themselves financially.More controversially, the law will offer the prospect of permanent residency to asylum seekers who have a job and speak good German but currently face deportation if their asylum applications are turned down.Immigration has been a key political issue in Germany since Europe’s 2015 migration crisis, when the country absorbed more than 1 million mostly Muslim refugees and migrants, sparking a xenophobic backlash and surge of support for the anti-immigration AfD in federal and regional elections.Ministers stressed the new rules were a “pragmatic solution” to a pressing economic problem. The AfD said they would fuel immigration, providing “a fresh incentive for people from around the world to come”. In Germany, however, those politics have not, so far, prevailed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b61f609ab2d0924453bd61a9ef985cab14a185b4/45_140_3424_2055/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b3de80ccdd3e1c9d35f9c54bd56623","title":"italy avoids eu sanctions after reaching 2019 budget agreement","story":"Italy has managed to avert EU sanctions after reaching a compromise with the European commission over its 2019 budget.“Over the last few weeks we worked to bring the positions closer without ever moving backwards with respect to the objectives the Italian people set us in the 4 March election,” Conte said.However, Valdis Dombrovskis, a European commission vice-president, described the agreement with Italy as a “borderline compromise” that fails to provide long-term solutions to the country’s economic problems.“But it enables us, for now, to avoid opening a debt procedure, as long as the negotiated measures are fully applied,” he said at a press conference in Brussels.He said the commission would closely monitor whether the Italian parliament voted through the budget agreed with the EU.Italy’s industry minister, Dario Galli, said last week the bulk of the spending cuts needed to meet the lower deficit target would be most likely to hit universal basic income, intended to give €780 (£700) a month to the unemployed, and the proposal to cut the retirement age.

The Government has unveiled further contingency plans to cope with a potential no-deal Brexit, identifying affected sectors that would require up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation.The no-deal plans, published late on Wednesday night, would include the purchase of land at Dublin Port and Rosslare to prevent congestion from new customs, sanitary and animal health checks at the sea ports. The plan aims to tackle how Ireland would handle a no-deal scenario where the United Kingdom would be “a third country” outside the European Union from March 2019, would be no longer represented in EU institutions and would fall outside EU rules.“For Ireland, a no deal Brexit would potentially involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral impacts,” the Government says in the 133-page contingency plan.“Grappling with the enormous range of impacts both in the immediate short term and in the longer term will involve difficult and significant choices of a practical, strategic and political nature.”The plan says Brexit has the potential to impact every element of the functioning economy, from trade flows and supply chains to economic and business operations and consumer confidence and spending.“A no-deal Brexit would be an exceptional economic event which would be met with exceptional measures to support the continued operation of the Irish economy and our international trading links,” the report says.The Government has produced the plan 100 days ahead of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU as continuing political rifts in London over the proposal withdrawal agreement increase the possibility of no deal being agreed. Speaking at Government Buildings after the document was published, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said avoiding a hard border after a no-deal exit would be “a very difficult thing to do”, though he reiterated the Government’s insistence that no preparations would be made for a border. The plans identify 45 issues that will require legislative changes in domestic primary and secondary legislation, though the Government would try to wrap these bills into as few pieces of legislation as possible.The report says the necessary legislative measures required in a no-deal scenario will be introduced in the Oireachtas in early January.The Government has asked all ministers to identify non-Brexit legislation that is “absolutely essential for enactment” before the end of March 2019 in order to plan the parliamentary schedule in the comings ahead.“Given the proximity of the date of Brexit, it is now necessary in some cases to move from contingency planning to taking actions to mitigate the consequences of a no-deal Brexit,” the Government states. A committee of senior officials is drawing up proposals for the drafting and enactment of the necessary emergency legislation, the document states. “This will be considered by the Government early in the New Year before being presented to the Dáil,” says the plan, described as a “living document” that will be “updated and developed” over the coming months. The Cabinet will discuss the increasing risks around a no-deal scenario again at a meeting scheduled for Thursday, January 3rd.The potential new legislation required in a no-deal scenario covers a erse variety of areas, including primary legislation in sectors ranging from healthcare, railway safety and broadcasting to secondary legislation for areas from justice and security to sea fisheries and maritime jurisdiction to the movement of pets.A site has been identified at Dublin Port, the country’s busiest seaport, for an additional 33 inspection bays for trucks coming off ships and parking for 270 trucks to ensure parked vehicles do no halt other port traffic.The additional infrastructure required includes new office space for an additional 144 staff at the port, a dedicated border control post for live animals and a new public office with eight counters or hatches.Rosslare port will require 13 inspection bays for trucks disembarking ships, parking for 35 trucks, a dedicated border control post for live animals and a public office with six counters or hatches. The Government repeated that its commitment to preventing the re-emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland remains “of the highest priority.”In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, there would inevitably be questions” over the protections offered by the 1998 Belfast Agreement and “to the rights and benefits enjoyed by the people of Northern Ireland,” the report says.The Government acknowledges that there would be “important gaps” in current arrangements for co-operation in policy and justice which would have to be addressed, notably the absence of the European Arrest Warrant arrangements for extradition.The report says that the UK landbridge - the critical road link between Ireland and continental Europe for Irish traders - would in a no-deal scenario be subjected to severe delays, at least in the initial period.“Dover-Calais has been identified as a particular bottleneck. This will have a knock-on impact on goods travelling tofrom Ireland and the rest of the single market,” the plan says.In aviation, the Government says that in a no-deal scenario, the focus is on the risk of “an abrupt interruption to flights between the UK and the EU due to the absence of traffic rights and issues relating to the validity of operating licences or aviation safety certificates.”A key issue in the area of healthcare will be to ensure that there is a “minimum disruption” to health services and that “essential services are maintained on a cross-border, all Ireland and Ireland-UK basis.”The Government says that work is ongoing with pharmaceutical wholesalers to assess the risks to medicine product lines “that may be vulnerable as a result of a no-deal Brexit and put in place the necessary mitigation measures to ensure continuity of supply.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Joanna BellTwitterA Daily Mail journalist who was ejected from a party at the Irish embassy in London for heckling the Ambassador’s speech said she was annoyed at his suggestion of a possible second Brexit referendum.Joanna Bell, a Daily Mail journalist who is originally from a village near Dundalk, Co Louth, was asked to leave the Embassy’s Christmas party on Monday evening after disrupting the speech given by Irish Ambassador Adrian O’Neill.Ms Bell interrupted Mr O’Neill’s address at the festive drinks reception after he made comments intended to be humorous on the possibility of the UK’s departure from the EU being put to a second vote.When the Ambassador spoke about the risks to the Northern Ireland peace process from Brexit and the potential for a hard border affecting Border communities, Ms Bell reportedly shouted: “Bor-ing!”At another point, she shouted “Brexit!” before being escorted from the room at the Embassy near Westminster.The Embassy’s “Politics \u0026amp Press” party, a popular event in London’s social calendar for politicos and journalists, was attended by prominent figures from politics and the media. British chancellor Philip Hammond, Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley and Jonathan Stephens, permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Office, Lord Jeffrey Archer and his wife Mary, and former UK defence secretary Michael Fallon were among the guests at the event.One attendee said the journalist’s outburst was “totally out of sync with the people in the room” who were at the event on business, including some who were there because of the importance of the Brexit process.Ms Bell, a former Irish customs officer, voted for the UK to remain in the EU in the Brexit referendum but describes herself now as “a staunch Brexiteer” and a “big advocate of democracy” in support of the 2016 vote.She believes that European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and others in the EU have behaved in a “contemptible manner” towards UK prime minister Theresa May and this has made her switch her support.Suggestions of a second Brexit referendum have reminded her of how Irish voters were asked to vote again on the Lisbon Treaty referendum in 2009.Speaking to The , Ms Bell said her unfortunate ejection from the Embassy followed a\u0026nbspresponse to the suggestion\u0026nbspby the Ambassador that a second Brexit referendum should take place.\u0026nbsp“A second referendum would have the highly unfortunate consequences for this polarised and still combustible island. It’s not that mandates should never be withdrawn or a referendum reconsidered,” she said.“If, however, a democratic outcome is to be re-considered, it must first be respected. What could be more damaging than a second referendum if Remain wins as narrowly as it lost the first? We would find ourselves in a precarious state.”However, witnesses at the reception insisted that the Ambassador had never said that the British should hold a second referendum, but rather had made a humorous remark about its future options.Ms Bell in a statement to The  apologised unreservedly to the Ambassador and his wife for disrupting their party.“Obviously, I profoundly regret the excessive robustness and perhaps lack of finesse with which I expressed my disagreement with the ambassador,” she said.“I had, I confess, enjoyed a good lunch with an eccentric aristocrat who is a staunch Brexiteer.”Ms Bell said she worked as a customs guard on the Border in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth in 2006, based out of Dundalk.The Department of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the incident at the Embassy.Mr O’Neill, known for his calm and unflappable manner, is said to have noticed Ms Bell’s interjection but “handled it fairly diplomatically,” said one attendee.In his speech, the Ambassador told guests that he was grateful for the “goodwill and friendship” the embassy has benefited from in London.He also thanked them “for that sense of friendship towards the embassy, towards Ireland and above all towards continued warm and friendly relations between our two countries”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt’s the last day of the Dáil session and Leo Varadkar is looking forward to taking some time off. He starts the morning with a visit to a secondary school in Ringsend. In the year since he became Taoiseach, his ability to indulge in small talk has improved in leaps and bounds. But there is still some way to go. He asks a group of students about their exams. “How-how-how are they goin’? I remember doing Christmas exams.” “But, em . . . and you finish then on Friday?”“Same,” nods the Taoiseach, on their level now. “Same here.” All set for Funderland, no doubt.And then the Taoiseach is, like: “So, em, looking forward to it. Hope you are too.”Mercifully, a teacher intervenes. “That’s great, thanks very much.” You would think Leo might have left well enough alone at this point. But no. He’s totally smashing this small-talk thing.He says a few words about international relations (because he is launching the Government’s Global Schools programme) and then looks over to where his buddy, the Minister for Housing, is seated. Ringsend College is in Eoghan Murphy’s Dublin Bay South constituency. “Do you recognise Eoghan?” the Taoiseach smilingly asks the students, because he’s one of their mates now.“He’s, eh, he’s your local TD,” perseveres Leo, grinning. Unlike Eoghan, who is glowering. Whatever about the students, or mortified Murph, the Taoiseach appears to be enjoying himself. “Do you know the names of any of the other TDs in the area?” he wonders. “They’re very shy,” interjects the kindly teacher. But Leo doesn’t get the hint.“So we’ll take a question from Abbie?” suggests the teacher, valiantly trying to move things along. But Leo, in the discomfited presence of his dudemeister Murph, can’t resist. “That wouldn’t happen in Blanchardstown.” Strained laughter followed by another awkward pause. So the teacher – she deserves a medal – swoops in. “So, em, Abbie is just here. . .”Finally, he stops.But before Leo could escape for his hols, he had to put in one more stint at Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil. It was a relatively low-key session, with the Ceann Comhairle dispensing Christmas good wishes and the party leaders following suit. But we had no novelty Christmas tie this year from Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh, disappointing all the kiddies around the country who tuned into RTÉ to see what tune it would play this year. They all looked a bit tired on the Sinn Féin benches, probably because they had their Christmas drinks the night before. In an historic first, the Shinners invited members of the media to enjoy a drink with them in the Dáil bar before they left for their knees-up. This was hailed as a milestone in the progression of the party.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil treated the hacks to more free drink upstairs in McGrattan’s bar near Government Buildings. Micheál Martin described it as “a very agreeable night” in the course of his Christmas felicitations to the chamber. Before the event, it was rumoured that the Fianna Fáil leader exhorted some of his more difficult charges to attend the drinks and talk to the members of the press because it would be a nice change for him to see them conversing before his eyes as opposed to behind his back, as they usually do.We hear an anti-abortion Fine Gael Senator stumbled upon the gathering by accident, and was momentarily confused. “This isn’t the Oireachtas Human Dignity Group,” he was heard to utter, before leaving for another part of the pub where members of the cross-party group – founders include Senator Rónán Mullen – were letting their hair down. A great night was had by all, but group members Mattie McGrath and fellow TDs Carol Nolan and Michael Collins were up bright and early so they could take part in a plan to occupy the Baggot Street offices of KBC bank in protest over the eviction of people from a house in Co Roscommon last week. The three, who were part of a wider protest, said they were also concerned with the way the bank deals with people in mortgage arrears.Meanwhile, back in the chamber in the post-luncheon period, the Dáil was hearing statements on the European Council meeting earlier this month. They were well under way when Mick Wallace arrived to speak. He was very full of the Christmas cheer. “Good to see you here, Taoiseach. Don’t normally see you here for Euro statements, you usually abscond the place before then.”Leo was gathering up his files. It was past three and he had been in the chamber since midday. Mick didn’t want him to go just as he was about to talk about Brexit and the announcement by Irish Ferries that the company is “unlikely” to continue sailings between Rosslare and France next year.He pleaded with the Taoiseach.“What, are you going already, are ya? Ah, come on. Eh, com’ere, sit down for a minute, come on, come on, sit down!”“I did stay here for everyone who was here for my contribution,” said the Taoiseach, on his feet.“Please. Wha? It won’t kill ya to sit down,” wheedled Mick.“Merry Christmas,” smiled Leo, skipping the joint.“What are you like? Em, oh, God help us,” spluttered Mick. “Anyway, listen. . .” And the TD for Wexford, wherein resides the port of Rosslare, got on with his speech and then vanished too.Later in the evening, the Taoiseach invited his Cabinet to join him for mulled wine and mince pies in Government Buildings.We don’t know if the Ministers of State were invited along too. If so, the guests will have wished Kilkenny’s John Paul Phelan all the best for his big day – the Minister of State for Local Government and Electoral Reform is getting married on Friday.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe KBC Bank representatives have agreed to a meeting with three Independent TDs after the Deputies occupied a branch of the bank in Dublin. TDs Mattie McGrath, Michael Collins and Carol Nolan said they took the action on Wednesday to highlight what they claimed was the bank’s “distressing” lack of engagement with customers in arrears who are having trouble making repayments.Jerry Beades and members of the Land League also attended the sit-in protest at the KBC branch on Baggot Street. Mr McGrath said the protest was to highlight “the appalling treatment that customers in distress are receiving at the hands of KBC Bank.He added: “We are concerned about giving out the names of the KBC management we wish to meet as we don’t want them to be antagonised on social media. We don’t want them to be hassled or intimidated.” Mr McGrath said the group began their occupation at 2pm and it ended about 9pm, when they received written confirmation of the meeting. “We ordered fish and chips from Brookwood restaurant next door but they weren’t allowed to come in. I told the staff in the bank here that I am diabetic so they gave us mince pies and Animal Bars,” he said. Meanwhile, gardaí investigating an attack on security men who evicted the McGann family from their Co Roscommon home on behalf of KBC have arrested two men and seized a gun.In the early hours of Sunday, a group of up to 20 men arrived at the vacated McGann property in Falsk, near Strokestown, in a cattle truck, blocking an access road behind them. The group was armed with baseball bats and beat the eight security workers guarding the property. Four vans and two cars were set on fire and a dog was killed during the incident.Mr McGrath said the TDs at the sit-in do not condone the violence that occurred in Co Roscommon. “We’re not here to say people shouldn’t pay or break the law. We want proper conflict resolution and mediation processes to be established for cases like Roscommon. There’s no place in Ireland for modern-day mercenaries from another state coming in here and dragging people out of their houses by the ear,” he said.

Minister for Transport Shane Ross was adamant that no payments should be made at all to the investors.The Government has announcedthat junior bondholders in Anglo would be paid in full from the proceeds of the bank’s liquidation, including investors who had bought the bonds at deeply discounted prices.The former Anglo Irish Bank, which was merged with Irish Nationwide Building Society and renamed the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, was liquidated in 2013. Taxpayers committed €34.7 billion in total, with the prospect of little if any recovery.Back in 2014, then taoiseach Enda Kenny said he did “not see any circumstances - any circumstances - in which junior bondholders would be paid in the liquidation of IBRC.”His comments were echoed by Mr Varadkar, Mr Harris and Mr Donohoe, who said that the junior bondholders were “so low down the pecking order I don’t believe they will be paid.”Mr Varadkar said they would be “at the bottom of the pile”.Mr Ross however, was uncompromising. Demanding that the Government firmly rule out bondholder repayment, Mr Ross told Morning Ireland: “It’s absolutely unacceptable that junior bondholders should be paid at all.”In a Dáil debate in November 2013 Mr Ross said: “I met a large number of fund managers, some of whom were bond holders, and they could not believe it. This was a sucker nation. They expected to be burnt. They expected us not to pay it back and they would not have given a hoot about it. “Instead of listening to the people of Ireland and instead of adhering to what the fund managers expected, we listened to Mr Trichet . . . The capitalist markets understand that this is how things work but for some reason this and the last Government refused even to go to them and eyeball them and say they were not paying this or that they were not paying some of it. “That was the wrong attitude. The markets would have understood and the bondholders would have expected to have been burnt. It was an appalling decision for several reasons. That is why left and right and centre, and market-led people, are united on that today,” Mr Ross said.In the same debate Mr Ross said creditors forgive countries which default very fast. “Creditors forgave Russia and Iceland very fast . . . Iceland and Russia, after defaulting, were back into the money markets very fast.”Asked on Wednesday if Mr Ross now agreed with the decision to repay the Anglo bondholders, a spokeswoman for the Minister for Transport did not comment.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

A lot of us are angry and disappointed,” Françoise Lagarde, a 63-year-old retired teacher in Cannes, told the Daily .Larvae of the weevil crept into France in a consignment of ornamental palms around 12 years ago.The insects, which burrow into the heart of the tree, kill any specimen they reach they reach within months.After chemical treatments failed, scientists turned to a fungus that poisons weevil larvae, and then a predatory worm - but the beetles kept on multiplying.In areas where the weevil has only recently arrived and palms are relatively sparse, such as Normandy and Brittany, there may still be time to counter its spread, the ANSES report said. But pest has resisted all attempts to control it on the southern coast, claimed the agency.  The report itself, he said, highlights the “exceptional result” achieved in the Canaries, which it attributes to “a very rapid reaction, a centralised organisation… and the use of large resources.”Staff trained to detect the slightest symptom of infestation were sent out to inspect trees in the Canaries. If insecticides or insect traps failed to wipe out the pests on a particular tree, it was cut down within 24 hours.For the remaining palm trees in the south of France, ANSES said “the most ambitious realistic goal would be to stabilise the population of red palm weevils and reduce their impact on palm tree mortality by controlling their geographic expansion for as long as possible” - but it warned that the cost would be high.Another alternative, it said, would be to “restrict protection to certain palm trees that are important for their heritage value and propose replacement species for unprotected areas”, prompting outrage along France’s Mediterranean coast.World Cup: Summer of Love, review - One of the best programmes of the yearComment: Hard-line Remainers are becoming ever more extreme as time runs outOxford professor had to hold an academic conference inPrivate schools warn of potential fee rise in the wake of Treasury’s ruling on teacher pensionsInuits blame spate of deaths on \u0026#39cursed\u0026#39 shipwreck of Franklin\u0026#39s doomed expeditionRussian oligarch Oleg Deripaska accused of interfering in Montenegro\u0026#39s electionsScottish workers \u0026#39can take simple steps to avoid higher SNP income tax\u0026#39Comment: The Government\u0026#39s grand post-Brexit immigration plan is likely to see numbers risePolish prime minister warns EU\u0026#39s \u0026#39harsh\u0026#39 attitude to Theresa May could derail BrexitMay and Javid in open conflict over pledge to cut migration below 100,000One in ten child sex abuse websites host \u0026#39adverts for legitimate brands\u0026#39, Home Secretary toldDisney accused of \u0026#39colonialism and robbery\u0026#39 for trademarking \u0026#39hakuna matata\u0026#39 from The Lion KingPolice stations closed as French officers demand £248m of unpaid overtime in day of protest\u0026#39We never forget and we never give up\u0026#39, Met Chief vows to bring Salisbury poisoners to justiceHusband of British UN diplomat arrested on accusations of domestic violence after diplomatic immunity waivedComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

However, I urge consumers to take extra care when shopping online at this time of year.One dodgy purchase could mean that money you think is being saved, ends up being money lost when items bought don\u0027t meet initial expectations - or materialise at all.Retail and Consumer industryWorld Cup: Summer of Love, review - One of the best programmes of the yearComment: Hard-line Remainers are becoming ever more extreme as time runs outOxford professor had to hold an academic conference inPrivate schools warn of potential fee rise in the wake of Treasury’s ruling on teacher pensionsInuits blame spate of deaths on \u0026#39cursed\u0026#39 shipwreck of Franklin\u0026#39s doomed expeditionRussian oligarch Oleg Deripaska accused of interfering in Montenegro\u0026#39s electionsComment: The Government\u0026#39s grand post-Brexit immigration plan is likely to see numbers riseScottish workers \u0026#39can take simple steps to avoid higher SNP income tax\u0026#39Polish prime minister warns EU\u0026#39s \u0026#39harsh\u0026#39 attitude to Theresa May could derail BrexitMay and Javid in open conflict over pledge to cut migration below 100,000One in ten child sex abuse websites host \u0026#39adverts for legitimate brands\u0026#39, Home Secretary toldDisney accused of \u0026#39colonialism and robbery\u0026#39 for trademarking \u0026#39hakuna matata\u0026#39 from The Lion KingPolice stations closed as French officers demand £248m of unpaid overtime in day of protestInvasive beetle set to wipe out palm trees of French Riviera\u0026#39We never forget and we never give up\u0026#39, Met Chief vows to bring Salisbury poisoners to justiceHusband of British UN diplomat arrested on accusations of domestic violence after diplomatic immunity waivedComment: Did a stupid man say ‘stupid woman’?

It does not yet deliver a long-term solution to Italy’s economic problems. But it allows us to avoid an excessive deficit procedure at this stage,” said the vice-president of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday.Is Italy about to re-open the eurozone crisis with its new budget?But he added that the decision could be overturned and fines could be levied on Rome in January if the government does not deliver on its side of the agreement.The citizens’ income and the rolling back of pension reforms have only been delayed, rather than scrapped as policy goals.The leader of the League and deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, had previously pledged that the government would not change “a comma of the budget” but pressure from the financial markets and the hardline from Brussels seems to have caused them to rethink.“To have avoided the infringement procedure is a victory of common sense for the good of Italian citizens,” he said on Wednesday.\u0026nbsp“The agreement reached today shows unambiguously that the European Commission is not the enemy of the Italian people,” said the economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici.“We are not a machine made up of insensitive bureaucrats, imposing austerity and denying democracy. I hope that today we can move beyond such caricatures. I hope that today we can also put to rest any doubts over Italy’s place in Europe.”Italian 10-year bond yields spiked to 3.7 per cent in October, the highest since 2014, after the Italian government said it would allow its deficit to rise, threatening to push the government in Rome into another fiscal crisis.They have since retreated to 2.7 per cent, as markets reacted\u0026nbspto signals of a likely compromise between the populists and the commission.At the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011, when it looked like the single currency area could break apart, Italian 10-year yields were above 7 per cent.The Italian stock market was up 1.94 per cent on the day on Wednesday lunchtime in response to the deal, with bank stocks 3.6 per cent higher.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It does not yet deliver a long-term solution to Italy’s economic problems. But it allows us to avoid an excessive deficit procedure at this stage,” said the vice-president of the European Commission Valdis Dombrovskis at a news conference in Brussels on Wednesday.Is Italy about to re-open the eurozone crisis with its new budget?But he added that the decision could be overturned and fines could be levied on Rome in January if the government does not deliver on its side of the agreement.The citizens’ income and the rolling back of pension reforms have only been delayed, rather than scrapped as policy goals.The leader of the League and deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, had previously pledged that the government would not change “a comma of the budget” but pressure from the financial markets and the hardline from Brussels seems to have caused them to rethink.“To have avoided the infringement procedure is a victory of common sense for the good of Italian citizens,” he said on Wednesday.\u0026nbsp“The agreement reached today shows unambiguously that the European Commission is not the enemy of the Italian people,” said the economic commissioner Pierre Moscovici.“We are not a machine made up of insensitive bureaucrats, imposing austerity and denying democracy. I hope that today we can move beyond such caricatures. I hope that today we can also put to rest any doubts over Italy’s place in Europe.”Italian 10-year bond yields spiked to 3.7 per cent in October, the highest since 2014, after the Italian government said it would allow its deficit to rise, threatening to push the government in Rome into another fiscal crisis.They have since retreated to 2.7 per cent, as markets reacted\u0026nbspto signals of a likely compromise between the populists and the commission.At the height of the eurozone crisis in 2011, when it looked like the single currency area could break apart, Italian 10-year yields were above 7 per cent.The Italian stock market was up 1.94 per cent on the day on Wednesday lunchtime in response to the deal, with bank stocks 3.6 per cent higher.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

The principle of sanctions is there’s conditionality.”Mr Stephens then asked the secretary of state to confirm that she meant people should take zero-hour contracts or “insecure work”, to which Ms Rudd said: “Well I would say yes, if people are offered work, they should take it.”Labour MP Neil Coyle then intervened, saying: “If it’s prostitution? Because that’s the reality for some of the people directly affected. We’ve had that example here.”Discussing universal credit more broadly, the work and pensions secretary admitted there were problems with the new system,\u0026nbspand that the government “sometimes is not as good as it should be at rolling out hugely ambitious new changes”.Universal credit could be ‘disastrous’ for disabled people, MPs warnShe continued: “It is changing, but we are only at the foothills in some respects, so I’m cautious about saying it’s coping well enough to be absolutely clear about how successful it’s going to be in the next few years.”She also implied there may be further delays to the roll out of the welfare reform, saying: “It’s right to have goals, but I will be on top of making sure problems don’t emerge that we don’t address, and if we need to, slow down.”On the two-child limit, a policy that restricts the payment of tax credits and universal credit to the first two children in a family and is currently being challenged in court, Ms Rudd accepted concerns but claimed she may not be able to make changes to it.“I do support the policy that people need to consider when they’re having a third child their income as people in work do, but I do share your concerns about the retrospective element,” she said.“It’s not straightforward because it has already been legislated for, but\u0026nbspI accept the concerns.”The roll out of universal credit has come under intense criticism in recent months, with warnings that it could be “disastrous” for disabled people, places domestic abuse victims at heightened risk and can harm people’s mental health, among other concerns.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK would then stay in the EU and there would be no change to its current relationship.When is the last date Article 50 can be revoked?\u0026nbspMajor calls for Article 50 to be revoked ‘with immediate effect’The ECJ ruled that revocation can happen within the two year negotiating period, or any extension to it. So the current last possible date is 29 March 2019, when Britain is set to leave – but it could be extended further if the 27 other EU countries unanimously decide to grant an extension.\u0026nbspAdditionally, if a withdrawal agreement somehow comes in earlier, then revocation would not be possible from that point – though this appears unlikely for the UK given the current course of events.Does it need approval by the EU?No approval from any EU institution or member state is needed – the ability to revoke Article 50 is the departing member state’s alone.\u0026nbspIronically, given some of the arguments at the referendum, the ECJ ruled this is because under EU law the withdrawal process “reflects a sovereign decision to retain its status as a member state of the European Union, a status which is neither suspended nor altered by that notification”.Who can ask for revocation: the parliament, the government, the prime minister?\u0026nbspThe ECJ says the decision to withdraw the notification has to be made in line with the country’s “own national constitutional requirements” – whatever they may be.Details of post-Brexit immigration policy under wraps until 2020Given the UK Supreme Court ruled that Article 50 could only be triggered with a vote of parliament, it is quite likely that it would need to be revoked by a vote of parliament. The court’s advocate general said in his recommendation that it was “logical that the revocation of that notification also requires parliamentary approval” given it was required to trigger the process.\u0026nbspThe government’s lawyers appear to have conceded this point: in their submission to the ECJ during the course of this case they said parliament must have “directed the government” to withdraw Article 50.However, neither of these strong indications actually make it law. Given what’s riding on the question and the ambiguity of the UK constitution, there is likely to be a legal challenge no matter what happens. Only then will we be absolutely certain. But it’s probably a parliamentary vote.\u0026nbspAre there any constraints, and does a reason have to be given?No reason has to be given. The advocate general’s opinion prior to the judgment said member states could not use Article 50 notification and revocation as an “abusive practice” – and they have to be acting in good faith. There was no mention of this in the final ruling, but the court did say the withdrawal had to be based on an “unequivocal and unconditional decision”.\u0026nbspCan this be used to temporarily postpone or suspend withdrawal?No, or at least not officially. The text of Article 50 spells out a formal process for extending the Article 50 negotiating period, and that requires a unanimous vote of the European Council. As mentioned above, the revocation has to be an “unequivocal and unconditional decision”.However, once the UK has revoked Article 50, there would be nothing stopping it from deciding to leave again. So this would be quite difficult to police, and in practice it could potentially be used to reset the two year negotiating period. This would probably make other\u0026nbspEU member states, and officials, extremely angry however.Would anything else have to be done to stop Britain leaving the EU?As far as EU law is concerned, no. But there is also the matter of UK statute law, which enshrines the exit date in domestic legislation. The status of this is a matter of debate – though given a Commons majority would be required to revoke Article 50, further votes would probably be a formality.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels.“If you look at the current level of migration, the latest stats show 273,000. Most people agree that is very high, certainly by historical standards. In the last two decades it has been in the hundreds of thousands. If you go back further than that, it was much lower.There is no specific target. It will be a system that will bring net migration down to more sustainable levels“What we want to do is bring it to a level where it is sustainable in the sense that it meets first our economic need and at the same time it is not too high, a burden on our communities or on our infrastructure.”Mr Javid has also been reticent to repeat the target in previous interviews and had signalled an intent in the Commons to move away from the “hostile environment” policies Ms May promoted while doing his job.Ms May has strongly resisted pressure to abandon the target from senior ministers over many years, including from George Osborne when he was chancellor.But as news of the target’s absence from the white paper spread, Ms May was asked by Labour MP Chris Elmore whether it was still the government’s intention to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands, and replied that it was.Created with Sketch.Brexit betrayal march in London Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester carrying a noose at the Brexit betrayal march.

This would prohibit lower-paid staff liked NHS nurses coming from the EU to work in the UK.“We are not setting the exact threshold today,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding: “We will consult further on whether its £30,000 or thereabouts.”The Home Office would “go away and listen to what businesses have to say” – after heavy criticism from business leaders about the likely economic damage.Mr Javid also confirmed the document left out the discredited pledge to bring down net migration to “tens of thousands”, saying: “There is no specific target.”Important story this morning, which is likely to dismay Tory bosses, who consider themselves the party of business.\u0026nbspUK businesses are “watching in horror” as bickering politicians bring the country ever closer to no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Britain’s five major industry groups have warned.\u0026nbspRead the full story here:Scotland\u0027s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: If the UK government\u0027s immigration paper is as expected it will be devastating for the Scottish economy - our demographics make it essential that we attract people to live and work here.Amber Rudd, the new work and pensions secretary, is making her debut at the Commons\u0026nbspcommittee this morning.Our social affairs correspondent May Bulman is watching the hearing\u0026nbspand she has flagged up that Ms Rudd hinted there could be further delays to universal credit.Ms Rudd told MPs: “I am enthusiastic about universal credit – I do think we can get it right. I acknowledge it’s not just tinkering – there have been problems, and I see that as the biggest challenge I’ve got.I would much rather every inidual gets the personal attention and care than sticking to a prescribed timetable.Ms Rudd also\u0026nbspadmitted PIP decision-making isn\u0027t good enough, saying: I think we could do better in terms of the waiting time for assessment.And I do have concerns about the number of appeals that get through – ie a lot, and that indicates that maybe those earlier decisions could be better made. I very much take your point that it’s a lot to put people through and we need to get a higher rate of success.Later on, Ms Rudd cast\u0026nbspdoubt over UC: “It is changing, but we are only at the foothills in some respects, so I’m cautious about saying it’s coping well enough to be absolutely clear about how successful it’s going to be in the next few years.Here\u0027s a clip from Sajid Javid\u0027s interview this morning on the Today programme, with the key details on the immigration plans.\u0026nbspThe European Commission has started implementing its no deal Contingency\u0026nbspAction Plan, covering 14 areas where UK withdrawal without a deal would create\u0026nbspmajor disruption for citizens and businesses in the remaining 27 EU states,\u0026nbspincluding financial services, air transport and customs.​The\u0026nbspEU\u0026nbsphas unveiled a raft of measures to protect its “vital interests” in the event of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, writes our Europe correspondent Jon Stone.The European Commission on Wednesday recommended 14 measures in a number of area including financial services, air transport, customs and climate policy.More here:PMQs has now started,\u0026nbspwhich is the last of the year.\u0026nbspTheresa May begins by paying tribute to those killed in the Lockerbie bombing and by sending Christmas wishes to the armed forced and the emergency services.\u0026nbspLabour MP Mike Amesbury\u0026nbspasks whether she is going to act on leasehold mis-selling or if she has \u0027kicked it into the long grass like the meaningful vote\u0027.\u0026nbspMay says that is not true and the government will introduce legislation when parliamentary time allows.Tory Alberto Costa asks can she confirm that she will get a legally binding agreement on citizens rights before exit day?\u0026nbspMay says the Brexit deal guarantees those rights. EU citizens will still be able to access \u0027broadly\u0027 the same rights in a no-deal scenario, she says. The EU needs to be clear too.Jeremy Corbyn joins her in her tributes to the victims of Lockerbie and to the emergency services.\u0026nbspHe wishes Theresa May a Merry Christmas but says she has plunged this country into a national crisis. She has failed to win assurances on her Brexit deal and is now running down the clock before exit day.\u0026nbspHe asks when the European Council will meet to approve changes they have already ruled out?\u0026nbspMay says there are ongoing conversations with the EU. She has already set out the date for the meaningful vote - after\u0026nbspJanuary 14.\u0026nbspShe says Corbyn always sets out what he is against but never says what he is for. He kicks off about a meaningful vote - but all he has a meaningful position.Jeremy Corbyn says she is still unclear about when it will take place. The EU has no council meetings planned in that time.\u0026nbspMay says she will set out the details of her conversations in the New Year. She says he may be angry but it doesn\u0027t hide the fact that he doesn\u0027t have a Brexit plan. He has to accept his responsibility for planning for Brexit.\u0026nbspCorbyn says it is the PM who is supposed to be doing the negotiations. If she doesn\u0027t like it then she should step aside and let someone else do it.\u0026nbsp\u0027The reality is the PM is stalling for time\u0027, he says. It isn\u0027t stoical, its cynical. Can the PM give a cast-iron guarantee that the vote will not be delayed again?\u0026nbspMay says she has been clear when that will be brought back to this house. The majority of MPs stood on a mandate to deliver on Brexit. Corbyn has a duty to deliver on it \u0027but he\u0027s just bottled it\u0027.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted on Tuesday that “there is no such thing as a ‘managed no-deal’”.The business groups’ statement, released overnight, came as ministers stepped up their £2bn contingency plans for a no-deal scenario including placing 3,500 military personnel on standby to support the government.After Ms May was forced to delay the meaningful vote on her withdrawal agreement until mid-January her cabinet agreed on Tuesday that no-deal planning should proceed\u0026nbsp”in full”.

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And we expect Lebanon to take action to protest against this, and not to give into this.”Inside the Hezbollah tunnel that Israel never foundThe Israeli army said it had\u0026nbspso far discovered four tunnels running from\u0026nbspLebanon into Israel, and\u0026nbsphas begun destroying those on its side of the border.On Wednesday, at the site of the first tunnel discovered, in the border town of Metula,\u0026nbspa senior army official said the operation had no time limit and they believed there were several more passageways which would soon be unearthed.This has set Hezbollah back several years, the\u0026nbspimpact on them is big, said the\u0026nbspcommander,\u0026nbspin front of soldiers who were busy at work\u0026nbspdrilling dozens of holes and using radar to look for further passages.This operation does not have a time limit.\u0026nbspWe are going to find each and every tunnel which is a risk to civilians in the northern area, he added.\u0026nbspThe UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it had inspected the sites and confirmed that two of the tunnels cross the Blue Line, the demarcation\u0026nbspthat separates the two countries.It said the tunnels were\u0026nbsp“a matter of serious concern” and constituted a breach of the UN resolution that ended the 2006 war.Metula on the Israel-Lebanon border (Bel Trew)In his most forceful statement yet on the matter, Mr Netanyahu said: “We are holding Lebanon accountable.” \u0026nbspHe continued: “We think the international community should hold Iran, Hezbollah and Lebanon accountable and should act accordingly. Because what you are seeing is not merely a grave violation of our security but a grave\u0026nbspviolation of any nation’s security.”He added that Hezbollah was\u0026nbspusing\u0026nbsp“every third house” in villages in southern Lebanon for\u0026nbsp“aggressive purposes”. He urged the UN security council to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation in its entirety and press for heightened sanctions.At the Israeli border with Lebanon,\u0026nbspLt. Col, Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israeli army, echoed Mr Netanyahu’s words that the Lebanese authorities had effectively colluded with Hezbollah, which he said also had an influence on UNIFIL.Trew)If there is anything “sensitive” in the area, Hezbollah is able to block further investigations, he claimed.\u0026nbspThe administration of US president Donald Trump has taken a tough\u0026nbspstance against Hezbollah and its main backer, Iran. But it continues to provide support to the Lebanese army, which it sees as a bulwark against Hezbollah’s domination of the country. The US has provided some $1.7bn of aid and equipment to the Lebanese military since 2007.Trew)Lebanon has long complained of almost daily flights over the country by Israeli jets. It\u0026nbspsays this is also a breach of the UN resolution. The Lebanese president, Michel Aoun, said last week that he “took this issue seriously”.He said: “We also do not have aggressive intentions. We are ready to remove the causes of the dispute, but after we obtain a final report and we set out the matters that need to be dealt with.”Mr Netanyahu\u0026nbspdismissed the concerns, saying there was a very big difference between Israel\u0027s actions and the threat from the border tunnels.He later addressed reports that the US would withdraw its troops from\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspafter President Trump said that Isis had been defeated there.Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu\u0026nbspsaid he would study Washington\u0027s decision and its implications for Israel, which is concerned about both Iranian and Hezbollah presence in war-ravaged Syria.In any case, we will make sure to maintain Israel\u0027s security and protect ourselves from this arena, the premier added.\u0026nbspSpokesman Lt. Col.\u0026nbspConricus\u0026nbspsaid that security concerns across Israel\u0027s northern front were behind the decision to launch the tunnel operation this month, and had also deterred the army from launching a\u0026nbspfull-scale\u0026nbspoperation to\u0026nbspthe south in Gaza. \u0026nbspAt the site of the Hezbollah tunnels, Israeli army officials said their operation began four years\u0026nbspago,\u0026nbspwhen Hezbollah leader\u0026nbspSayyed\u0026nbspHassan\u0026nbspNasrallah\u0026nbspvowed to invade the Galilee and they started noticing unusual behaviour in areas near the border.\u0026nbspCommanders said the tunnel at\u0026nbspMetula\u0026nbspstretched 40 metres into Israel and originated in a nearby cement factory in the Lebanese town of\u0026nbspKafr\u0026nbspKela, which had ceased operations\u0026nbspin 2014.\u0026nbspIsrael has threatened to take military action against Hezbollah several times since the last devastating round of conflict in 2006. That battle was sparked by a cross-border raid by Hezbollah to kidnap two Israeli soldiers. The group hoped to use them as bargaining chips in order to pressure Israel to release Lebanese prisoners.Metula on the border between Israel and Lebanon where Israeli forces are working to unearth more passageways (Bel Trew)Instead, the Israelis responded with an\u0026nbspattack that led to the deaths of more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians. Forty-four Israeli civilians were also killed by Hezbollah rockets. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHezbollah was founded in the early 1980s with the support of Iran, and spent much of its early existence fighting Israeli troops\u0026nbspoccupying southern Lebanon.Israel invaded Lebanon several times during the country’s 1975-1990 civil war, and occupied much of the south of the country for 22 years.During the occupation, Hezbollah dug extensive tunnel networks across the south of the country. It used\u0026nbspthem to launch ambushes and move around without being\u0026nbspseen by Israeli jets.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

As other leaders said, she was very ­specic about the legally binding text she needed to convince the DUP and her backbenchers to approve the deal.The two-day meeting was actually scuppered by an agreement suddenly being trashed by Ireland and France.Do they have any inkling how much goodwill between our nations they have destroyed with their parlour games over the past ½ years  How many once pro-EU Brits they convert into Leavers with every new salvo Do they not grasp how mistrustful, obstructive and even hostile we would become as an EU member , God forbid, Remain won a second referendum Senior Cabinet ministers including Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt are rightly imploring Mrs May to focus every effort on No Deal preparations. A “managed No Deal” to soften the impact after March  looks a decent idea to us.The Sun always wanted a deal. It’s not going to happen. The EU has other ideas.And a second referendum, or “Norway Plus”, both amount to craven surrenders to this bloated organisation which ­apparently ­relishes belittling Britain. We must get out.TONY Blair is a delusional egomaniac who has damaged Britain more than any politician we can recall.It was his negligence and naivety over dodgy intelligence that condemned  of our troops and countless Iraqis to their deaths during the  invasion.It was his decision to unleash a vast, uncontrolled influx of migrants on a country ill-equipped for it . . . all, as his adviser later admitted, to “rub the Right’s nose in ersity”.It was his lust for wealth after leaving office that saw him torch what was left of his reputation and line his pockets with dictators’ millions.Now Blair is hell-bent on setting a match to our democracy itself as he heads the campaign to reverse the biggest mandate in its history, sabotaging our Brexit negotiating position in the process.And so the trail of destruction he has left for  years goes on. The common thread being his unassailable conviction, despite every single catastrophic mistake, that Tony always knows best.Many of us stopped listening long ago.

That would not have changedshe lost and the Tories picked a new leader.And whatever Jeremy Corbyn says, it wouldn’t changethere was an election and he moved into Number  either.You can’t rule anything out for certain, but most MPs reckon an election is the most unlikely outcome of all.That’s why calling a vote of confidence in the government is a waste of time. Tory MPs won’t risk it and the Ulster Unionists know they will never be more powerful.Anyway, Jeremy told Labour MPs to trigger Article  and set the clock ticking down to departure in March. There isn’t time for an election, the public expect MPs to sort it out and there’s no guarantee it would solve the problem.I asked Jeremy this week what his policy would bethere was an election: would he campaign to stay in, promise another referendum or, after campaigning against the EU for decades, uphold the referendum - but he refused to give any answer at all.And who can be certain he’d win  He should be miles ahead in the polls, but when asked who would make the best Prime Minister, the public still back Theresa May. In fact, in a two-horse race, he comes a distant third behind don’t know.Jeremy seems to think he could negotiate to stay in the single market and customs union, but stop paying our contributions and still have a say over the rules. Who thinks we could get all the benefits without paying a penny Imagine asking to use a gym but refusing to join or even pay – and wanting a say in how it’s run!Let’s face facts: the EU isn’t waiting to give a dferent Prime Minister a better deal. Whether it’s Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, they won’t roll over and give us everything we want.It’s not only Theresa May who says it. Nor even just Juncker. Merkel says the deal can’t be changed.Macron and Ireland’s Taoiseach say so too. Not one EU leader said they are open to renegotiating it.In , % of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. Labour heartlands like Sunderland, Hartlepool, Bolsover, Wakefield or Doncaster all voted leave. Here in the West Midlands, people voted to leave in some of the highest numbers of all.In , our manesto promised to uphold the referendum – no s, no buts, no second referendum.Ordinary, decent people who voted leave believed us. Lots of people voted leave to make politicians sit up and listen.With trust in politics at an all-time low, we can’t discount that lightly. Another referendum would take months and there’s no agreement on what the questions would be.I’ve listened to lots of people in Dudley and there’s not much evidence people have changed their minds. Eventhey had, who thinks a narrow remain vote would settle it That’s why I think our choice is between Theresa May’s deal or leaving with no deal at all. I joined the Labour Party to fight for ordinary people and their jobs must come first.This week I met Jaguar Land Rover, a world-beating British company employing , British workers.Like manufacturers up and down the country they believe a no deal Brexit would threaten their business and the jobs of people who depend on it.Delays at ports will cost jobs. Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Getting rid of it is going to take some work.But the predictions of apocalyptic job losses  Instant recession  We’ve heard the doomsday predictions before.Wrong then, wrong now.There is one thing we are sure of, though, never more so than this week.If we believe in ourselves we have nothing to fear.TOO many of our brave Armed Forces find themselves in tough times when they get back to Civvy Street.So the NHS is dead right to prioritise their care — especially their mental health.Veterans have put their lives on the line for us and it’s only right that we put everything we’ve got into giving back to them.Ensuring they are in good shape, in body and brain, will help our brave boys and girls find jobs, homes and families.It will go a long way to fixing the national disgrace of homeless ex-soldiers.They are the best of us.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a Remainer ruse. Except it’s worse than remaining. Norway Plus, aka “Remain Minus”, would destroy the Tories as surely as simply scrapping Brexit.It is far more likely to do so than any number of “no-confidence” stunts like the one Jeremy Corbyn has now pulled in his pathetic desperation for relevance.If Theresa May’s withdrawal deal fails — and Remainer Cabinet ministers would rather sacrice Brexit than swallow a No Deal — they’ll just have to quit.It’s not much of a threat. We doubt voters will miss them.SO much for the “clf-edge No Deal apocalypse” of hysterical Remainer fantasy.

They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Often these buildings are heritage.“Its full of adrenaline and adventure, every trip is another adventure and you never know what will happen and where you will end up.“Its some kind of off the beaten path tourism.”Placing at number ten, was Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia, USA, a former prison where medical experiments were claimed to have been conducted on detainees between  – .For number nine, Bob selected the many abandoned castles he had visited, particularly those hidden away from vandals deep in the woods or out of sight.Battleship Island, in Japan, claimed number eight, which was bought by Mitsubishi to extract coal from the sea and an articial city arose.In seventh, was Glück Kingdom, an amusement park based on German designs and buildings, including tributes to Brothers Grimm and their chilling fairy tales.In sixth place, was Nara Dreamland an impressive Disney-inspired amusement park in Japan.Claiming fth position, was a discarded army ing boat off the coast of Portugal, the secret location left them battling with security.Bob considers ship The Colbert to be number four, which has remained in a French port.It was destined to be scrapped until the s when it was converted into a museum, since closing  years ago, new plans are in place to demolish it.In third place was an abandoned oil rig off the Scottish coast of Cromarty Firth, which he and other explorers visited for a weekend.In second place was Fukushima, for its haunting remains of areas where residents according to Bob went “head over heels”.He believes the site is just about bad as it was seven years ago after the nuclear power plant accident.But topping all others for the urban explorer was an abandoned military base that contained space shuttles.Bob spent three days in the dessert in order to reach the location, which he admits was by far the hardest of his adventures, yet the most rewarding.Bob became fascinated with old, history-rich locations that had been forgotten during his teen years.Eventually he would go onto start the YouTube series, Exploring the Unbeaten Path, to document his travels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457274480.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow emergency debate watch football","story":"The Commons figure – famed for his yell of “Order!

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

Amber Rudd used the phrase to describe the decision not to pay the pound one-off sum to new claimants of six-in-one benefit Universal Credit. Existing claimants who already receive the bonus will continue to get it, she said, but new claimants under UC will not. The new Work and Pensions Secretary told a committee of Parliament: Its being phased out, as Mr Chairman said, in a way.But it hasnt just suddenly been.. I understand there was the same campaign last year when it wasnt paid either to people who had been moved onto Universal Credit. It came as she was questioned by the Commons Work and Pensions Committee about the lack of Christmas bonus in Universal Credit.   She said: The pound Christmas bonus was paid to a certain group of people who were receiving benefits. It wasnt paid and it never was paid to everybody who would be eligible for Universal Credit. The people who did receive it before are still receiving it. It just hasnt been extended to everybody in receipt of Universal Credit. People are counted as a new claimant to Universal Creditthey have a change of circumstances. That, and people moving into work, means the number of existing claimants is expected to fall over time. The one-off Christmas bonus has been set at pound and unchanged since . SNP MP Chris Stephens said: A benefit thats stayed at the same rate since  as the Christmas bonus has - would the department not look at looking at the actual rate of payment for that   Because Christmas is a time when people are struggling. Ms Rudd replied: In a few years time % of people who are on Universal Credit will be in work so its not just people who arent in work who receive Universal Credit. At the moment new applicants to Universal Credit dont get it... The majority of people who did get it do still get it. The one-off payment was introduced to help those receiving benefits with the extra costs of the festive season and is usually paid to certain people in the first week of December. Those who receive  dferent types of benefits, includingPersonal Independence Payments, Disability Living Allowance, or those on a state pension, get the pound payment. A DWP spokeswoman said on the issue last week: “Universal Credit claimants have never received a one-off December payment but many disabled people on Universal Credit will be better off on average by pound month than when they received ESA.” "},{"url":null,"title":"government quietly edits no deal","story":"NewsGovernment quietly edits no-deal Brexit preparation documents to remove the word unlikelyThe Government has removed the phrase \"in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit from dozens of technical noticesShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  DEC NewsBrexit Secretary Stephen Barclay \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Government has quietly deleted the word unlikely from dozens of no-deal Brexit preparation documents.

Police found a terrying cache of explosives and weapons when they raided Matthew Glynns home in Horfield, Bristol. The -year-old had a viable improvised explosive device- containing ball bearings and nails - under his bed, plus Samurai swords and hundreds of knives and axes. Army bomb disposalofficers closed off his street for two nights while they searched his home, where they found more than kg of explosive powders and chemicals used for bomb making. Glynn, who had demonstrated racist and homophobic views, also bought a Wolverine-style weapon with four sharp blades, described as horric by police.   Details of the hate board emerged as Glynn was jailed for five years on Wednesday. In a sentencing hearing at Bristol Crown Court, Ramin Pakrooh, defending, said his client had a collection of celebrity faces on a dartboard, who he supposedly hated. It also had images of a Somalian boy and an old white man. Bristol Crown Court heard a colleague tipped off police after visiting Glynn at his home in July.  Rachel Drake, prosecuting, said: He went straight to the defendants bedroom and saw a vast array of weapons. He also saw a dartboard with pictures of Muslim people upon it and Mr Glynn said he had a dart board of people I hate. Mr Glynn gave a tour of his weapons, describing their origin and use. The following day at work, Mr Glynn joked that he had had him sat on a bomb when he had been sat on the bed. The colleague, James Grogan, did not believe Glynn at first but later reported the claim to police. Mr Grogan described Glynn as being an anxious man who demonstrated racist and homophobic views. Officers attended at Howdens Joinery, where Glynn worked, on July  and he insisted it had been a joke. Ms Drake said when police asked to search Glynns home and he agreed, as long as he could clean his house first.  He then said he was worried about numerous swords, and askedhe did have something would it be classed as a terror incident . He then admitted making explosives. Glynns bed was X-rayed and a bomb, containing explosives, ball bearings and nails, was discovered. Ms Drake said experts concluded the device would have posed a threat to leit had been detonated.  The police search found a vast array of chemicals, including over kg of home-made explosive powder, a device covered with ball bearings and a tennis ball filled with explosive powder, which could have been used as a grenade. They also unearthed a substantial collection of blades, books on explosives, fuses, ball-bearings and gas canisters, the court heard. Ms Drake said: It was an extremely large arsenal. In interview, he said it was his intention at some point to go to an open space to ignite them to see what damage they could do.  Glynns Facebook pages demonstrated anti-Islamic and racial hatred, said Ms Drake, including rants about banning school trips to mosques calls for the death penalty for terrorists. She said he did not have an explanation for the dartboard of people he hated found at his home and denied he still held views expressed on Facebook. The Facebook pages demonstrate an element of Islamophobia and general racial hated, Ms Drake told the court. One posts suggested school trips to mosques should be banned, while another called for the death penalty for serial killers, paedophiles and terrorists.   Mr Pakrooh, representing Glynn, questioned why his clients Facebook postings had been raised in court. Theres a number of views expressed within his Facebook page such as views on immigration, Mr Pakrooh said. That is absolutely a matter for him and is absolutely not for this court to censure these views unless these views have resulted in him breaking the law. Mr Pakrooh said Glynn objected to his dartboard being referred to as a Muslim board by prosecutors.  Mr Pakrooh: It was a board for people he hated. I dont think any of the images on that board have escaped having darts thrown at them. Glynn had been collecting weapons for about  years and treated them as a hobby, his barrister said. The court heard Glynn had no previous convictions.   At a hearing in October, Glynn admitted five charges under the Explosive Substances Act  between January ,  and July , . Sentencing Glynn to five years in prison, Judge Peter Blair QC, the Recorder of Bristol, said the defendant had expressed hated of others. He described his Facebook postings as haphazard and irregular. The judge said: The really concerning elements of this case were the two bombs which were seized. One of them had ball bearings and nails in it and the other had ball bearings on it. The judge ordered for the bombs and related material to be destroyed. A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: Matthew Glynn was charged with making an explosive device, possession of a regulated substance and possession of a prohibited weapon. The case failed to meet the evidential test to charge any terrorism offences.

Christina Campbell, , has been told that she must leave her home in Northern Ireland in the New Year. The pair have a young daughter, Olivia Rose, who was born in the US - but the couple say they will not allow her to be separated from her mum. Repeated problems with government paperwork means that the three will be separated indefinitely, Belfast Live reported . New mum Christina will be transported to and abandoned in Spain under current plans. Husband Adam, , originally from, Co Derry, Northern Ireland has spoken out against the bureaucracy. She is from Miami and because we have been repeatedly refused our legal paperwork by ious government offices the Border Force officials say they are going to remove Christina from our home in Northern Ireland andher to Spain because that was Christina’s last point of exit from for entry into the UK.   “We were on a week’s holiday in Majorca, Olivia’s first holiday, and so they have decided she will be ed to Spain and left there. “A flight has been booked for January  but I can tell everyone categorically now, Christina will not be on that flight. “Our solicitors have advised the Border Control authorities that she will not be in the airport and she certainly won’t be on that flight. She will not be separated from our daughter or me. “We are good and decent people. We have done everything the right way. We give to our community every day. Christina was a volunteer here in Northern Ireland when she came to Belfast in  and she helped a company grow and thrive.  And she had her own beauty business before coming to Northern Ireland. “We’re married, we love and support each other but we are being hounded by the authorities over paperwork that we just cannot get sorted and now we have been threatened with having our family blown apart. “I am currently living in East Belfast due to work and studies but as part of Christina’s so called ‘bail conditions’ - that’s what it’s called ‘bail’ - she must reside in Portstewart at my mother’s house. So already even here at home, we have obstacles to being together throughout our weeks which is putting a terrible strain on family le and stability.   “We spent six months in Miami and Olivia was delivered there. Before that I had been in full time work in the community since  only to take the break to be with Olivia Rose and Christina for our daughter’s birth. “The removal threat placed on my we was subsequently put in place as our latest European Economic Area visa had been refused on the basis I hold British and Irish nationality, BUT under the Good Friday agreement and by birthright I am entitled to do so. We were also given no right to appeal.

Christina said: “Adam and I met here in Northern Ireland. Adam proposed to me in the US and we conceived our Olivia in Northern Ireland. We only went back to the States because of healthcare provisions for me and because Olivia’s delivery was a planned Caesarian section, we knew we’d be out there for a while. “When we came back to Northern Ireland where we planned to live, at the time of the application Adam hadn’t been in employment in the UK for six months because he wasn’t in the country. So they rejected our application. “We tried the EEA and because Adam has a dual nationality which is his birthright, we were rejected again. Councillor Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston said: “Kerry and I have known Adam for several years. We watched him meet a woman who was as equally fun and lovely as he is, fall in love and eventually become both a father and a husband. We can’t quite believe that we’re going to watch this same family be ripped apart and separated by land and sea.  “They are both skilled, educated and well rounded iniduals and so we figured as long as they did everything asked of them they would be grand. “We can’t quite believe that it’s came to this, in particular that Border Force is quite literally airdropping Christina in Spain simply because it was her last point of entry in to the UK.

Tfany Wright, , said her sister was a bible-loving young girl until she went off the rails and began dabbling in drink and drugs. Carly Ann Harris, , killed her young daughter and burned her body on a coffee table in her back garden in Tonypandy, South Wales, on June . Tfany, who was the first person Carly called after the killing, explained she once idolised her older sibling. She told the Sun: She was my older sister and I looked up to her. She was fun and we got on well, despite our age dference. [But] She started partying hard when she was  and it never stopped. Booze, cocaine, you name it, she used it - all the time. When she should have been at school, she was out with men in fast cars. Tfany recounted how her young sister stopped attending school at an early age and then began to stay out all night four or five times a week.  Following the birth of Amelia, Carly continued her hard-drinking lestyle much to the dismay of Tfany, who she claims was beyond wild. Tfany says she is still haunted by seeing her beloved nieces charred feet after rushing to the crime scene. She refuses to accept the words of doctors who says Carly Ann was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in the weeks leading up to her daughters killing. Tfany said: I dont for one second believe she was hearing voices or even insane in the truest sense. She certainly never behaved in any way insane before that night. Carly, , was found not guilty by reason of insanity on Monday over the murder of her daughter.  The jury ed a special verdict after hearing that psychiatrists - appearing for both the prosecution and defence - agreed Harris was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. She has been sentenced at Newport Crown Court to a hospital order without limit of time. Speaking outside court, Harris’s mother Jacqui Harris, who was visibly upset, told Wales Online : “It’s bittersweet... I am devastated and beyond words.  During the two-day trial, jurors were told there was no dispute that Harris killed her daughter or about the events leading up to the incident. Amelias teenage brother found her body, wrapped in a sheet, on a table in their garden in Trealaw, South Wales, on June  this year. Harrowing evidence read to the jury suggested she had planned the killing.  On the day of she killed her daughter on June  this year, a friend askedshe and Amelia wanted to visit a play centre the next day. Harris replied: “I can’t come tomorrow. I haven’t got Amelia.” Asked what she meant, the defendant said her daughter would be “in heaven”. That fateful night, her daughter was eating sweets on the sofa. Her mum carried her upstairs and told her: “You’re going to see the angels. See you in heaven.”  Neighbours in Trealaw, Rhondda, reported hearing the childs anguished cries as her mother carried out the horrendous act. She was given a police caution and replied: “Jesus told me to do it. She will be okay. Trust me. I’m not crazy. I promise you I wouldn’t do that to my only girlshe wasn’t ing.” The defendant was taken to Merthyr Tydfil Police Station and said: “I deserve to die. My little girl. The angels said it must be done.” The hearing was before Mr Justice Simon Picken.  He told Harris: A young girl rich in promise met her death at the hands of her mother and in the most horric manner. I am satisfied that you are suffering from a mental health disorder, namely schizophrenia. The intention is that as soon as possible you will be transferred to an appropriate clinic close to home. I am of the opinion...that because of all the circumstances of this cause including the nature of your case, the most suitable method is me making an order under S of the  Act and that is it necessary to protect the public from serious harm.

The couple, who are expecting their first child in the spring, are moving to Frogmore House, which is just up the road from their evening wedding reception venue.

Speaking to People, a close friend: [The move] will be the best thing for all of them. Like Meghan and Kate, Harry and William have totally dferent roles. But the brothers will always come together because they are Dianas sons. Rumours of a royal fallout were further fuelled after an insider claimed Meghan and Harry turned down an invitation to stay at Anmer Hall, Kate and Williams Norfolk home, over the Christmas period. They stayed there last year with Kate, William, George and Charlotte, and apparently the family had a great time.  A royal source told The Sun: Theres not a huge amount of room at Sandringham so its quite surprising. Maybe they just want their own space. Things are civil between the couples but they dont spend much time together. Meghan and Harry will stay with the Queen at Sandringham instead. Today the royal family came together for the Queens annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace. The event, which is attended by about  people, gives her the chance to catch up with relatives who arent travelling to Norfolk for the big day itself.

A terried eyewitness said a very brave bystander stepped in to protect his mother and other patients in The Tredegar Practice. The eyewitness, a mum-of-three, was waiting in the surgery when a man - reportedly wearing army-style camouflage clothing - allegedly burst in waving a kitchen kne at around am today.   She claimed the man lunged at her with a blade which was between  and  inches long before he was distracted by another man shouting.

Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, , of Luton, Bedfordshire, was unanimously acquitted by jurors at the Old Bailey of one allegation of preparing acts of terrorism after a retrial. Mr Chowdhury, who told jurors he only wanted to be killed by police and had no intention to hurt anyone himself, bit his lip, raised his eyebrows and then saluted the jurors after they spent  hours and  minutes considering the verdict. Chowdhury had driven his blue Toyota Prius at a marked police van before officers sprayed him with CS gas when they saw him sat in his car with the deadly weapon. He had set off from his home in Kirkwood Road, Luton, with the sword and a kne sharpener before he swerved in front of the police van at about .pm on  August last year.  Chowdhury said he had been feeling lonely and depressed and only wanted to get himself killed by brandishing the blade to police officers. He said he had so many chances to get out of his car and kill the officers but chose not to. Chowdhury smiled and waved at the Old Bailey jury after they cleared him of preparing to commit an act of terrorism after a retrial. The first jury had failed to reach a verdict in June this year. Jurors in his latest trial were shown a number of drawings found inside his cell at Belmarsh Prison on September . One gruesome image showed a terrorist armed with AK-style re shouting Allahu Akbar as he peppers a police officer standing outside  Downing Street with bullets. He also sketched a picture of a plane flying into one of the Twin Towers in the   attack.  Chowdhury claimed he felt guilty about being a UK citizen since Muslims in Yemen were being killed by British weapons supplied to Saudi Arabia. In a WhatsApp group chat Chowdhury was askedhis profile picture was an Isis flag, and he responded: It is an Isis flag. I support Isis, followed by a laughing emoji. He later told jurors it was all in jest. Chowdhury was born in London in May  and later moved to Luton, working as a self-employed Uber driver. Further social media was revealed showing Chowdhury praising the Westminster Bridge terrorist Khalid Masood and claiming all the non-Muslim victims of the atrocity would go to hell. In a suicide note left on his sisters laptop Chowdhury urged his family to struggle against the enemies of Allah which included the Queen and British soldiers. His sister Sneha Chowdhury, , said her brother was not a trouble-maker, just a practical joker whose interests included cartoons, funny stuff and things like memes. Sneha said she found it odd when he suggested they watch The State, a Channel  documentary about the rise of ISIS. Chowdhury had conducted internet searches for beheadings and Prophet Mohammed crimes and Mohammed sex slaves.   Prosecutor Timothy Cray said Chowdhury planned to die as a martyr, fighting in the name of Allah, in the wake of the terror attacks at Westminster and London Bridge last year. Chowdhury was driving along the south east side of the road nearest the palace when he saw the marked police van coming the other way from St James Park way. As Chowdhury swerved across the road the officers inside initially thought the driver might be drunk or on drugs, the court heard. PC Ian Midgley and PC Gavin Hutt bravely approached Chowdhury and managed to overpower him and retrive the sword PC Hutt said Chowdhury started screaming Allahu Akbar while wielding the sword. Investigators found Chowdhury had searched beheadings in Chechnya, Islamic State beheadings and Jihadi John on the internet. Chowdhury, of Kirkwood Road, Luton, was cleared of preparing to commit an act of terrorism.   He told the court: I felt lonely and depressed. I told my sister I didnt want to live anymore. My intention was only to show the sword to a soldier or the police and so get them to shoot me. If I was going to do any acts of terrorism, I could have got out the car with my sword when Mr Gavin was approaching. I had so many chances. I reject the allegations of terrorism. Chowdhury said he had felt guilty being a citizen of the United Kingdom while Muslims in Yemen were being killed by weapons that the government sold to Saudi Arabia. I came across articles criticising the UK government for selling weapons to Saudi Arabia who were killing these people, he explained. Since I realised we were giving aid to them and at the same time providing the weapons for them to be killed, I thought this was a massive contradiction. I felt depressed and guilty. I felt I was also responsible for the decisions taken by my government while my family were dying. I had to shun these people, and show my disapproval. At the time I did not know not to do it. There was nothing I could do. I just wanted to disassociate myself from my governments decision.

Sarah Williamson had suffered back and shoulder pain for nearly a year but thought it was a sports injury. It was not until she got the fracture on her th birthday that she went to her GP about it. Sarah, who lives with husband Richard and daughter Annecy, six, said: “That hug turned out to be so lucky. It’s good it happened when it did. I heard a crack and my husband heard it, and we both thought, ‘What’s that ’ I put it down to a running injury. “But it got so much worse I couldn’t put my coat on or lt up the kettle.

She said: “A lot of people have the disease for six to  months before they are diagnosed. If it had gone on for months longer, that could have had an impact on my treatment.” She was put into the care of Professor Graham Jackson at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, who was leading a trial for the drug that helped save her. First she had six months of chemo and a stem cell transplant, before joining the trial with lenalidomide.  Results show it can prolong average remission times by over two years in younger patients and over a year in older, less fit patients. It cuts risk of progression or death by over % in both groups. It is not yet available on the NHS as it is still at trial stage. Sarah, now , has been in remission for over two years. She said: “This drug helped me get my le back and I’m enjoying it to the full.” Prof Jackson, of the Northern Institute for Cancer Research at Newcastle University, said: “Our research highlights that lenalidomide should be considered for newly diagnosed patients after stem-cell transplantation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"creepy texts reveal how married","story":"NewsCreepy texts reveal how married teacher, , lured pupil, , into having sexBrittany Zamora, , from Arizona, allegedly had sex with the teenager three times and performed a sex act on him in the classroomShareByElaine McCahillNews Reporter:,  DEC NewsBrittany Zamora is accused of sexual misconduct with a -year-old boy\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNew text messages released by police show how a married teacher, , lured her -year-old male student into sexual assaults.Brittany Zamora, , from Arizona, allegedly had sex with the teenager three times and performed a sex act on him in the classroom and in her car.

They then discovered the inappropriate messages and the boy admitted having sex with Zamora when they confronted him about it, according to police reports. Three female students had also noticed issues between Zamora and the teen and wrote a letter to the principal on February , before the alleged assaults took place. The boys parents say the first sexual encounter took place on February .  Principal Tim Hickey said he only spoke to one of the girls who wrote the letter but told police he realised that was a mistake. The victims family filed court papers in August alleging the school district could have put a stop to the alleged abuse as it took place after the principal first heard about the alleged relationship from other students. The parents confronted Zamora over the phone and she apologised about what happened and said she would resign. According to police reports, when asked why the sex assaults took place, Zamora said: “I ask myself the same question. “I just got really close after I think everything went down and we’re like, ‘How could that happen ’ … We just got close.” She also pleaded with them saying: “I don’t want to say stuff and have me recorded right not and bring this to court and have me go to jail for the rest of my le.

Over on Reddit, a generous swimming teacher offering free lessons for kids shared a shocking barrage of unkind messages from a mum who wasnt happy that the classes werent when she wanted them. The mum messaged the teacher askingher son could join the free lessons as a friend had told her about them, before asking what time she should arrive at the pool. The teacher explained that she was at work so wouldnt be able to immediately respond and wasnt teaching that day, but would let her know when the next lesson is so her son could join.The conversation quickly took an unpleasant turn when the mum said she knows the teacher has flexible timing and demands she reply faster and meet her son at pm that day. Heres how it happened. Its obviously a frustrating situationyouve said to your child theyre going to go swimming and then you realise thats not going to happen. The mum then appears to take out her frustrations on the teacher, and starts to call her names like b**** when she doesnt immediately reply and concede to giving her son a exclusive lesson as she requested.  When she realises that he wasnt going to get a lesson that day, she then demands the teacher shows up the next day instead at her specied time - the teacher explains again that she cant go to the pool every day and doesnt teach anyone exclusively.  After the teacher stops replying, the messages start to become more unpleasant.The mum writes to say she is going to throw [her son] in the pool tomorrow and the teacher is responsible for what happens in a bid to get her attention, before calling her more names.  According to the messages, the mum feels like the teacher should ask for money from the other parents, who she considers more privileged than herself, and then give it to her as she thinks the teacher doesnt need it.The post on Reddit went viral, and has over  comments from people who were shocked by the exchange between the two people.One wrote: Wow, I lost it when she was gonna throw the kid into the pool and then blame youhe drowns. Some were sceptical about whether the thread was genuine or not, as someone wrote: I really really really like to think things like this are fake.

Presenter Sylvie Tellier was interviewing some of the young women in the dressing room for channel TF when it happened. But in the background Miss Aquitaine, Carla Bonesso, appeared topless while another contestant had her breasts barely covered. Ms Tellier, who is the national director of Miss France Organisation, described the incident as a major gaffe.  She said: This should not have happened. This is a big mistake on our part and it has spoiled this show a little. And the unfortunate Miss Bonesso, , added: I was not quite naked, it was an accident. But TF did not manage its cameras well, it was not at all professional. She was asked on social media whether she would be pursuing a complaint against the broadcaster and replied: I do not know.  The topless footage sparked controversy on Twitter where one user pointed out it could have potentially undermined the whole contest. The user said: Normally. it is forbidden for Miss France winners to show their breasts so what happensthe poor girl whose breasts were seen on television is elected the winner Would she be immediately disqualied because of this   And another contributor added: Breasts during Miss France!!! Frankly the camera work behind the scenes is limited. Franck Broqua, the director of the television coverage, said he had wanted a camera behind the scenes to be closer to the candidates as they prepared for the event. It had worked well in rehearsals but the cameraman had moved during the live event giving him a wider camera angle.  Mr Broqua said he believed he had reacted quickly enough but added that he was sorry for the regrettable live incident. TF has removed the topless footage from the online version of the show available on streaming services. Miss Tahiti, Vaimalama Chaves, , was crowned Miss France  in the pageant. Miss Bonesso was not named among the top five contestants.

Star striker Pavol Safranko had three decent chances and one of the gilt-edged iety.All were with his head and, given the Slovakian’s obvious quality, it’s a fair betthe same happens on any other day he’ll get on the scoresheet.On top of that, young Matty Smith also saw an excellent effort miraculously saved by keeper Mark Ridgers, meaning on most occasions this was a game that would have been won.Given their dominance of the ball, however, it’s fair to say United should have created more. That they didn’t might be a hangover from previous boss Csaba Laszlo’s year in charge.Like every manager, Laszlo had his own football philosophy and a big part of it was keeping the ball at all costs.Shortly after taking over, he told his players he’d rather they played the ball all the way back to the halfway line than take a gamble and just send it into the opposition penalty box.While the theory behind that is understandable, it led to his team often passing the opposition to death but too often without creating chances, never mind scoring goals.Particularly in the first half up at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium on Saturday, that problem reared its head again. As the manager touched on in his post-match interview, on a string of occasions when they got the ball into the final third, the chance to get it into the penalty box was passed up in favour of a pass back to a deeper lying team-mate.It might just be that, when in advanced areas, taking a gamble and putting in crosses that give the opposition something to defend would be a more fruitful option."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c19031ab7b2c.jpg ","title":"worst christmas tree in the country to be pulled down before december 25","story":"A Christmas tree labelled the “worst in the country” is set to be pulled down ahead of the big day.The Arbroath Christmas tree had taken pride of place on Kirk Street earlier this month during the light switch-on.But images uploaded to social media over the weekend showed the giant fir tree looking a little worse for wear just days before Christmas.Storm Deirdre had knocked the stuffing out of the tree’s branches, leaving it in tatters.The storm swept across Britain leaving a trail of devastation in its wake as ice, snow, freezing rain and gales battered the local area over the weekend.A post on the Arbroath and District Community Council Facebook page said: “We have made the decision to have the tree taken down as the lights have also broken and, without paying £ to have a cherrypicker to take us to the top of the tree where the lights are plugged into the box, we have no way of trying to fix them.“A new tree has been offered, but again it would cost £ to get the cherrypicker to come so we could put the lights on itand we feel this close to Christmas it is too much to try do.”Lewis Jenkins, , owner of Abbey Music on Kirk Street, said the tree had been looking “bonny” before the adverse conditions.He added: “It’s one of these things.

The minister did not seem to realise that many living in my constituency donrsquot feel they have benefited from the city deal and this must change.In his question, Mr Stone said: ldquoA whole shed load of money has been spent in Inverness but precious little has been spent in the out laying areas.

Stevie’s had a big part to play in that.“There’s no doubt Sam’s game is in a good place.“We’ve been searching for that in the top end of the pitch, for those goals to come.”Cosgrove wasn’t alone in netting against McIntyre’s sorry side, with impressive young winger Connor McLennan scoring a volleyed fourth – after he’d set up the opener – and centre-back Andy Considine getting a double of his own from set-plays.Calvin Miller had grabbed a long-range consolation for the team in dark blue before Considine wrapped things up.McInnes added: “ goals in three games now shows you the importance of having the added threat from everyone at the top end of the pitch.“It’s been a good spread of goals.”The manager was delighted at the ruthlessness of Aberdeen’s performance against Dundee, where the visitors, clearly low of confidence, were ferociously pressed and forced into surrendering the ball time and again.He said: “I’m really pleased. From the outset the players’ appetite for the game was clear.“We played with a real edge and intensity.“ Shinnie andFerguson had to do the job in thereagainst three midfielders, but we wanted to carry the threat of May and Cosgrove once we could get to their back four.“Both were very potent in their work carrying that threat for us.“We had good moments in the game. The second goal just before half-time helps us.“We spoke about trying to keep the intensity for the first - minutes of the second half and to go and win the second half.“Getting the next couple of goals allows us to make the changes because of the schedule – it allows us to getMcGinn off, to get May off, Cosgrove off.“The only little blemish was losing the goal. But to score five at home to one of Jim’s teams, who are always well organised and go toe-to-toe with you, I’m really pleased.”Aberdeen have now won four of five league games this month and climbed from the bottom six not so long ago to one point behind Rangers and Kilmarnock, although the Gers play Hibs tonight.They are level on points with Celtic, who play Motherwell tonight and have another game in hand, which means the next two Premiership matches for the Dons – Heartson Saturday and Celtic on Boxing Day, both in the Granite City, could help tip the balance for the rest of the campaign.Of the Reds’ recentto the upper part of the league, where they have finished second behind the Hoops for the past four years, McInnes said: “I’d rather be top, but considering where we were a few weeks ago, we set ourselves a target before the Livingston game to go and win the next four games.“We felt it was important to get to  points after  games.“That’s the halfway stage and normally where we are.

A government that can lead us through the Brexit impasse that currently exists.“We are at risk of leaving the EU without a deal, a position I hope we can all agree would be disastrous, not just for the people of Aberdeen, but the UK as a whole.”Speaking after the meeting, Ms Laing said she had hoped the SNP would back her call for a general election.She added: “Unfortunately the rhetoric that comes with the SNP was fully on show today in that they say in public they want a general election but when they get an opportunity to vote for one they vote against it.”Backing a people’s vote, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn said the council had to defend the % of the city’s population who are EU nationals.He added: “Any Brexit at this stage is likely to damage Aberdeen.“Democracy is to go to the people and ask for their views.”He was backed up by EU citizen and SNP councillor Christian Allard, a Frenchman who said he would not be willing to apply to live in Scotland – where he has made a le for  years.However, Douglas Lumsden, Conservative group leader and co-leader of the council, said councillors should take no action, adding they should be “more concerned by Mastrick and not Maastricht”. Mr Lumsden, who said he voted to remain in the EU referendum, added: “A total of .m people voted to leave the EU. For the sake of democracy it must be delivered and it will be delivered.”He added the motion was “absolutely pointless”, claiming a second referendum would be a “disaster for democracy”.Liberal Democrat group leader Ian Yuill said: “We now know that promises made about Brexit, like £ million a week extra for the NHS and getting a deal with the ‘exact same benefits’ as EU membership, cannot be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens

link","story":"Aberdeen City Council has launched an online consultation on plans for the design of a new cycle link.The local authority is asking for views from residents on the new path, which will be built in Dyce.As part of the authority’s Active Travel Action Plan, the path will form a link between the current cycleway on Wellheads Road and the railway station.It will travel through Farburn Terrace and take in the roundabout to Victoria Street.The current pathway will mean the pavement, on Wellheads Road heading north, will be upgraded to become a three-metre wide shared cycleway.As part of the project, the roundabout on Wellheads Drive, leading to Farnburn Terrace, will also be revamped to include an off-carriageway, three-and-a-half metre pathway.Aberdeen City Council transportation spokesman Councillor Ross Grant said: “This is one of several cycling schemes made public recently by Aberdeen City Council.“I hope people who live or work in the Dyce area will take time out of a short part of their day to look and comment on the designs.“I’d encourage as many people as possible to look at the proposed design and give feedback on it.”Early designs also show plans to institute a mph speed limit on Farburn Terrace due to the limited space on the pavement, which does not currently allow for the creation of a segregated cycle path.The council hopes the building of the new path will improve active travel in the area, particularly to and from the train station, the airport, Victoria Street and the Wellheads Industrial Estate.It is also hoped the path will help people taking public transport to the new TECA site, due to open next summer.Funding was provided by Sustrans and Nestrans for the creation of the designs.Drawings of the proposals are available online and comments can be sent to the council roads department at RoadsProjects@aberdeencity.gov.ukThe consultation closes on January  and all plans can be seen at https:bit.ly GqagjBFollowing the consultation, the council will then finalise the design, acquire the necessary land, and secure the funding for work to be carried out.The move comes as a competition was opened to design a new cycle path on a city road.The Aberdeen Cycle Forum launched the contest this week in the hope designs and ideas would flood in from across the world for a segregated bike path on King Street.Prizes are being given out for the winners of each age category, under , between  and  and over .The winning plans will also be submitted to the council."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/xmas-shows-130x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inspectors praise for north

On the contrary, there’s funding there.

We have the Scottish Government laying down conditions around ring-fencing of certain parts of the budget.“We will have to take all of that into account.”However, Ms Forbes said the budget settlement puts the power in local councils’ hands.She said: “I think for me the important aspect is the local authorities have the freedom to decide on their own spending priorities.“They have to fulfil statutory obligations and there is additional spend on the services which people who live and work and play here in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire will use.”Ms Forbes added the Scottish Government has set its budget in the backdrop of austerity from the Westminster Government, with a cut to the Scottish budget.And Stephen Flynn, city SNP group leader, said: “It’s unsurprising to see the administration have dusted off their annual budget quotes while once again completely ignoring their inability to get Cosla to change the funding formula in place.“Not only that, but they ignore the tens of millions of pounds worth of overspends and delays that have been incurred on their watch.“Folk aren’t daft, they know this administration has a truly woeful record when it comes to meeting budget constraints.“I only wish they spent more time on getting their own house in order.”"},{"url":null,"title":"saving money at what cost","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowShort term thinking in our public agencies is the target for this week#s satirical artwork from Ann Thomas.Using the closure of Tarbert#s tourist information centre as an example, Ann muses over the impact of austerity on society.As the effects of the prolonged financial recession continue to be felt in national and local government, it is the most vulnerable in society who are most at risk as increasingly desperate measures are taken to save huge sums of money."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 44","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Over the past few years the Argyllshire Advertiser has carried a number of stories about tenants of Argyll Community Housing Association complaining about chronic dampness in their homes.There will be the silent majority, of course, who are quite content with their homes, but there does seem to be a problem with a proportion of the housing stock.The association inherited a lot of these issues from Argyll and Bute Council when the housing stock was handed over, and finances are getting no better to address them.But surely, when there is a baby in a house with exposed wiring, skirting boards removed and not de-nailed in the house and obvious damp problems # why can a solution not be found with urgency Tarbert Book Festival offered a treat for book lovers, and the weather helped to make it a hugely enjoyable event for everyone who went along.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered.

Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million. This would be a considerable amount at any time, but coming after years of funding cuts already, it will demand particularly dficult decisions to be made.Councillor Aileen Morton, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, added: #This local government budget is extremely disappointing for the council, our residents and communities. The Scottish Government provides around  per cent of councils’ funding so another . per cent reduction will have signicant impact.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

He told her that he had been drinking at the pub since .pm and she said he was so drunk he was unable to work the remote control for the television.

Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together.

It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Did the best woman win The Apprentice final ","story":"Yet this th series, which ended with an all-women final last night, has seen the show rejuvenated.

After her deal is defeated in mid-January, she will delay and preicate, let the days and hours tick by until a hard Brexit becomes an imminent reality. She will then force Parliament to accept her deal to avoid no deal. From her point of view it makes sense. The reality is that Labour risks colluding with this irresponsible brinksmanship. It has been playing around with presentational ersions to avoid having to make any strategic decision about unblocking Brexit.The Prime Minister batted away Jeremy Corbynrsquos contrived attempt to move a confidence motion in her personally, but not her Government ndash a ldquomotion of no consequence as itrsquos been called. A properly tabled confidence motion, which Labour knows is the only one that would have been put to a vote, would likely have been defeated as Tory MPs united around their beleaguered leader.

The discredited former PM is the only politician who seems to be offering anything remotely resembling leadership right now. He has been perambulating around Europe, much to Mrs Mayrsquos displeasure, urging EU leaders to take seriously the possibility of the repeat referendum he advocates. He brushes aside the argument that this would be a betrayal of democracy. Nonsense, he says: a referendum IS democracy ndash the only democratic solution when Parliament is deadlocked.:SNP and Lib Dems put down no-confidence motion in Theresa Mays GovernmentIn one sense Labour is more united than ever. Both the youth wing, and the activists of Momentum, are ardent Remainers and desperate for another referendum. In this they are joined by the old Blairite Labour Right, led by former shadow cabinet luminaries like Chukka Umunna and Hilary Benn. But the old Labour Left, who by an accident of history happen to occupy the Labour leadership right now, are Eurosceptics in the proper sense of the word. Mr Corbyn says he voted Remain in , but Labourrsquos  manesto made a clear promise to deliver Brexit and end free movement.Labour only really opposes Mrs Mayrsquos version of Brexit because it doesnrsquot protect workplace rights and doesnrsquot guarantee friction-free trade. Mr Corbyn says he wants a General Election so that he can go off and negotiate a version of the Withdrawal Agreement that doesnrsquot have these limitations. But everyone knows this is pure fantasy ndash an insult to the intelligence of the voters. Eventhere were time for a General Election and a renegotiation before March, it would be futile. The Withdrawal Agreement is a legally drafted document, negotiated over two and half long years, and has been endorsed by all  remaining states. Unless the UK is prepared to lt its red lines and stay in the single market with Norway, which Labour isnrsquot prepared to do, then there is nothing more to be said. The Irish backstop would remain because Labour is committed to avoiding a border.The logic of Labourrsquos position should surely be to wrest what concessions it can from Mrs May about workplace protections and the Good Friday Agreement and then back her amended deal. The Withdrawal Agreement is not, after all, the future trade agreement with the European Union. It only sorts the immediate problems of paying the orce bill and guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens, here and in Ireland. The Political Declaration on the future relations with the EU that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement is much more contentious. Itrsquos a vague wish list in which the only definitive red line is on free movement, insisted upon by Mrs May. Labour should surely be using its influence now to ensure that the future trade deal keeps Britain in that ldquopermanent customs union and single market alignment that Mr Corbyn always talks about.Now, many Scots will be appalled at this suggestion that Labour should back Mrs May, and I hasten to add that it is not my own position. I would never have left the European Union in the first place. Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and has been treated abominably in the Brexit process. Scotlandrsquos legitimate interests in securing a Brexit that doesnrsquot damage Scottish economic and civic le have been peremptorily dismissed by Westminster. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos proposals for Scotland to have similar regulatory alignment with the EU, as accepted for Northern Ireland, were batted away without a thought.The UK Governmentrsquos subsequent legal jiggery-pokery has damaged the constitutional standing of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, under which the Scottish Parliament had to consent to Westminster legislation that cuts across its devolved powers, has been exposed as a sham. No backstop there. The Scottish Parliamentrsquos Continuity Bill, which sought to ensure that Holyrood retained its devolved powers as they were repatriated from Brussels, was disposed of by retrospective legislation which would have shamed a banana republic. Scotlandrsquos requests for devolution of responsibilities like immigration have also been ignored.But the unfortunate reality is that Scotland is irrelevant right now.

I must say I was struck by Mr Russells description of members of the Labour for Independence group as a \"bunch of nobodies\", and thought it a very un-Christian remark to make.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.PETER A Russell tells us that he cannot understand how anyone who claims to be a Christian, because Christianity requires common endeavour and mutual support, can also believe in independence. Similarly, have sometimes thought that no-one who votes Tory can possibly be a Christian. Were both wrong of course.My neighbour and I co-operate by, for example, putting out each others bins, but he doesnt control my household budget nor I his.Mr Russell goes on to suggest that for the time being at least Scotland is on the receiving end of a co-operative UK. It depends on your time perspective I suppose but I thinkmeasured over the last  years Scotland would be seen as a net contributor, letrsquos not even mention Scotlands long-erm contribution to the UKs intellectual le and its disproportionate contribution to wars and Empire.Oh, and Im an atheist by the way.John Jamieson, Craigie Road, Ayr.PETER Russell again confirms the branch office mentality of the Labour Party in Scotland ndash a party where a General Election is more important than the looming Brexit. He fails to follow his own logic in that by leaving the UK and rejoining the EU, Scotland would indeed achieve \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\".His argument is undermined by the Labour Partys underwhelming position on Brexit. I do think he is in denial and wish him all the best in reconciling his Christian beliefs.Dr Martin Buchan, Torr Avenue, Quarriers Village, Inverclyde.PETER Russell does not understand how any Christian can reconcile the idea of loving your neighbour and independence. Perhapshe thought a little deeper he might understand that loving your neighbour does not mean accepting domination by him. It means giving him the respect you expect to receive from him in .Cravenly accepting a situation where you are permanently rendered powerless by an inbuilt majority is not Christianity. In fact, it is the very opposite. The concept of subsidiarity is crucial to Christian social teaching. This means power should be surrendered to the lowest level possible.Even more grotesque is the notion of any kind of adherence to the principles taught by Jesus and being complicit in preparing to use the worldrsquos most powerful machine for the mass killing of human beings.Trident is the worst thing in the world. It devastates every moral and legal code. This blasphemy is the price we pay for our devotion to British nationalism. The sooner we escape from this nightmare the better for us, and for our neighbours throughout the world.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present. Unless the Minister agrees to think again ahead of Stage  consideration of this bill, that situation is unlikely to change.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.

Dead as a doornail.Yet of all the good days in the year, on Christmas eve the Prime Minister still sat in her Downing Street office, the door open that she might keep an eye on her clerks.Gavin Barwell and Robbie Gibb sat in the light of a very small fire, barely visible in the shadows cast by piles of draft Withdrawal Agreements, assurances and side-letters, backstops to the backstop, and flowcharts pointing at dferent fates for May.Hands freezing, backs bent, they scratched out desperate plans to force her deal through the Commons. Scurrying over the floorboards in the dark, damp corners, whips searched for votes.May’s phone vibrated and cast a shaft of light into the darkness – a text. “You don’t have to do this, Theresa. I’m just trying to help. Merry Christmas, TB.”“Nothing has changed!” she wheezed, firing back: “Keep Brexit in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.”Leaving her clerks to their work, May climbed the stairs to her apartment to take her melancholy dinner and try and unwind in front of a relaxing episode of ‘Naval Crime Investigation Service ’.No sooner had she nodded off than May was awoken by a clanking, thudding sound on the stairs, growing closer, and louder, relentless and doom-laden, like thecomment section.Through her closed bedroom door a figure appeared, and the blue TV light crackled and leapt as though it cried: “I know him Nick Timothy’s ghost!”The same beardy face, the same name. The chain her former special adviser drew was clasped about his middle and dragged bundles of newspapers.“But Nick,” May whimpered, cowering, “you’re in chains.”“It is required of every man,” Timothy replied, “thatthey are not self-aware in le, then it is condemned to be after death.”The spectre raised a cry and shook its columns. “I wear the chain I made in Downing Street,” it said “I made it line by line, blame by shted blame.“I am here to-night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate,” Timothy went on. “You will be haunted by Three Spirits.”May awoke with a start, but before she could convince herself it was a dream, light flashed and the curtains of her bed were drawn. She found herself before a strange figure, with a face like child, yet not so like a child as like an old man.“David,” she said, recognising her predecessor. “Are you a spirit, too ”“I am the Ghost of Brexit Past,” David Cameron intoned. “Yours, thankfully, not mine.”She took him by the hand and the pair flew into the past, alighting first at a  meeting with Goldman Sachs bankers, where she warned Brexit would deter investment in the UK, then to a speech where she warned of the risks to EU-wide security cooperation.: Jeremy Corbyn to table no confidence motion in PMBrexit vote date not setOn to her first Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, where she said “Citizens of the World” were really “Citizens of Nowhere”, and then back to Downing Street. “Your lip is trembling,” said the Ghost. “And what is that upon your cheek ” For this was where May called an election accusing the EU of undermining Brexit, then lost her majority.May awoke for a second time, and found her bedroom filled from top to bottom with angry men in suits, discussing in the most extravagant and overflowing terms exactly how they were going to dispose of her. “Come in!” exclaimed the weird and not-at-all-jolly giant presiding over the European Research Group. “I am the Ghost of Brexit Present, and we’re going to feed you into a wood chipper.”Issuing bloody threats all the while, the spirit showed May ordinary families ruining their Christmas dinners with arguments about Europe, plotting MPs, fruit crops rotting in polytunnels, and more angry figures in yellow vests shouting about betrayal.“All this is possible thanks to you isn’t it great ” the Ghost said. “Can’t wait to boil you in a pot.”And suddenly, he was gone. Lting up her eyes, May beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming towards her like a mist along the ground that has somehow managed not to be sacked. “Jeremy ” she asked. “But you’re a Remainer!” Jeremy Hunt answered not, but gave a hooded, sepulchral shrug.“Ghost of Brexit that is Yet to Come!” May exclaimed. “I fear you more than any spectre I have seen.” And truly, the sights of no-deal Brexit Britain chilled May to the bone.She was transported back to her Commons office, but behind her desk Prime Minister Tom Tugendhat had his head in his hands. His government of national unity, formed in the wake of splits in the two main parties, was collapsing. Amid a stack of resignation letters were demands from Nicola Sturgeon for a Section  order, and calls from Sinn Fein for a border poll in Northern Ireland.In the streets, protesters gathered round skips filled with burning copies of David Cameron’s memoirs for warmth. There were no negotiations with the EU Brussels was in chaos since the far right surged in European elections. Nor was President Pence in a position to offer a trade deal, what with the legal trouble.The spectre took May to conflicts in Ukraine and Yemen, where the UK had given up any pretence of exerting its influence. And they visited China, which continued to suck up production and jobs as the West dismantled the world trade system it had designed. Actually, they went to Japan first before Hunt worked out his mistake.“Good spirit,” May cried when she had seen these things “Assure me that I may yet change these shadows. I will live in the past, present and future. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach!”She awoke with a start again, and knew things were dferent. Flinging open the window of Number , she made a series of unnatural jerking movements, like a jostled shop mannequin about to topple over.“But darling,” cried her husband Philip, “you’re dancing with joy! And only last night you were so despondent.”Beaming, she turned to him. “I know what I have to do.”: Brexit: There’s only one way out of this screw-up – Christine Jardine©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845913.1545206611!/image/image.jpg","title":"how home office is blocking glasgow s efforts to provide true asylum martyn mclaughlin","story":"The Home Office#s intransigent approach to providing housing for asylum seekers is causing anger and mistrust across the country, writes Martyn McLaughlin.Anyone who has paid attention to the Home Office’s thoughtless and negligent approach to housing asylum seekers over the past decade will not be unduly surprised by the latest damning report from the Home Affairs Select Committee.The most obvious question to draw from its primary conclusion – that local authorities across the UK are experiencing a crisis of trust in a broken system – is quite simple. What took so long Britain’s dispersal policy has been unfit for purpose for years. The Home Office’s existing ‘Compass’ contract places the responsibility for housing some of society’s most vulnerable iniduals with multinational conglomerates, some of whom had no prior experience in the complex asylum housing sector. In Glasgow, where Serco has been widely criticised, there have been numerous examples of the initiative’s folly: families forced to reside in properties ridden with vermin and damp, or which lacked essentials such as window panes and heating. Serco’s plan the change the locks on the properties of asylum seekers earlier this summer sparked widespread protests and a legal challenge. Charities and NGOs forced to pick up the pieces have been some of the fiercest critics of Compass, but the new report, published on Monday, shows that councils are fast catching up. With confidence in the entire process waning, MPs have warned that the entire system could soon become untenable.“Nearly two years after our previous report, very little has improved and mistrust by local authorities of central Government has deepened,” the committee noted. “The Government’s handling of the replacement for Compass has led dispersal authorities to consider withdrawal from participation in the dispersal scheme.”In truth, the use of the word replacement is a tad disingenuous renewal would a far more fitting descriptor, given the UK Government looks set to plough ahead with issuing decade-long Asylum Accommodation and Support Servicescontracts. The acronym may be new, but it is Compass in all but name.: Insight: Asylum seekers at breaking point as trauma takes its toll on mental healthThe dissatisfaction over the dispersal scheme is most keenly felt in Yorkshire, but it is proving contagious. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, recently wrote to Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, detailing his misgivings regarding oversight of the dispersal contract, and underlining the need for a fairer distribution of asylum arrivals across the country. Emphasising the gravity of the problems, Mr Burnham warned him that Manchester’s ten local authorities were now “seriously considering” their continued participation in the scheme. Fortunately, especially for the ,-plus asylum seekers in Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow City Council is not inclined to follow suit. It was one of the first cities in the UK after London to join the dispersal scheme and for nearly  years, it has taken great pride in its participation.The city, in turn, has benefited immeasurably. In the space of a generation, its communities and culture have been enriched and Glasgow’s reputation as a welcoming city has been enhanced. The SNP administration knows this only too well, and it is keen to continue with the dispersal programme,not the precise arrangements put in place by the Home Office. When Glasgow first became part of the initiative, it was the city council itself which was the contract holder. All these years later, and in light of the disastrous Compass contract, the council was minded to take over the reins for AASC. : Brian Wilson: Serco right about one thing in asylum seeker eviction rowAfter making a formal expression of interest, it received a -page form from the Home Office, designed for organisations with direct experience of providing asylum accommodation in the past ten years. It was, said Susan Aitken, the council leader, “almost impossible for us to answer”.Undeterred, she is among other local authority heads pressing for greater oversight of the new AASC arrangements, albeit to little avail. The Home Office has repeatedly warned that ceding control of property inspections to local authorities, for example, would compromise its ability to hold accommodation providers to account. It is a claim as laughable as it is absurd. Such is the Home Office’s commitment to ensuring that asylum housing is fit for purpose, it employs the grand total of nine contract compliance officers, responsible for assessing , dispersal accommodationproperties across the UK. A single officer is based in Glasgow.The workload they are able to carry out has produced some damning conclusions. Between March  and January this year, for example, less than a quarter of those properties inspected were found to be compliant with the requirements of the Compass contract. Close to halfwere deemed not fit for purpose. A separate inspection report carried out earlier this year by David Bolt, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, found that the Home Office inspection regime was essentially a system of spot checks, which were neither informed by intelligence, nor subject to follow-up inspections. The Home Office has shown itself to be unable,not unwilling, to ensure some of Scotland’s most marginalised and vulnerable people are given proper shelter. If it is allowed to steamroll through its plans for AASC with no meaningful changes, we will all be the poorer for it.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845818.1545206166!/image/image.jpg","title":"why birmingham may be a role model for scottish cities chris mccall","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...After three months in Birmingham, Chris McCall says the rebirth of UK#s second largest conurbation could have lessons for Scotland#s cities.Their faces said it all. It was a look of slight surprise crossed with mild concern. I had told them I was moving to Birmingham. Whether it was friends, family or colleagues, they struggled to see the appeal of le in the UK’s second largest city.I would explain I was moving for a three-month work secondment. It was too good an opportunity to turn down. I planned to travel home to Glasgow most weekends. Exploring a new city would be fun.“The only thing I know about Birmingham is there are a lot of motorways,” was a typical response. It had that in common with my home town, I thought. Here was another place that had been determined to bulldoze its way to post-war prosperity. Unlike Scotland’s biggest city, Brum held its nerve and built not one but two ring roads – instead of the half-finished mess inflicted on Charing Cross and Tradeston.But what did I really know about this sprawling metropolis  That the car was king, of course. Millions of them were built there and thousands of properties had been cleared to make way for the roads its new car-owning society demanded. Birmingham was the UK’s Motown – but with a much heavier musical legacy Black Sabbath never wrote cutesy soul songs.“Birmingham’s name is known everywhere,” the broadcaster Jonathan Meades observed two decades ago. “But its people aren’t, and nor is their city which is in the middle of England and is Middle England. It’s hyperbolically typical of England, yet at the same time it’s hermetic – it’s an ignored voice in the heart of the country.”It’s fair to say that downtown Brum is still largely dominated by its roads. Yet it’s gradually moving away from the cult of the automobile towards a more sustainable future which could offer examples for Scotland’s major cities.When I stepped off the train at New Street in September, I was determined I would understand Birmingham by the time I left. I might not grow to love it, I thought, but I would at the very least appreciate what it had to offer.: Alastair Dalton: Failure to curb cars in cities is throttling busesStations can tell us a lot about a place, and the story of New Street tells us more than most. It was once a grand Victorian affair with an Italianate style hotel and a spectacular  canopy designed by Edward Alfred Cowper. It was a terminus that reflected the commercial might of the Midlands.That fine station roof was one of many Brum landmarks to be damaged beyond repair by the Luftwaffe, while the hotel fell victim to British Rail’s west coast mainline modernisation programme of the early s – the same damned project that blighted London’s Euston station. The new New Street was generally despised from the off. Instead of providing a beacon of the future, it condemned passengers to a hideous concrete bunker. A costly refurbishment programme began in . While the s remain subterranean – meaning diesel fumes still linger – the upstairs is now a bold and bright concourse.There’s plenty of space for strangers to find their bearings. “If you think it’s bad now, you should have seen it before,” Brummies say, with characteristic self-deprecation. “Brum will be great when it’s finally finished,” is another line you hear regularly. This is a city with a long record of tearing itself down and trying something dferent.The New Street rebuild is just one of several ambitious local projects. The redeveloped Bullring shopping centre boasts a Selfridges, the high-end department store long coveted by Glasgow. The city’s modern tram network is currently being extended with little of the fuss seen in Edinburgh.: Kevin Buckle: Edinburgh’s lost railway could be restoredHere I was, privileged to be witnessing the rebirth of one of the UK’s major cities in real time. Unlike in Dundee, which has chosen to take the Bilbao route of hanging its international appeal on an eye-catching museum, Birmingham has opted to get the basics right. If you can offer numerous decent shops and a gleaming station, visitors will soon follow.For a city with a long association with the car, it’s investing substantial amounts in public transport. Its suburban rail network has been continuously growing for years. Then there’s the small matter of HS, the eye-wateringly expensive infrastructure project – or colossal folly, depending on your viewpoint – which will link Birmingham with London via a new high-speed rail line.In comparison, it strikes me that Scotland’s two biggest cities seem incapable of sorting out public transport in their own backyards. Edinburgh’s buses are the best outside of London but the capital seems uninterested in reopening its extensive network of suburban railways to passengers. The less said about the tram system, the better.Glasgow, meanwhile, boasts dozens of stations yet is stuck with a bus network that’s grimly tolerated at best. Its own plans for a tram system bit the dust  years ago and have never seriously been reconsidered.Brummies would be the first to tell you their city isn’t perfect. Among other things, it lacks any instantly recognisble landmarks to entice visitors. The council hopes its flash public library, opened in , is becoming one. The -storey building positively screams modern civic ambition.I looked beyond these modern developments whenever I felt the dull ache of home sickness. I was fortunate to stay a short distance from the Birmingham and Worcester canal, one of two major waterways built in the Georgian era. If you enjoy a stroll along a quiet towpath, Birmingham is your place. It’s one of the few parts of the city you’re guaranteed not see any cars.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4839780.1545212584!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford told go back to skye by tory mp","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP leader at Westminster was reportedly told #go back to the Isle of Skye# as he stood to speak at an emergency Commons debate on Brexit.Ian Blackford was in the chamber for the EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate today when the comment was shouted, with several MPs quickly pointing the finger of blame at veteran Conservative member Sir Nicholas Soames.It provoked a furious reaction from senior Nationalists.

The White Paper itself suggests that it may result in an % reduction in the number of EEA workers to Scotland - this will be catastrophic for communities and businesses across the whole of Scotland, particularly for key sectors such as tourism, hospitality and the care sector.\"Our modelling estimates that real GDP in Scotland will be around .% lower by  than it would have been otherwise, as a result of Brexit-driven reduction in migration.“This is equivalent to a fall of almost £. billion a year in GDP by  and a fall of £ billion in Government revenue over the period. This is an unacceptable price for Scotland to pay.”Tracy Black, the director of CBI Scotland, called the policy a “sucker punch” to employers.“A new immigration system must command public confidence and support the economies of all parts of the UK,” Ms Black said. “These proposals would achieve neither.“The proposals outlined in the White Paper don’t meet Scotland’s needs or the needs of the UK as a whole, and would be a sucker punch for many firms right across the country.“The UK Government’s own analysis suggests people and regions will be poorer as a result of them.”The proposals also drew criticism from Kirstene Hair, the Scottish Conservative MP for Angus. “The detailed White Paper outlines a skilled based system that will enable nationalities around the world to come and work in the UK,\" Ms Hair said.\"But I do have concerns regarding the £, salary threshold and low skilled sectors.“Many healthcare, hospitality, agricultural and fisheries jobs do not meet the salary floor or skill level in the proposals outlined which could prevent these vital workers coming to the UK to work and contribute to our economy.\"Scottish Secretary David Mundell defended the new measures, saying they provide \"a strong foundation for delivering what businesses and iniduals in Scotland want – a UK-wide immigration system with the flexibility to meet the needs of all sectors of the economy in all parts of the country.\"Mr Mundell added: \"Our  month engagement with business will allow us to develop a future immigration system which addresses the specic economic and demographic needs in Scotland.\"At the same time, the Scottish Government must do more to shoulder their share of the responsibility for making Scotland an attractive place for people to live, work and put down roots.”A new work visa scheme will allow immigrants to come to the UK to work for up to a year.The new measure, which would be in place until at least , is designed to act as a \"safety valve\" for the economy and protect sectors reliant on lower skilled overseas labour.It would be open to nationals from specied countries, regardless of their skill level or whether they have a definite job offer.Applicants would need to apply for a visa which would be limited to  months, at which point a \"cooling-off\" period will take effect, meaning they could notunder the same route for the next year.While in the UK, they would not be entitled to access public funds or switch to other routes, bring dependant family members or seek permanent settlement.The White Paper states: \"We have listened to the concerns of businesses ... and so there will be a route allowing temporary short-term workers to come for a year.\": EU migration falls to lowest level since The scheme would be open to all skill levels, with no sponsorship requirement.It would be subject to \"tightly defined\" conditions and only open to migrants from \"specied low-risk countries\".Numbers admitted through the route may also be restricted, while the Government stressed it was a \"transitory\" measure and would be subject to a full review by .The new skilled work route would be opened up to workers with \"intermediate\" level skills.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October.

Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##..

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/p1-crop.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8737398.1544617405!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley luxury maldives holiday paid for by mystery friend","story":"The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.Ian Paisley, M.P.The holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of membersrsquo interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.ldquoFor the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you.

He had made arrangements with Antrim Borough Council to have their carriage kitted out with flowers and champagne, only for his plans to be put on ice due to the weather.Not one to hang around, he put together a back-up plan to ask Leanne for her hand in marriage at the Templeton Hotel in Templepatrick.Leanne, , said: “We’re five years together, we’ve one child at four and another on the way. Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it. The big wheel will probably be the story we’ll tell peopleanyone asks how we got engaged.“Our daughter Quinn, four, was with us the second time.

Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

Take some time to yourself, some time to reflect, some time to remember and some time to recharge the batteries for the New Year ahead.“Andpossible take some time for others, I have really enjoyed meeting people during my term of office and sometimes a kind word or deed, or just a chat can lt someone’s day. So this Christmas time, maybe call on people who may be lonely or those in need of comfort.“I also know that for many families, like myself and my husband, Christmas can be a dficult time. “It stirs up lots of memories of good times and bad, of love, and of loss. For those people and families, I have no words of good advice, as I’m still just getting through, but I will say, be kind to yourself, be kind to others, and do what is right for you. “I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and a Peaceful and Prosperous New Year!”* Bins scheduled to be collected on on Boxing Day, Wednesday, December , will be collected on Saturday, December .

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christmas in comfort at clonard","story":"CLONARD parishioners will be able to enjoy their Christmas Mass even more this year as the traditional hard wooden pews have been consigned to the past.

Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chris moncrieff whether youre a leaver or a remainer a second poll would be a betrayal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is true whether you are a Remainer or a Leaver. Parliament ordained the referendum and, at the same time, gave a solemn promise that they’d abide by the result..pushThe fact politicians have got themselves in such a mess trying to implement the referendum result in favour of quitting the EU cannot ever be used as an excuse for defaulting on the original undertaking.To her eternal credit, the Prime Minister refuses to bow to the clamour for a second referendum.She hit out at Tony Blair, accusing him of “insulting” the British people and the office of Prime Minister by “undermining” Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.In a pointed swipe at the Labour heavyweight, the Prime Minister said a second referendum would amount to parliament abdicating responsibility.Mrs May said: “For Tony Blair to go to Brussels and seek to undermine our negotiations by advocating for a second referendum is an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served. We cannot, as he would, abdicate responsibility for this decision.“Parliament has a democratic duty to deliver what the British people voted for. I remain determined to see that happen. I will not let the British people down.”The trouble is that the people who really matter — the great British electorate — are being fobbed off with contradictory stories about what is going on behind the scenes. Some are insisting that the Cabinet is involved in its own civil war about whether to have a second referendum, while others insist this is completely untrue.Meanwhile, those calling for another poll are claiming that those who voted for the UK to leave the EU did not appreciate what this would involve.How patronising. Of course, most people realised that the EU negotiating team would try to squeeze every drop of blood out of the UK in what has approached the level of bullying the Prime Minister partly, no doubt, to frighten any other member states which might be considering following in the UK’s footsteps.It’s asthe elitists simply assume — arrogantly — that they know better than the people they are supposed to serve .Some of the reasons given by those demanding another referendum are bizarre — to put it mildly. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, has said the Remain campaign during the original referendum fell far short of even being effective.Well, that is laughable and is no reason for going to the polls again.The simple truth is that the British voters, on both sides of the argument, deserve better of their politicians than this.n Theresa May is fighting her corner against a stubborn and obdurate team of negotiators in Brussels, who are finding her a much tougher opponent than they’d probably expected.But there are those who would like to see a little more drama and aggression on the part of the UK team.In similar circumstances, Margaret Thatcherwould thump the table and brandish her famous handbag, frightening the lives out of the Brussels team.Theresa May cannot match that — but she is adamant not to surrender and is to be commended for that.But what is urgently required is some kind of magic to sort out the shambles in the House of Commons, where at the moment getting a majority on anything appears to be a major problem.Somehow, all this has to be resolved and the Leavers get what they voted for in the referendum in a fair and honourable way. n When all this is over, major surgery will be required to restore the shattered Conservative Party back to rude health. It may well take a new leader to do that.As you might expect, the usual suspects, like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt , have both indicated they will be in the running.But in politics, it is often not the obvious names who get the crown.Has anyone thought of David Lidington — the quiet man who is Theresa May’s de facto number two  He is the dark horse to watch.But there is going to be a lot more discord before that position is reached."},{"url":null,"title":"dublin port to create parking for hundreds of trucks in nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit.

There’s not a lot of detail there.“She says she’s working with the EU, trying to find assurances. I pressed her to give a bit more detail on that. I have to say it wasn’t forthcoming.”Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told reporters in Downing Street that a second referendum would be “unavoidable”no deal was agreed by MPs and there was not a general election.“The Prime Minister should put her deal to the House of Commons and see what support she can mobilise for it and see whether there are any alternatives – a Norway-plus arrangement for example – that might have a better chance of responding to where the centre of gravity in the House of Commons may currently lie,” he said.“If the House of Commons is deadlocked we need a general election and a new House of Commons.“If we are denied that then it seems to me unavoidable that the decision would have to go back to the people.”In the Commons, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour MPs would not be forced by the shortness of time into choosing between Mrs May’s deal and no deal.In a debate called by the opposition, Sir Keir said: “I don’t think for one moment that this Housegoing to accept the binary choice that the Prime Minister will attempt to put before us.“A choice between bad and even worse is not a meaningful choice. Nor is leaving the EU on March  next year without a deal viable.“It has never been viable and as every day goes past it becomes less and less viable.”Sir Keir said that “serious consideration” should be given to extending the two-year Article  process leading to Brexit on March  .Environment Secretary Michael Gove acknowledged that a no-deal Brexit would have a “negative economic effect”.But he told the Commons Environmental Audit Committee: “It is also the case that those impacts will be acute for a short period and mitigable – not totally but to an extent.”And he reassured MPs: “Supplies of ambient products that are stored without chilling or freezing, I think will be fine. If people want Belgian beer or French wine, I don’t think that’s going to be an issue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mays postbrexit trade deal suggestion dismissed by taoiseach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

TrumpDecember , That declaration of victory is far from unanimous.The decision will fulfil Mr Trump’s long-stated goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back, arguing that Islamic State remains a threat and could regroup as it battles in Syria’s long-running civil war.Mr Trump has argued for the withdrawal since he was a presidential candidate.But the decision underscores the ision between him and his military advisers, who have said in recent weeks that pockets of IS militants remain and US policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who remains concerned about Iranian efforts in the area, reacted in non-committal fashion after talking with Mr Trump by telephone.“This is, of course, an American decision,” he said.Israel will learn of the timetable and manner of withdrawal, he said, and no matter what “we will safeguard the security of Israel and protect ourselves from this arena”.Leading Republican senators reacted with displeasure to the news.Senator Lindsey Graham, typically a Trump backer, said he was “blindsided” by the report and called the decision “a disaster in the making”.He said: “The biggest winners in this are ISIS and Iran.”There will be much resentment and feeling of abandonment that will be directed toward American personnel.The confusion surrounding our Syria policy is making le much more dficult and dangerous for Americans in the region.— Lindsey GrahamDecember , Marco Rubio of Florida said the withdrawal would be a “grave error with broader implications” beyond the fight against IS.Just last week, the US special envoy to the anti-Isis coalition, Brett McGurk, said US troops would remain in Syria even after Islamic State was driven from its strongholds.“I think it’s fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,” Mr McGurk told reporters on December .“Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished. Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.”And two weeks ago General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US still has a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilise the country.He said it will take , to , local troops in north-eastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about % of them have been trained.Mr Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said in September that the US would keep a military presence in Syria as long as Iran is active there.“We’re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias,” he said.Pulling troops out of Syria in an ongoing fight is a big mistake. Like waking away from a forest fire that is still smoldering underfoot. Big winner is Iran, then Russia, than Assad. Wrong move.— stavridisjDecember , James Stavridis, a former Navy admiral who served as top Nato commander, tweeted Wednesday that “Pulling troops out of Syria in an ongoing fight is a big mistake. Like walking away from a forest fire that is still smoldering underfoot. Big winner is Iran, then Russia, than Assad. Wrong move.”The withdrawal decision, however, is likely to be viewed positively by US ally Turkey, and comes following several conversations between Mr Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the past weeks.The Turks have targeted US-backed Kurdish troops along the Syria-Turkey border, which Turkey considers an insurgent threat.A US withdrawal – including the end of joint US and Turkish patrols along the border – could open the door for more Turkish operations against the Syrian rebels.Just hours before the withdrawal decision became public, the State Department announced late Tuesday that it had approved the sale of a . billion dollar Patriot missile defence system to Turkey.The US first launched airstrikes against IS fighters in Syria in .

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place. But the EDAC squad are delighted with their achievement anyway. The other two participation point scorers were Janine Murray and Ella Carroll.Tough in LanzaroteRising star Gordy Graham headed for the sun in Lanzarote to make his latest marathon effort and with typical cussedness, the weather promptly stuck two fingers up at him by providing a strong headwind on the out and back course, the sting in the tail being that it was in the homeward half.

Jodi Foster and her sister Kari from Spa Primary School and Erin Moore from St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Saul, finished as the top  qualiers outside the qualying teams.Alex Robinson was not so fortunate for the boys and after a slow start, he could not find his way far enough through the traffic in a field of over  runners to take a qualying position.This weekend will see the EDAC Juniors on the road again as they travel to participate in the All-Ireland Uneven Age Group Cross-Country Championships at Navan Racecourse.The seniors have an equally dficult and y journey to participate in the North West Cross-Country in Gransha Park, Derry, but at least they only have to run k when they get there.To paraphrase an old First World War marching song: ldquoItrsquos a long trip to run in Derry.And itrsquos unique too in that everyone runs together, men, women, older men and women and junior men and women.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games.

The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

Photo credit: Kirsty OConnor PA WireThe comment came as Home Secretary Sajid Javid launched the Government’s plans for immigration policy after Brexit, which Ms Sturgeon said amounted to an “act of vandalism” on the Scottish economy.Meanwhile, in Brussels, the European Commission activated plans for a possible no-deal Brexit on March , making clear that they are designed to “protect the vital interests of the EU”.A day after the Cabinet gave the green light to full-scale no-deal preparations in the UK and  days before the scheduled date of Brexit, the Commission said it was “essential and urgent” to act to avoid “major disruption”the UK crashes out without an agreement.Plans cover  areas most likely to be affected, ranging from financial services to aviation, customs and carbon emissions trading.Business groups issued a stark warning of the threat of no-deal Brexit, saying many firms are now reaching “the point of no ”.In a joint statement, the UK’s five main business organisations said contingency plans for a no-deal were a “signicant drain” on companies’ time and money.Firms are pausing or erting investment that should be boosting productivity, jobs and pay, said the British Chambers of Commerce, CBI, EEF, Institute of Directors and Federation of Small Businesses.Mrs May is understood to have urged leaders from the devolved administrations to “pull together” to back the Withdrawal Agreement she reached with Brussels in November.The Prime Minister met the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales and representatives of the Northern Ireland Civil Service at a gathering of the Joint Ministerial Committee in Downing Street as she seeks to build a Commons majority for her deal.But as she emerged from Number , Ms Sturgeon restated the Scottish National Party’s determination to vote against the deal when it s to the Commons in January.And she said it was “unacceptable” for the PM to delay the vote in the hope of “running down the clock” to Brexit and leaving MPs with the choice only between her deal and no deal.Kai Corkum: Young road crash victim had ‘a cheeky personality and a great love of le’Ivor Bell unfit to stand trial over Jean McConville death Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Ms Sturgeon, who backs a referendum on the final terms of the Brexit deal, said: “It’s beyond me that any Prime Minister would want to have as her legacy turning the UK inwards and making it less open and welcoming to people from the rest of the world.”On a visit to Heathrow on Wednesday, Mrs May said that the UK was “talking to the EU about some further assurances to assuage the concerns that Members of Parliament had on a particular issue in the Withdrawal Agreement”.But askedthe PM had spelt out what was being done, Ms Sturgeon said: “It was a wee bit nebulous. There’s not a lot of detail there.“She says she’s working with the EU, trying to find assurances. I pressed her to give a bit more detail on that. I have to say it wasn’t forthcoming.”Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford told reporters in Downing Street that a second referendum would be “unavoidable”no deal was agreed by MPs and there was not a general election.“The Prime Minister should put her deal to the House of Commons and see what support she can mobilise for it and see whether there are any alternatives - a Norway-plus arrangement for example - that might have a better chance of responding to where the centre of gravity in the House of Commons may currently lie,” he said.“If the House of Commons is deadlocked we need a general election and a new House of Commons.“If we are denied that then it seems to me unavoidable that the decision would have to go back to the people.”In the Commons, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour MPs would not be forced by the shortness of time into choosing between Mrs May’s deal and no deal.In a debate called by the opposition, Sir Keir said: “I don’t think for one moment that this Housegoing to accept the binary choice that the Prime Minister will attempt to put before us.“A choice between bad and even worse is not a meaningful choice. Nor is leaving the EU on March  next year without a deal viable.“It has never been viable and as every day goes past it becomes less and less viable.”Sir Keir said that “serious consideration” should be given to extending the two-year Article  process leading to Brexit on March  .Environment Secretary Michael Gove acknowledged that a no-deal Brexit would have a “negative economic effect”.But he told the Commons Environmental Audit Committee: “It is also the case that those impacts will be acute for a short period and mitigable - not totally but to an extent.”And he reassured MPs: “Supplies of ambient products that are stored without chilling or freezing, I think will be fine.

This was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes. The commission has also agreed to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year. In the meantime, the fishing fleet will continue to do its best to avoid whiting by deploying the best available selective fishing gear.”Under the deal, the prawn quota has been reduced by % in order to stay within sustainable levels. The herring quota is down %, but quotas for cod, haddock, plaice and sole have all increased.A government spokesperson said the deal “ensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily”.The DAERA spokesperson stressed that since  the Northern Ireland fishing fleet, working with fisheries scientists in AFBI, has made major efforts and achieved signicant reductions in unwanted catches.Reacting to the agreements reached, Mr McCulla said: “For the Irish Sea there are some positives and some negatives. All Irish Sea fish stocks are managed to international criteria – Maximum Sustainable Yield. So overall what is a sustainable deal puts Northern Ireland’s fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.”UK set to slip down global economic league table Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNo Deal Brexit plan will see , British troops put on standbyThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayREVEALED: In pictures - every police station closed in Northern Ireland in last two decadesStorm causes lorries to topple on board PO ferryMajor incident on board N.I. ferry - What we know so far          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

immigration system","story":"The new measure, which would be in place until at least , is designed to act as a ldquosafety valve for the economy and protect sectors reliant on lower skilled overseas labour.It would be open to nationals from specied countries, regardless of their skill level or whether they have a definite job offer.Applicants would need to apply for a visa which would be limited to  months, at which point a ldquocooling-off period will take effect, meaning they could notunder the same route for the next year.While in the UK, they would not be entitled to access public funds or switch to other routes, bring dependant family members or seek permanent settlement.The proposed short-term work route forms part of the most signicant shake-up of the immigration regime for more than  years, set out in a long-awaited White Paper that will apply following the post-Brexit implementation period, which ends in December .Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ldquoTodayrsquos proposals are the biggest change to our immigration system in a generation.ldquoThese measures will boost our economy and benefit the British people.Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ldquoWhile these proposals are not quite as bad as we had originally feared, itrsquos no secret that companies across the UK are sceptical about whether the Governmentrsquos approach will actually deliver on their practical, real-world concerns.Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said:ldquoThese are shocking proposals which run completely against the current of public opinion and which are likely to result in even more massive levels of immigration.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott hit out at the delay in producing the paper, adding: ldquoIt will not meet the needs of migrants for certainty, it will not meet the needs of employers for a stable, skilled workforce.Noting that the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluded there should be no dedicated route for unskilled labour, the Governmentrsquos document said there is no intention to open one.However, it said employers have become reliant on lower skilled workers from the EU for certain jobs, adding that sectors like construction and social care would find it dficult to adapt immediately after free movement ends.The paper said: ldquoWe have listened to the concerns of businesses hellip and so there will be a route allowing temporary short-term workers to come for a year.The scheme would be open to all skill levels, with no sponsorship requirement.It would be subject to ldquotightly defined conditions and only open to migrants from ldquospecied low-risk countries.Numbers admitted through the route may also be restricted, while the Government stressed it was a ldquotransitory measure and would be subject to a full review by .The paper said it was ldquouncertain how many temporary migrants may come under the system, noting that estimates for the year ending June  suggest around , EU nationals and , non-EU nationals arrived for work-related reasons for between one and  months.There would also be a new visa route for skilled workers, who will be entitled to stay for longer, bring dependants and in some cases settle permanently.This would be open to migrants from all countries, provided they are sponsored by an employer.As expected, the numerical cap on skilled workers ndash currently , a year ndash would be axed.While the Government intends to impose a minimum salary threshold, the paper stopped short of committing to a specic figure following widespread opposition to proposals that it should be pound,.Former home secretary Amber Rudd, who now holds the Work and Pensions brief in the Cabinet, told ITVrsquos Peston: ldquoI think it will need to come down in order to address the real need that businesses have for lower-salaried people, who are often skilled people but come in at lower salaries..@AmberRuddHR says the salary threshold for the Governmentrsquos new immigration policy will need to come down to address business concerns #Peston pic RrJjtWdUWmdash PestonDecember , The new skilled work route would be opened up to workers with ldquointermediate level skills.Among the occupations that would become eligible are driving instructors, plumbers and restaurant managers.In an effort to speed up the recruitment process, employers of skilled migrants would no longer be required to carry out a ldquoresident labour market test.In other features of the system:ndash Anyone who wants to come to the UK would need some form of permissionndash EU visitors will not require a visa in advance of travel but an Electronic Travel Authorisation scheme would be introducedndash There would continue to be no limit on the number of international students who could come to study in the UKndash Existing rules on bringing family members to the country, including minimum income requirements, would be extended to settled EU citizensIntroducing the document, Prime Minister Theresa May wrote: ldquoThis will be a system where it is workersrsquo skills that matter, not which country they come from.ldquoIt will

This is truly disgraceful. What is being proposed, even as an interim measure, feels very cruel and inhumane.“Whereas funerals in NI usually take place three days after death, in England it is more typical to have a period of up to a week or even longer. The time between a death and the funeral taking place is especially traumatic so I am concerned that parents here will be forced to endure even longer delays as they are forced to follow the usual time-frames across the water.“I am disgusted, I am angry and I feel ashamed that this is even happening here.“As a parent who has been through this terrible experience, I feel very upset. Upset at the thought of what is ahead of grieving mothers and fathers. This cannot be allowed to continue. This is simply wrong.“I cannot and will not accept that the only way this can be done is by the transportation by air or sea of deceased babies and infants. It is just wrong. “There has also been discussion with counterparts in the south ofan all island solution. Whilst I welcome discussion on the issue, and would not object, it is importantto remember that all-island solutions are not always the panacea. It is also important to note that the number of paediatric pathologists thereis presently five and is also in decline.”A motion branding the decision unacceptable was passed by the Council this week.Refurbishment of Corcrain Shops could take six months Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingFatal car crash victim, , is namedRespected businessman Niall Irwin, a director of Irwinrsquos Bakery passes awayBars went into lockdown amid reports of armed man lsquoon the rampagersquoRoad closed due to crashYouths on crime spree target vulnerable elderly woman          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
