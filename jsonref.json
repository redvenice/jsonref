But it seems things have not moved, the frugals keep on insisting on their position,\u0027 one diplomat said on Friday morning. However, the poorer southern and eastern European nations want to keep generous EU funds coming regardless of Brexit. French leader Emmanuel Macron has backed calls to resist spending cuts, saying it would be \u0027unacceptable\u0027 to \u0027compensate the departure of the British by reducing spending\u0027.    European Council chief Charles Michel has tabled a draft budget of €1.09trillion, which represents 1.074 per cent of gross national income of EU27 countries. The current long-term budget for 2014-2020 is €1.08trillion, which represents 1.02 per cent of gross national income for the EU28, before Britain\u0027s departure.          European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen (right) meets with leaders of three of the \u0027Frugal Four\u0027: Austria\u0027s Sebastian Kurz, Holland\u0027s Mark Rutte and Sweden\u0027s Stefan Lofven         Merkel greets Macron on the sidelines of the summit yesterday, where the 27 leaders are battling for a share of the EU\u0027s €1trillion budget Michel was last night meeting with each leader one-by-one to discuss their grievances and demands.  \u0027There are lot of concerns, priorities, and interests,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m well aware that the final steps that must be taken to find a compromise are always the most difficult.\u0027  German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hoped \u0027we get at least a good deal further,\u0027 but said that \u0027for net contributors the balance is not right yet.\u0027     Finland\u0027s 34-year-old prime minister Sanna Marin said the member states are \u0027still quite far away from each other\u0027. \u0027There is a lot of ambition to this budget. But let\u0027s be realistic - Britain has left the EU and we are in a new position,\u0027 she said. \u0027The proposal has gone in the wrong direction. Finland thinks the overall level is a bit too high, we would like to have it more moderate.\u0027  Dutch leader Rutte said he could not back a proposal that allocates a third of the budget for development funds and another third for farmers. Agriculture accounts for around one per cent of the EU\u0027s economy, but soaks up billions in subsidies.          European Council chief Charles Michel (left) speaks to Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the summit in Brussels yesterday         Ursula von der Leyen (centre) meets European Parliament president David-Maria Sassoli and Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa in Brussels yesterday \u0027I cannot sign up to this proposal. The proposal is simply not good,\u0027 Rutte told reporters ahead of the talks. Outside the summit centre, farmers rolled tractors down the street to push their demands for sufficient funds. France, the number two contributor after Germany, wants to safeguard subsidies for farmers but is uneasy about the growth of so-called \u0027cohesion\u0027 funds for poorer nations.  Germany, the Netherlands and others are keen to shift funds towards new priorities including global warming, migration and growth in the digital economy. The EU budget is drawn from national contributions as well as money from customs duties, a cut of sales tax and fines levied on companies.  The bloc is also looking for new sources of revenue, but the leaders are split on a proposed tax on plastic waste or sharing profits from carbon emissions trade.Officials warn that without a deal by the end of the year, the bloc will have to freeze most of its projects from 2021.         "},{"url":null,"title":"Lobo feline looks just like werewolf thanks genetic mutation","story":"Share this article At home, Lobo is said to be very energetic, loves to play and has plenty of time for his owners.Martin, who works as a professional photographer, captured these pictures of the couple\u0027s hairless cat during his time off.

But we didn\u0027t know her and it is presumptuous to think we can understand her mental turmoil and the reasons for it.         The widespread assumption is that Caroline\u0027s suicide was a response to her impending trial — she was accused of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton — and the subsequent fallout Speculation as to why someone takes his or her life is dangerous, because it provides an over-simplified narrative of cause and effect.Indeed, the Samaritans warn against conjecture on social media or in the Press, because there is a wealth of strong evidence that shows suicide can be \u0027catching\u0027 — it can trigger copycat behaviour.This doesn\u0027t mean we should shy away from discussing suicide, far from it. But it must be handled carefully so vulnerable people do not take the wrong message from often good-intentioned attempts to shine a spotlight on suicide.And I do worry how people with suicidal tendencies might react to the wall-to-wall coverage — understandable though it might be — of Caroline\u0027s death.Suicidal feelings are horrible and crippling, but they do pass. Treatment and support is available, and people need to know where to find it. And while they may feel sometimes that their friends or family will be better off without them, the bleak reality is that the impact of suicide on loved ones is devastating and can cause long-term suffering to those left behind.For many years I\u0027ve worked in A\u0026ampE talking to and assessing suicidal people. When I started, I was wary and reticent.What if I said something insensitive or stupid? What would I do if they told me they were thinking of harming themselves?But over time I came to appreciate that a great deal of good can be done by talking about it — people will drop the pretence and be honest about how they feel.Sometimes that\u0027s all they need. Simply talking about those feelings is enough.Every A\u0026ampE department has access to mental health professionals, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Anyone who feels vulnerable to self-harm or is experiencing suicidal thoughts can walk in and ask to speak to someone.I believe absolutely that there is always another option to suicide, no matter how desperate, isolated, worried, distressed or overwhelmed a person might feel.They just need to know where to find help — and that is a responsibility all of us share in looking out for others.Finally, perhaps we should heed the advice in another of Caroline\u0027s Instagram posts: \u0027In a world where you can be anything, be kind.\u0027 For confidential support, call the Samaritans on 116 123, visit a branch or see samaritans.org.   It\u0027s not so wise to kick out patientsAs a doctor who has been assaulted several times, I welcome robust responses from managers to ensure staff safety.Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced this week that NHS staff can refuse to treat patients who show sexist, homophobic or racist behaviour from April.This comes as figures show staff who have experienced bullying, harassment or abuse has risen by a quarter in five years.On duty, I\u0027ve been spat at, shouted at, punched, kicked and even held hostage. I\u0027ve also been on the receiving end of homophobic abuse.         Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced this week that NHS staff can refuse to treat patients who show sexist, homophobic or racist behaviour from AprilViolence towards staff is not tolerated in the NHS and perpetrators need to know their behaviour is not acceptable.But refusing to treat them isn\u0027t always the answer.Once in A\u0026ampE I overheard a patient verbally abusing a gay nurse. Other staff intervened and the nurse was ushered away, while someone else stepped in to care for the man.Staff acted professionally, but made clear their disapproval.The man clearly felt awkward. After his treatment, the nurse he\u0027d abused came and sat next to him. They had a heartfelt discussion and the patient ended up apologising profusely.When he was discharged, he hugged the nurse and returned later with chocolates. Would the same have happened if he had been kicked out?  Why the human touch is essentialI\u0027ve written on these pages before how important human contact, especially touch, is for our mental wellbeing and physical health.So I was not surprised by research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting this week that showed newborn babies deprived of human touch can experience problems as they grow up, even into adulthood.Newborns who need to be kept in an incubator may struggle with sleep, stress and emotions later in life — yet babies with similar treatment needs, but who also receive some skin-to-skin contact, or \u0027kangaroo care\u0027, do not face the same issues.While this is an important factor to consider in treatment plans for babies, I also wonder what impact human touch has on the elderly, particularly those in care homes who don\u0027t get many visits from their relatives. Their need for touch is entirely neglected — reduced to being washed, dressed, changed or turned by nurses who are often wearing gloves.We think about these patients\u0027 physical needs, but what about their emotional needs?  Dr Max prescribes...

They weren\u0027t good — but if I\u0027d left it any longer, they could have been a lot worse.I don\u0027t want to tempt fate and say that Tom saved my life, because I\u0027ve still got to beat this thing. But it can\u0027t be denied that my pal from Pontypridd has given me the best chance possible.The doctors say my cancer hasn\u0027t spread. In a high percentage of cases like mine, treatment will be completely successful. I\u0027m having a course of injections — I used to play golf with Bruce Forsyth so I\u0027ve been needled by the best. That man knew how to get under your skin, I\u0027ll tell you, especially when you were teeing up for a big shot.When the jabs are done, I\u0027ll have a course of tablets, and then there\u0027s a yearly cycle of treatment. The specialist who saw me said there\u0027s never a cast-iron guarantee, even if the cancer is completely eradicated, that it won\u0027t come back.But then, there were never any guarantees that you wouldn\u0027t get it in the first place.\u0027What I can promise,\u0027 the consultant said, \u0027is that we are aiming to delay the disease. I can\u0027t say for how long, but it\u0027s quite possible that it will be a very long delay indeed — a delay that lasts the rest of your life, until you die of something else entirely.\u0027Very funny, Doc. I nearly told him to leave the jokes to me, but then I decided to take him at his word.And I\u0027m encouraged by the experience of another friend, Sir Rod Stewart, who let it be known last year he\u0027d been given the \u0027all clear\u0027 after treatment. Like Tom, he\u0027s become a great advocate for raising awareness.Anyway, I\u0027m intending to be around for at least another 20 years and certainly until my 100th birthday, when I\u0027ll get a telegram from Buckingham Palace addressed to Lord Tarby of Palladium.All my life I\u0027ve been a lucky fella, and I have never been more conscious of it than now, because I have all the love and support any man could need from my wonderful family.My wife of almost 61 years, Pauline, has been my rock, as always. I don\u0027t have to worry about a thing as long as she\u0027s at my side (except putting the bins out, of course . . . I\u0027ll do it in a minute, Love!).It\u0027s worse for my kids, really, Cheryl, Liza and James, because everyone knows who their dad is. Since I revealed my diagnosis this week they\u0027ve been inundated with questions from concerned friends, all asking how I am.That gets tiring pretty fast. What are they supposed to say — \u0027Oh, he\u0027s fine, apart from the cancer\u0027?I can say that, partly because it\u0027s funny, partly because it\u0027s true, but I\u0027m well aware that the gag doesn\u0027t work for everyone.         \u0027My rock\u0027: Jimmy and his wife of nearly 61 years, Pauline I\u0027d never thought about it before, but in many ways cancer is harder for the family than the patient.There is lots for me to do — hospital visits, talking to the Mail, I\u0027m rushed off my feet. There\u0027s much less for the kids to do (though if you three are reading this, could one of you nip round and put the bins out? Ta).In fact, I feel so good that I\u0027m planning a tour.The older I get, the less I enjoy hours spent on the road, but I will always relish a good gig. And some of my jokes are so old that they need to be taken out and aired, or they might turn to dust. So don\u0027t be surprised if you see me at a theatre near you very soon.\u0027Jimmy Tarbuck,\u0027 the posters will say, \u0027more popular than he realised.\u0027 Because the best thing about having cancer has been the great rush of love and friendship from well-wishers. People have stopped me in the street near my home — and not just one or two but lots — to tell me what a lovely fella I am.They\u0027ve said it so much, I\u0027m starting to believe it.What do you say when a woman you\u0027ve never met tells you she thinks you\u0027re great and that her gran used to fancy you? You have to laugh, but to tell you the truth I\u0027ve been so touched that once or twice I\u0027ve felt the tears welling up.It\u0027s a wonderful feeling, like a standing ovation just going for a walk to the newsagent\u0027s. Thinking about that lady\u0027s gran makes me realise how long I\u0027ve been in the business. I was doing gigs in Liverpool pubs when The Beatles were still a backing band for Tony Sheridan, and Cilla Black was Priscilla White, the cloakroom girl at the Cavern Club.For more than 55 years, since I took over from Brucie as host of Sunday Night At The Palladium, I\u0027ve been appearing on televisions in millions of homes.In many cases, it was a brief engagement, a fleeting appearance as you ed for the off switch, yelling: \u0027Ruddy Nora, I\u0027m not having him!\u0027 But still, there I was, in your living room.So I\u0027ve earned the right to yell at you now, like Tom Jones yelled at me.Take your fingers out of your ears.

Our journal also includes lots of tips on how to make this diet work for you — some gleaned from the rapidly growing Fast 800 communityLast year, I introduced Daily Mail readers to the Fast 800 Diet, which pulled together the most up-to-date research on the benefits of intermittent fasting — on which I based my original 5:2 diet — and included the option of a rapid weight-loss plan, in which you eat 800 calories every day to kick-start your regimen and reap many health benefits.As well as rapid weight-loss, following the Fast 800 approach should help put type 2 diabetes into remission and reduce the risk of heart disease and other chronic diseases.When I lost 9kg (nearly 20lb) on the 5:2 diet in 2012 I reversed my diabetes diagnosis and restored my blood sugar levels to normal, which they have remained ever since.I\u0027m regularly stopped in the street by people who say that the diet has changed their lives — like the driver of a coach I was travelling on, who grabbed me to say he\u0027d been on insulin for 16 years until he started my diet. He had lost more than five stone and was now off all medication. It\u0027s simply amazing.         As well as rapid weight-loss, following the Fast 800 approach should help put type 2 diabetes into remission and reduce the risk of heart disease and other chronic diseasesAlthough the Fast 800 is a diet, I\u0027m not obsessed about weight loss for the sake of it — more for the health benefits it can bring, such as fixing metabolic disorders including diabetes, and cutting your risk of dementia and depression.Clare and I are keen to make the Fast 800 Diet as easy to stick to as possible — and we strongly believe our journal is another tool with which to do that. We know it works because Clare and I tested it out on lots of enthusiastic volunteers, and some of Clare\u0027s patients tried it. In testing it, we were able to refine what to include.As well as helping people get organised with lists, plans and charts, it also offers inspiration, with brand new delicious Recipes of the Week — from tasty curries to baked mozzarella fritters — specially created by Clare and one of the UK\u0027s leading healthy-eating recipe writers, Justine Pattison.IDENTIFY YOUR BAD HABITSWe hope to fire up your motivation with top tips and stories from real dieters, as well as help you identify bad habits and avoid tempting situations that could unintentionally scupper the best-laid weight-loss plan.Perhaps you\u0027re not sleeping well or are stressed at work. The journal gives you space to analyse these parts of your life and, by encouraging you to make helpful lifestyle changes, will allow you to establish a positive cycle.In many ways, our journal is the opposite of Instagram. You don\u0027t show off in a diary, you are yourself. You\u0027re confronting your reality — and that means your bad habits. This is the key to making your diet a success. I would, of course, encourage you to take \u0027before\u0027 and \u0027after\u0027 pictures when you have reached your target weight, and share them widely. It is great to celebrate your achievements with others.         The journal gives you space to analyse these parts of your life and, by encouraging you to make helpful lifestyle changes, will allow you to establish a positive cycle That said, the real secret to long-lasting success is addressing the underlying issues behind any weight gain.As I previously mentioned, the power of keeping a food journal has been backed up again and again in scientific research.For example, my son Jack, who is a doctor, did a research project with Professor Roy Taylor of Newcastle University — whose groundbreaking work first inspired me to create the Fast 800 — looking at the characteristics of successful dieters.For Jack\u0027s Masters he interviewed dozens of people who had lost lots of weight through doing a rapid weight-loss diet. Many had kept the pounds off, but some hadn\u0027t.As well as the support of friends and family, Jack found that regular self-monitoring and tracking daily activity was important for long-term success.Keeping an honest record of the food you\u0027ve consumed really does make isolating bad eating habits much easier. Occasionally, people come up to me and say: \u0027I\u0027m following your diet, but I\u0027m not losing weight\u0027. To which I normally reply: \u0027I\u0027m very sorry to hear that. Have you tried keeping a record of what you are eating?\u0027Because it really is impossible not to lose weight on an 800-calories-a-day diet.BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU EATIf you are not losing weight then it\u0027s because you are not being totally honest about your food intake. A few years ago I was involved in an experiment with a young, overweight woman who claimed to be eating less than 1,400 calories a day.With her consent we gave her a drink containing something called \u0027doubly labelled water\u0027. This contains an element which allows scientists to accurately measure how many calories you are burning, and therefore how many you are really consuming.The test revealed she was actually consuming more than twice her claimed 1,400 calories. No wonder she wasn\u0027t losing weight. An honest food journal can be a bit of a shocker at first, but it\u0027s the kind of shock you need if you\u0027re truly going to meet your weight-loss goals.As well as that blast of honesty, keeping a journal will help you get organised — a vital ingredient in the success of any diet.          Maintain a full store-cupboard of practical, healthy cookery essentials, tooThere\u0027s space for a weekly shopping list and an easy-to-use weekly meal planner that will help keep you on the straight and narrow. Spontaneity, after all, is a dieter\u0027s number-one enemy, as it opens the door to all sorts of bad food choices.You might think all this planning sounds like hard work, but it\u0027s only encouraging you to behave as your canny grandmother might have done when doing her food shopping.Buy items with a proper meal in mind, rather than just making random purchases which can only encourage snacking and mindless eating.Maintain a full store-cupboard of practical, healthy cookery essentials, too.When it comes to cooking at home, Clare does most of it, but I do a fair bit, too.And while we cook in entirely different ways — Clare is fantastic at looking in the fridge and concocting a meal out of nothing, whereas I tend to follow recipes — we have one thing in common. Neither of us likes complicated recipes with lots of ingredients, or wants to spend hours in the kitchen cooking.The Fast 800 recipes reflect the reality of a busy life, so if they work for us, they\u0027ll certainly work for you. If we can get this organised in the kitchen, anyone can.This organisation can bring holistic benefits as well as practical ones. Honing all the details of your diet in the pages of our journal can lead to a real sense of resolution, and create the right headspace. Removing excessive choice takes away pressure, bringing inner peace.Indeed, we found people appreciated anything that took decisions away from them. Not to mention the fact that when you have everything planned out, with targets set in stone, you can only feel a sense of achievement when meeting them.ADMIT MOMENTS OF WEAKNESSIt\u0027s no coincidence that we ask you to monitor your mood daily as part of the journal. Bad food choices can often come as a direct result of bad moods.Pinpointing your emotions can really help with this. People\u0027s poor eating habits can be very ingrained, after all. In contrast, eating healthy Mediterranean-style food, which this diet is based on, has been found to boost mood and motivation.That said, though, we\u0027ve found that within less than a week, most dieters feel much better than they did — and, vitally, they don\u0027t feel hungry. In a very short time you can reset your metabolism.There are plenty of crazy diets out there. Clare recently saw one which advised people with a BMI over 40 to eat toast and jam as a snack before bed!Such constant snacking is fatal. Indeed, this \u0027diet\u0027 advised three regular meals and three snacks a day. That\u0027s effectively six meals which is, to my mind, non-stop, all-day eating. With such a \u0027diet\u0027, you are never going to burn fat.         You can start doing TRE by simply having your evening meal a bit earlier and your breakfast a bit later One of the other elements I introduced with the Fast 800 programme is Time Restricted Eating, or TRE. It involves eating all of your calories within a relatively narrow time window each day — usually one of ten to 12 hours.This extends the length of your normal overnight fast (the time when you are asleep and not eating), and gives your body a vital opportunity to burn fat and do essential repairs.You can start doing TRE by simply having your evening meal a bit earlier and your breakfast a bit later.Once you\u0027ve got used to this, you can move to the 14:10 (where you eat all your calories in a ten-hour window each day, such as 10am to 8pm, and fast for 14 hours) or even to the 16:8, favoured by Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman.We\u0027ve included a space in the journal to record your progress with TRE. It\u0027s a real booster for both your weight and health.With our new journal, let us help you on the next step of your weight-loss journey.

There was still the matter of legal fees to deal with. The court had ruled that Mrs Lejonvarn\u0027s costs should be assessed on what is known as a \u0027standard basis\u0027, rather than an indemnity basis.Indemnity costs are awarded as a penalty where there has been culpable behaviour on the part of the paying party, while with standard basis the court will allow only costs proportionate to matters at issue.Again, Mrs Lejonvarn appealed and, earlier this month, the court again found in her favour. Lord Justice Coulson ruled that the Burgesses\u0027 decision to continue was partly born out of \u0027an irrational desire\u0027 to punish Mrs Lejonvarn, which was \u0027unlinked to the merits of the claims\u0027.So why on earth did the Burgesses keep throwing good money after bad? They say that, at the start of the dispute, they were advised that their maximum \u0027exposure\u0027 if the case went against them was £100,000, but that cost started to spiral out of control after Mrs Lejonvarn switched lawyers.Mrs Burgess says that \u0027what started as a small disagreement with both sides using local law firms\u0027 changed dramatically when City lawyers Stephenson Harwood started to represent Mrs Lejonvarn on a no-win, no-fee basis, known as a \u0027conditional fee agreement\u0027.\u0027They proceeded to throw everything they could at the second trial,\u0027 she said.The couple also point out that Stephenson Harwood has in the past acted for the firm for whom Mr Lejonvarn works. But Mr Flannery QC insists that is just a coincidence and that he had in fact first been introduced to Mrs Lejonvarn by an old friend.         After falling out with Mrs Lejonvarn, the Burgesses sued her for £265,000, claiming she had botched the job. But, following endless hearings, last week the Court of Appeal (above) ruled against them — landing the couple with a legal bill of £1.5 millionAnd the Burgesses themselves are wealthier than most.\u0027We won\u0027t be living out on the streets or anything like that, but we have had to borrow money against the house,\u0027 says Mr Burgess when asked if they can afford the legal fees. \u0027We took out the first mortgage to pay for the garden, which should have cost £78,000, but cost £400,000 to put right.\u0027We then had to take out another mortgage to pay our own legal fees because they were so high. We accepted that. We were going to pay a fair set of costs.\u0027And now they can run up £1 million of costs with the luxury of not having to pay if she lost. When you get on this treadmill, you can\u0027t get off.\u0027Why didn\u0027t they accept the £25,000 that Mrs Lejonvarn had initially offered and be done with it?\u0027The claim was for almost £200,000 then and we seemed to be more in the driver\u0027s seat at that point. The advice we took was that we should pursue it,\u0027 says Mrs Burgess. \u0027So we didn\u0027t take it.\u0027Should they choose, the couple could now take the case to the Supreme Court.\u0027We are really loathe to do that,\u0027 says Mrs Burgess. \u0027It has gone on for much too long and we want to put an end to this. It is just stressing us both out and especially Peter because, more than anything, his health is the critical issue.\u0027As a result of the strokes, Mr Burgess has had trouble walking and talking. \u0027His strokes are definitely a direct result of stress,\u0027 says his wife. \u0027It has been a roller coaster over the past number of years. Just when we think things have been sorted out then, whoosh, they all go up again.\u0027As for the garden, can they even bear to look at it now?\u0027It is a beautiful garden,\u0027 insists Mrs Burgess. \u0027We don\u0027t view it with the baggage it came with. When we got the original quote from the landscaper, we now realise it was a very good quote, but at the time we thought: \u0027Gosh, it is so expensive.\u0027 If I had to do it all over again I would just go with the original.\u0027And their former friend?\u0027There is too much hating people in the world,\u0027 says Mr Burgess. \u0027I just want to forget about it and get on with my life.\u0027 His wife adds: \u0027Do we wish we\u0027d never started this process? Yes. The only winners have been the lawyers.\u0027And so, perhaps, it\u0027s only fair to give the last word to Mr Flannery. Albeit words the Burgesses probably won\u0027t want to hear.\u0027I will say in my 30 years as a solicitor, I have never had a case that was more deserving of the result that this case has had,\u0027 he says. \u0027I have never seen a claim less meritorious than theirs fought with such ferocity by them and fought with such unstopping firepower.\u0027Every letter was met with a longer letter, every query with a longer query. They stopped at nothing. They wanted to punish her. Mr Burgess has simply had his retribution. He has met his nemesis. And that\u0027s what happens in true justice.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"BBC presenter Mishal Husain paid oil gas forums","story":"Share this article However environmental groups have claimed that the corporation\u0027s reputation could be at risk if it lets journalists earn money from industries which pollute. Extinction Rebellion said: \u0027This is yet another uncomfortable example of the insidious relationship between fossil fuel companies and the media.\u0027 It comes after MPs demanded the BBC to publish a \u0027register of presenters\u0027 interests to allow greater scrutiny.               The Radio 4\u0027s Today programme presenter (left and right) has appeared at the Oslo Energy Forum and a conference staged by Equinor, Norway\u0027s state-controlled oil company in the past\u0027There should be a register of interests so the public can see what they are doing,\u0027 Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told the Daily Mail last April. Other high-profile presenters have previously been scrutinised for their appearances at business events.For example Fiona Bruce, who is paid £255,000-a-year for her role as Question Time host, had to pull out of a Henley \u0026amp Partners conference last year.She and business editor Simon Jack were set to speak but it was then revealed that the company had been accused of unwittingly helping criminals obtain passports. Jon Sopel has also been critisised for his appearances.

Isolated on the edge of the Yorkshire moors, the Brontë siblings spent their formative years squeezing minute script on to precious paper, collaborating and competing to tell slyly overblown sagas of imaginary lands – Angria, Gondal and the great city of Glass Town.Isabel Greenberg’s acclaimed previous works, The Encyclopedia of Early Earth and The One Hundred Nights of Hero, foregrounded young storytellers weaving tales of icy wastes, crumbling towers and battles for love and freedom. Now she sets the Brontës’ juvenilia at the heart of her latest graphic novel.Greenberg shows Branwell, Emily, Anne and Charlotte (her main focus), cloistered “like potatoes growing in a dark cellar”, as a schoolfriend puts it, and the melodrama that sprouts from them. They work together to build Glass Town and its prime movers – the scheming Earl of Northangerland, his reforming wife Zenobia, put-upon daughter Mary Percy, dashing son Zamorna and adopted son Quashia. But Emily and Anne grow frustrated with their elder siblings’ dominance, and abandon Glass Town to create the new land of Gondal. The sisters are sent one by one to boarding school. And Glass Town hurtles to war.Greenberg blurs fiction and memoir: characters walk between worlds and woo their creators. Pivotal periods such as Charlotte’s schooling in Belgium, where she because obsessed with her tutor, a possible model for Mr Rochester, are omitted: instead Greenberg focuses on the delights and dangers of “an interior world that was brighter, more golden” than reality.And bright it is. Greenberg contrasts the tropical sky of Glass Town with the wind and rain of the moors, dim English interiors with pungent reds and yellows, picturing epic mountains and seas, lakes of ink and giant quills. Her protagonists look wonky but feel wonderfully real, lips tight with forbearance or smiles wide with joy, while the sharp, concise dialogue rings sad and true.This is a tale, bookended by funerals, about the collision between dreamlike places of possibility and constrained 19th-century lives. None of the Brontës would reach 40. Branwell, of whom so much was expected, died an unfulfilled alcoholic, while his sisters were held back by convention – Emily, Charlotte and Anne published under assumed masculine names. Yet publish they did: their work still entrances us, and Greenberg gives their tangled early creations gripping and generous life.• Glass Town by Isabel Greenberg is published by Jonathan Cape (£19.99).

Who can resist them? Gossip! Rumour! Scandal! Ruffs! Backstabbing! Madrigals! Farthingales! Witchcraft! Lace-on velvet sleeves! Cut-off body parts! More!We know the plot, or at least its bare outlines, but we seem compelled to relive it in books, films, plays, operas, and television series: and all the more so when viewed through the shrewd, calculating, vengeful, cautious, Machiavellian eyes of master game-player Thomas Cromwell, fixer and hitman to Henry VIII, as rendered in sumptuous, riveting detail by Hilary Mantel in Wolf Hall. If Cromwell had had a phone Mantel could hack, you’d scarcely be brought closer to the inner wheels and cogs of his bloody-minded and bloody-handed machinations.Bring Up the Bodies picks up from Wolf Hall. Things are not going well for Anne Boleyn, who has beguiled her way into the queendom over the cast-off though not yet dead body of Katherine of Aragon, but has failed to produce a male heir. Nor is she playing her cards adroitly: she’s too smart, too argumentative, too intent on influencing policy, too secretly Protestant, and too prone to miscarriages. It’s clear that Henry now wants to be rid of her, having spotted a more docile girl in Jane Seymour and once he’s made this wish explicit, Cromwell goes to work. It’s always a dicey job, being henchman to an absolutist tyrant, especially one who’s becoming increasingly paranoid and petulant. There was that fall from the horse and the concussion, and then the weeping sore on his leg: what exactly was wrong with Henry? Doctors are still pondering but whatever it was, it did not improve his temper.We’re the silent sharers of Cromwell’s deliberations as he weaves his way to his goal – the removal of Anne, and, not incidentally, payback for the courtiers who had humiliated his old master, Cardinal Wolsey – through secret dealing, blackmailing, hectoring, torturing, and the stage-managing of a bogus show trial worthy of Stalin. We know the story won’t end well for him – henchmen often capsize – but we watch with horror and admiration as he achieves his gruesome ends.Mantel’s triumph is to make us understand – and even like, in a grudging sort of way – this historically unattractive figure. Her meticulous research is lightly worn, unlike the carefully considered fabrics and textures of the courtiers, and her depiction of the many flawed human instruments on which Cromwell plays is sadly convincing.I await the forthcoming third volume, The Mirror \u0026amp the Light, with great anticipation. There’s an axe in it somewhere, I’m guessing. No spoilers though.Ben MilesI had heard that the Royal Shakespeare Company was going to dramatise Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies and so when, a few months down the line, I got a call asking if I’d like to play Thomas Cromwell I was excited and slightly daunted. That was the beginning of my journey with Cromwell, and also with Hilary Mantel, who I first met in the RSC rehearsal rooms. Having just read her books it really hit home what an incredible piece of work they are.Of course the stakes were high, but through it all we had the writer. Hilary became a great editor and adapter of her own work. We’d be rehearsing a scene that wouldn’t quite click and in 20 minutes she would rewrite it and it would work. If she said “leave that with me” she’d come back the next morning and there’d be a far better version of the scene which you could learn in an instant because it sounded so much like the characters you were playing.I loved inhabiting and reading the stories and it’s hard to pick a favourite. But I’ve just been reading the section where Ambassador Chapuys comes to dinner with Cromwell. There are fabulously intimate one-to-one moments in the room: you can hear the timber creaking in the chair, taste and smell the food being served by the cook - the eels, the apricots, the sauces – and then there’s the conversation, which is delicate, world changing, threatening, light, funny, horrific. It’s all there as these two great men discuss greater men than themselves. I often get transported into that room and feel if as if I’m simply transcribing what’s going on in a world in which I’ve been placed. These books are the most wonderful social and psychological studies.Colm TóibínIn the London of 1782, many spectres haunt the Giant O’Brien. These include his own failing health, and also the prospect of another, even larger giant following from Ireland to compete with him. The fact that he continues, painfully, to grow in size makes him melancholy, and the rumour of a performing pig that can count and read makes him wonder. Most chillingly, for the reader, there is a bodysnatching doctor who wishes, when the Giant’s demise occurs, to possess his bones in the name of science. In the meantime, O’Brien and his hangers-on get what income they can from putting on a peep-show: pay money and see a giant. All around them are men and women, many from Ireland, down on their luck, some of them almost starving. When they are not scrambling to survive, they sit around and drink and tell stories, O’Brien the most intelligent and best raconteur among them.The novel is written in darting, suggestive sentences the dialogue, in all its stoical tones and elements of good and bad humour, is like a chorus, or a commentary on life and its hardships. Using hints and clues, a deceptive indirection, Mantel allows us to enter the wounded spirit of her giant and the restless mind of the inquiring and ambitious doctor-cum-bodysnatcher. Their circling of each other is conducted with slow subtlety, but also with an unsparing sense of doom.The writing has a dark, sly wit. The Giant himself often becomes magnificently eloquent, his very height, it seems, giving rise to exalted thoughts and extended anecdotes. The novel feels guarded, intimate. Mantel has no interest here in panorama, or painting a large-scale portrait of late 18th-century London. Instead, the drama is between the characters their lives and their visions are, by necessity, circumscribed, which gives the texture of the novel an intensity. There are moments that dramatise the tension between Ireland and England, but that is just background. In the foreground are hunger and greed, and many types of distraction, not least the hope of money and a sense of abiding fatality and the arrival of other so-called freaks, including a woman who eats pins.Towards the end of the book, the Giant “has learned this lesson: anything you can imagine, can exist”. In her novel, Mantel conjures up this world in all its strangeness with astonishing single mindedness. Anything she imagines comes into complex life. The text gives you no clue about the author or her concerns, her own history or her opinions. Instead, Mantel’s gaze is directed outwards. Her imagination in this novel is neither mirror nor lamp, but rather a piercing ray of light that makes the layers of shadow in the scenes she creates all the more pronounced and beguiling.Sarah WatersIt’s hard to pick a favourite Mantel novel. Not just because they’re all so good, but also because each is so distinct. She is one of those inspiring authors who has been fabulously unafraid of pushing her writing into new physical and literary landscapes.The landscape evoked by Eight Months on Ghazzah Street (1988) is that of 1980s Jeddah. Thirtysomething Frances Shore arrives to join her architect husband, and finds herself part of an expat community that has been lured to the city by the promise of swollen salaries. It’s a stultifying world, gossipy and casually racist – a world of sticking it out till pay-day by hosting jolly little dinner parties, by brewing bootleg wine in the bathroom, stocking up on gold at the souk ... Mantel’s fiction bristles with “difficult” women, and this novel features one of the best: much of the mordant humour comes from the fatally bad fit between Frances and the ghastly fellow Brits with whom she is obliged to socialise, as well as from her furious run‑ins with the misogyny, hypocrisy and Kafkaesque obfuscations of everyday Saudi life.Because the Jeddah of Eight Months is a nightmare of a city. Glutted with wealth, throttled by censorship, it’s a place of secrets, fear and disorientation, a place where even the physical terrain seems to shift and baffle, as brash new buildings spring up almost overnight. Frances, a cartographer by trade, has lost her bearings. But is she also, we begin to wonder, losing her mind? Jobless, stuck at home all day, unable to take a stroll on streets where unveiled women face continual harassment, she begins to obsess about the supposedly empty flat upstairs. She hears footsteps and muted sobbing, she glimpses figures in the hall. Is the flat, as local rumour has it, the trysting-place for a pair of illicit Saudi lovers? Or is something much more sinister going on? One of the delights of this novel is the way it speaks to a thrilling tradition of “woman in peril” stories, the footsteps overhead evoking Patrick Hamilton’s Gas Light, the apartment building’s decor – a mass of hideous tiles, each resembling a single bloody-eyed face in a rictus of pain – recalling the jaundiced walls of the bedroom-prison in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s The Yellow Wallpaper. Ultimately, however, as the disorientation expands, we realise that there are not just misogynies at work here: there are cultural myopias, competing models of freedom, competing versions of Islam.Or do we? I’ll be honest: I’ve read this book three times, and I’m still confused about what the hell’s going on. But that’s part of what takes me back to it. Creepy and claustrophobic, Eight Months on Ghazzah Street is a gothic masterpiece, and as with all great gothic texts, the reader has to forswear comfort, surrender confidence, become like Frances Shore herself – not sure, in fact. Not sure at all.Anne EnrightHilary Mantel sees things that other people do not see – and not just political undercurrents, secret ambitions or subtexts. In her memoir Giving Up the Ghost she is happy to discuss her experiences beyond the literal the fact that she has seen or sensed presences of one kind or another, including the ghost of her dead stepfather. This “flicker against the banister” is only one of the spirits mentioned on these pages there are also metaphorical demons and the devil incarnate, not to mention the ghostly forms of pennine sheep, by which she means real sheep, the kind that go “baa”.Mantel grew up in Hadfield, Derbyshire, a stony town so windswept she was 11 years old before she saw a real rose. Her family was part of a beached and declining Irish Catholic population of immigrant workers: her mother was a mill-girl, her grandmother did not have the luxury of knowing her own birthday. Mantel’s grandfather served in North Africa and her memory of him is thronged by the men who did not come home. At the age of four, she walked into school knowing how to load a machine-gun belt, and waiting for the moment she would become a boy. “My best days,” she writes of this moment, “were behind me.”The psychic rupture happens first in her parents’ marriage and then in herself with one piercing, childish thought: “I stop them from being happy.” She falls into repeated fevers, loses her thick hair, her robust about-to-be a boy body, and she turns into a child the local doctor calls “little Miss Neverwell”.At seven going on eight her (under-described) father yields his place in the marital bed to a man called Jack, and moves into his daughter’s bedroom. At around this time she sees in the back garden a nauseating “disturbance of the air”, a terrible absence that fills her with dread and then with itself, “a body inside my body, amphibian, budding and malign”. Not many writers could deliver this episode as fact, but to do otherwise, Mantel says would be to deny its phenomenological accuracy. This happened to her. It may be explained but not explained away.“This was the beginning of shame.” If you want to know why Mantel writes fiction, or indeed if you want to know why fiction is necessary, then the answers to both of these urgent questions can be found in Giving Up The Ghost.Sara CollinsIn the epigraph to her first published novel, Every Day Is Mother’s Day, Hilary Mantel quotes Pascal: “Two errors one, to take everything literally two, to take everything spiritually.” According to Mantel in an interview in 2009, this could well have been the epigraph for everything she’d ever written to that date. It would certainly have been an apt introduction to Beyond Black, her 2006 Orange-prize shortlisted novel, which aims to avoid both errors by intending very firmly to be taken both literally and spiritually. The result is a rare, almost hallucinatory reading pleasure.Actual ghosts circulate in the village halls where travelling medium Alison channels messages from the dead, striking only in their sheer banality: exhortations to get an eye exam, compliments on kitchen renovations. What feels like magic is carefully constructed by building up the minutiae of daily life (“A certain class of dead people was always talking about cardigans. The button off it, the pearl button …”). It’s what convinces the punters their dearly departed are really there, and it’s also how this novel pulls off the same trick: keeping the reader at once on the literal plane and the spiritual one.While the afterlife is mundane, the real world is re-cast as anarchic purgatory, with night closing in on its “perjured ministers and burnt out paedophiles …” Alison is also haunted by apparitions far more sinister than cardigan-hunting grannies, including her lecherous spirit guide Morris. Dark hints intrude, suggestions of a childhood in which he played some despicable part: a mother who prostituted her own under-aged daughter feral dogs with a taste for human flesh a disembodied head floating in the bath. This feels agonisingly literal, but we sense that Mantel intends these vulgar, rampaging demons to stand in also for dislodged fragments of memory, the novel reaching for metaphor to make its point, which is of course about the everyday world, not the spiritual one. We might, it suggests, be just as likely to find hell growing up in a rundown house in Aldershot as anywhere else.Yet even where its terrors are biblical in intensity they often also manage to be entertainingly absurd, marrying the ridiculous and the sublime, as when Princess Diana manifests, wearing her wedding dress. “Give my love to my boys!” she exclaims, and then: “Oh fuckerama! Whatever are they called?” It is an astonishing novel, with a spine-shivering gothic pulse. Part of the joy of rereading it, as with all of Mantel’s earlier work, lies in discovering the motifs that return again and again. Resurrecting Thomas Cromwell may have won her the Booker, twice, but Beyond Black is propelled by an awareness of text as a kind of transubstantiating material, a vehicle for bringing back the dead.Kate WilliamsA Place of Greater Safety, Mantel’s magum opus on the French Revolution, follows three young men from humble backgrounds, good lawyers, three times as intelligent as the men they serve. Maximilien Robespierre, Georges-Jacques Danton and Camille Desmoulins: provincial boys given a head start thanks to their preternatural intelligence, living in Paris, hauling themselves up through hard work, surrounded by a profligate and lazy aristocracy. They are, like everyone, at the mercy of whimsical, spendthrift monarchs, the king a “large, pious, conscientious boy”, the Queen wearing “diamonds like naked blades”, and a selfish aristocracy. Sound familiar? But, of course, unlike Thomas Cromwell, they don’t become the power behind the throne, they throw it all to the ground.Mantel has done her research, explored deep into the sources, as we know she always does. What the historical novel gives us beyond those facts is imaginative proximity. The historian cannot attribute motivation but the novelist must go deep into the head, find desire, faith, love and hatred – and in the characters of the French Revolution she does, to brilliant effect. Danton most of all is made real, a man of fear and hope, desire and equivocation. And she brings to life the ordinary people whom Marie Antoinette sees on her way to the scaffold, the glass-workers who down tools and stream out for revolution.The inner lives of women are often hidden from historians, but Mantel imagines them superbly. Most of all, Paris bursts from the page: the court, the exhausted milliners, the actors painting their faces every evening, the hard-drinking shoe-makers, the markets and factories and, as the city freezes and starves, “ships are impaled on the ice, with grain rotting in their holds”. These are the people who drove the revolution but are so often hidden from historians because they left so few traces. Mantel takes us into the ordinary houses and streets in which revolution was plotted, a new world was planned.

Thirty years ago it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat.”His remarks were condemned as Islamophobic and threatening community relations, in a week in which a far-right terrorist killed nine people in Germany.The Muslim Council of Britain said: “This is the very definition of Islamophobia. Institutional discrimination against Muslims is well-established: whether it is the ability to get a job, buy a flat or even getting car insurance. The challenges of flying while Muslim are well documented across the globe.”Tell Mama, which monitors anti-Muslim incidents in the UK, criticised O’Leary for “being discriminatory and basing judgments on the looks of people, which is abhorrent”. It also warned that his “flippant” statements could come back to haunt him by putting off customers.In the interview, O’Leary described airport security as “utterly useless”, accusing politicians of trying to give the impression they were doing something to protect the public. He also took aim at the need for wheelchair-friendly facilities, mocked transgender people – “I’m male today and I’ll be female tomorrow” – and criticised Greta Thunberg.The aviation magnate, who has compared himself to Jesus, is no stranger to controversy, appearing to revel in his reputation for being outspoken. He has described environmentalists as “lying wankers” and said: “The best thing you can do with environmentalists is shoot them.” He has expressed similar disdain for travel agents, saying: “Take the fuckers out and shoot them. What have they done for passengers over the years?”Customers and staff have also been subjected to foul-mouth tirades. O’Leary called passengers who failed to print out boarding passes “stupid” and said they should “bugger off”. He ridiculed the idea that staff were a business’s most important asset, saying: “We all employ some lazy bastards who need a kick up the backside, but no one can bring themselves to admit it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef31e1c66c439b968368182907c63c9805717a7/0_33_3999_2399/master/3999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a1e5c1cb371bf26bb5707893fe48694","title":"priti patel hostile environment","story":"It’s the home secretary’s trickiest week since her ‘holiday’ in Israel, but at least she’s visible. Where’s the prime minister?According to officials from one of her former departments, Priti Patel was given to coming out of her office and inquiring: “Why is everyone so fucking useless?” Very bold. This is a bit like Donald Trump coming out of his office and asking why everyone has spectacularly stupid hair. The perma-smirking Patel has now moved on to the Home Office, where this week she was accused of bullying staff, trying to oust her most senior official, and creating an “atmosphere of fear” within the department. As opposed to outside of it, which is the norm. If nothing else, it’s a failure of management. To get the best out of people who you want to do their worst, you need to create the right working environment. It’s why the offices of S.P.E.C.T.R.E have a great creche, a smoothie bar, and two “I don’t feel like killing” days per annum for every employee.As for the Home Office, a complex department already regarded as malevolent, it is now in the hands of someone who recently gave an interview in which she repeatedly confused “counter-terrorism” with “terrorism”. This whole “Priti Patel is home secretary” scenario has the flavour of one of those US news stories where some open-carry idiot’s toddler has leant forward in their car seat and pulled a gun out of the backseat pocket. If you’re one of those people who get off on saying “I told you so”, then fine. But really, there are no good outcomes here. One of the more eye-catching Home Office briefings against her this week declared that Patel was “not committed to the rule of law”. Given she’s home secretary, that feels akin to a doctor not being committed to the idea of medicine. Should it not be vaguely disqualifying?Arguably, then, it’s been the trickiest week for Priti since the one when she went on a private family holiday to Israel with her husband and then-nine-year-old son, and met with … hang on, we’re going to need a colon here because there’s rather a lot of this: prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a senior foreign ministry diplomat, the public security minister, the leader of the Yesh Atid party, at least nine NGO leaders, staff at a hospital, two charity bosses … There are several more, but all you need to know is that this was your classic holiday-with-kids. “Can we go to a waterpark?” “No. Mummy needs some me-time in the Golan Heights.”I’m only kidding – presumably the husband did the childcare while Priti relaxed on a lounger at the Knesset. Or maybe everyone was included, with the grownups playing it all as an elaborate fib, like when you try to persuade your children that something grim is a fun game. “You said we were going to have an ice-cream.” “I know but I’ve got something even better – it’s Benjamin Netanyahu!” (I mean … we’ve all met some ghastly people on holiday, haven’t we, but that’s got to be pushing it.)Despite being resigned from office after that little jolly, Priti Patel is now home secretary, a yin whose yang is the statement, “Dominic Raab is now foreign secretary”. And in keeping with the ironicidal themes of the Boris Johnson administration, it this week fell to madam to front the government’s new policy barring unskilled workers from coming to the UK.Patel insisted those jobs previously filled by immigrant workers would be stepped up to by Britons currently classed as “economically inactive” – a rationale that means so much more coming from someone always classed as intellectually inactive. One theory is that last Thursday’s cabinet reshuffle brought bad news from Priti’s magic mirror, which no longer gave the desired answer when she inquired of it: “Who is the dimmest of them all?” So this week has been all about restoring herself to her rightful throne.Either way, Dominic Cummings will doubtless enjoy the torrent of briefing against Patel, because it plays into his narrative that the sole brake on this government’s genius is the civil service. Cummings has made so much of his intention to revolutionise “the blob” that the only reading that flatters him assumes that he wishes to do quite the opposite. Otherwise, why play it like he has? If you talk to people who have genuinely revolutionised any established institution, the absolute first thing they will tell you is that you never, ever do it by announcing that plan when you arrive. If you do, you set up resistance and defensiveness from the start.So has our beanie-hatted strategist cocked this battle up before it was even fought? You’ve heard of Sun Tzu – meet his brother, Shi-Tzu. Of course, I’m being unfair, because you can’t fault Cummings on the old election-winning. But it increasingly feels like his plan to remake the state could end up commuted down to shifting the location of some lobby journalist briefings and firing a few spads. As physicist Murray Gell-Mann once remarked: BIG WOWS. The question is not if but when the Cummings flounce-out happens. A big fan of interdisciplinary enlightenment, I know he’d be stimulated to learn it was exactly the same with Geri and the Spice Girls. It doesn’t take a superforecaster to see that Dominic will sooner or later be a superblogger again.And so to the impossibly brief tenure of superforecaster Andrew Sabisky. Cummings’s first hire after his appeal for “weirdos and misfits” to work in No 10 ended up with the apparently unvetted Sabisky flaming out on Monday. When Cummings left his house for work the next day, he was accosted by a journalist shouting laconically: “Have you got any more weirdos?” This is definitely my favourite doorstep inquiry since Michael Crick greeted Peter Mandelson one morning with the salutation: “Will you be telling any lies today, Mr Mandelson?”But let’s get real here for a minute and ask: how weird was Cummings’s weirdo, really? When Classique Dom put out his famous APB, I was envisaging someone like the brilliant non-binary quantitative analyst in Billions, an unconventional genius with a fascinating and mysterious backstory. Instead, the very first “weirdo” Cummings went for was some basic Oxbridge thinktank twat, at least 436 of which can be found wanking on the wrong side of the velvet rope at the Spectator party at Tory conference. Yes, he’s a dreary little eugenicist bro. But aren’t they all, dear.Still, on the show goes. Indeed, speaking of the economically inactive, whatever happened to the prime minister? One hears so little about Boris Johnson these days, and sees him even less. His career refusal to even pretend to give a shit has been noticed by some in the worst flood-hit communities, who are more likely to be visited by Elvis than Boris.According to briefings, the PM spent much of the week holed up in Chevening, the Kent country house normally at the disposal of the foreign secretary. It seems Chequers is being renovated, so Johnson must have commandeered the next grace-and-favour property down. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pleased for the Chevening locals. I don’t think any of us would wish to meet Raab on a remote country lane. And perhaps this is how the PM means to conduct his premiership – with the odd mad appearance on the battlements, but in general concealed from public view like some Victorian liability. It’s a living, I suppose. But is it a life?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4fdb9926d03b7e2d0ffb72e714a7dc85a3aaa10/0_375_4533_2720/master/4533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f1933136556e68c75423299b33b990","title":"airbnb model housing sharing","story":"Like many Californian startups, there was something utopian about Airbnb’s founding vision. What if trustworthy travel didn’t have to mean big, corporate hotel brands? In 2003, couchsurfing had pioneered online homestays, using the web to share profiles and reviews to give people confidence that strangers could just be “friends you hadn’t met yet”.At first, it seemed like it was doing good – the whole “sharing economy” did. Consumerism and ownership were over experiences and rental the sustainable future. Neither Gebbia nor Chesky “wanted to ‘create more stuff that ends up in landfill’,” Chesky told the  in 2012. “The idea of creating a website based on renting something that was already in existence was perfect.”But behind the Californian hippie language lies the “California ideology”: a libertarian gospel of anti-statism and free markets. Airbnb wanted as much of the short-term lettings market it could get, spamming Craigslist users to get them to switch, and not checking up too closely on who exactly was hosting (comprehensive listing verification was only introduced in 2019). As Wired reported last week, “Airbnb empires are being rapidly scaled and monetised, with professional operators creating scores of fake accounts, fake listings and fake reviews.”Increasingly, it appears that Airbnb hosts aren’t ordinary people renting out a spare room, but profiteering landlords and rent-to-rent chancers leasing entire apartment blocks. Travellers report being let down by dodgy accommodations and a cheap, identikit “Airspace” aesthetic. Local people are being displaced from their neighbourhoods.The sharing economy also does something more insidious: it transforms everything in our lives into an asset, viewed in terms of its financial potential. Does my home really need a living room or could I Airbnb it for £50 a night? Do I really need a weekend or could I do some extra work on Fiverr or Deliveroo? It financialises our souls.And yet, 13 years after Airbnb’s founding, I believe our cities and villages still need more sharing, not less.We need many and varied housing structures and funding models (rental and ownership) to help us find homes that fit across our lifetimes. Long-term, that means imagining a new architecture of flexible, reorganisable living structures – but in the short term we need ways to rearrange people in the housing we already have. Easy, affordable ways for people to move for a few weeks’ work or training, or for empty-nesters to share their newly empty space. Ways for people to split the cost of housing when they need to cover a gap, without necessarily being locked into year-long arrangements. Ways for towns and cities to accommodate seasonal spikes in festival visitors without turning themselves into a hotel-room ghost town the rest of the year. Hostels and lodger schemes are certainly great, but they aren’t enough.Long live that side of Airbnb. But let’s regulate the hell out of the rest.• Jay Owens is a researcher and writer interested in media, technology and modernity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a85145148c874aeeaeb0dd0f0fb3f343b2dae1d/0_1_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b73d16e05d8d559d28da68656d861eb7","title":"streaming with laughter the 50 best standup comedy shows","story":"From Bill Hicks to Hannah Gadsby, Dave Chappelle to Josie Long – here are 50 specials you can watch right nowby  Paul Fleckney, Harriet Gibsone,  Ellen E Jones,  Brian Logan and  Graeme VirtueOh, how you spoil us, the internet. Watching a comedian’s latest show used to involve waiting for one of about eight comics to release a VHSDVD or, gulp, leaving the house. Today, we hold the whip hand. Such is our desire to sit around watching standup in our pyjamas, streaming services can’t get them out fast enough. Netflix is our most deep-pocketed and reliable dealer, pumping out no less than 45 original shows in 2019, up from one in 2012. But there are other providers, notably Amazon Prime Video, iPlayer, and smaller outfits such as NextUp and Go Faster Stripe, which do a fine job of mopping up lesser-known comics and hidden gems.To the bean-counters at Netflix et al, the appeal of these “specials” is obvious: they are cheap to make compared with sitcoms and films, but they still attract a lot of eyeballs. And to the ambitious comic, it can mean the difference between national and international success. This has led to little outbreaks of creativity here and there, as comedians embrace the format’s increasing dominance. Maria Bamford’s decision to record her show The Special Special Special! in a living room, in front of an audience of just two (her baffled but supportive parents), was inspired and in keeping with her unorthodox act. In his BBC series Comedy Vehicle, Stewart Lee literally spoke down to the audience at home through a camera at the side of the stage. The streaming services are starting to experiment now, too, with shorter, snackable shows of just 15 to 30 minutes, as a way of showcasing rising stars. All of which means that the humble TV viewer might require some help to hack through this jungle of options. So, in that spirit, we have put together 50 of the best standup specials you can find online. PFBaby Cobra didn’t just give us Ali Wong, she of the death stare and the dead-on observations it also created a sub-genre of special: the heavily pregnant ones.

GVTeen musical comedy prodigy-turned-standup superstar, at 25 Burnham made Make Happy: casually brilliant, abundant in smarts, cynicism and aggressive misdirection, and fraught by his tortured self-hyperawareness.

All you gotta do is wait for it to get kind of quiet and then go: ‘Eww.’” EEJOne of comedy’s most uncomfortable watches broadcasts from his home town of Bisbee, Arizona, with off-colour, orthodoxy-baiting material on global poverty, mental health and beheading videos. Often brilliant, often hard to stomach. Best bit: “Isis is using social media to recruit disenfranchised, angry youth. And that’s what I do! That’s my demographic!” BLIt’s still the highest-grossing standup film of all time, but Murphy has admitted parts of his 1987 special now make him cringe. The homophobic slurs have certainly dated, although Raw’s Cosby mockery seems prescient. And the purple leather outfit? Timeless. Best bit: Murphy’s impression of his stepfather angrily misremembering Motown lyrics must be appreciated in full. EEJThe best musical comedians in the world toured in 2018 with this blissfully entertaining show, stuffed with old favourites, beautifully wrought newbies and deadpan banter.

Best bit: “You just never know how love will end  But never ever introduce her to your handsomest friend” from the song Father and Son. BLThis is the hour that brought a small-town Tasmanian global recognition. Others deconstruct the form, do biting satire or emotional vulnerability, but few combine all three. Plus there is something here that none of those “Kings of Comedy” could muster: Gadsby’s invaluable perspective. Best bit: “I may as well come out now … I identify as tired.” EEJBuress became notorious in 2014 after his Bill Cosby routine reignited legal interest in the sex pest. This 2016 special touches briefly on that fallout but mostly explores the Chicago standup’s appealingly languid interests. Best bit: “I don’t have fuck-you money, I’ve got strongly-worded-email money.” GVGood luck working out what’s going on when Teeuwen takes to the stage.

Minhaj’s earnest optimism might be American, but his reach is truly global. Best bit: “There are over 10,000 apps for mental health. That fact alone gives me anxiety.” EEJIgnore that earnest title, the broad from Broad City isn’t about to bend your ear on climate change. Instead, it’s the same twerk-tastic, sexually confident energy we’ve come to love in her TV alter ego, with added Hebrew school anecdotes. Best bit: “The Amazon is on fire and my special is on Amazon …and it is fiiiiire.” EEJA suite of four standup shows, bringing TV viewers up to date with his live career. Recognise, Represent and Reset are as they were originally intended: tall tales of being an undercover cop, a juror and a criminal mastermind-turned-snitch, respectively.

I said to my parents: ‘Let’s not stop now … how about a hearing aid?’” GVLike a Simpsons approximation of a standup brought to life: classical in style, family-friendly and a toothy grin.

BLThe usually enthusiastic comic is in a contemplative mood here: recovering from a big breakup, obsessed with outdoor swimming, and able to deliver a seemingly innocuous story about her sister’s wedding with an emotional sledgehammer of a punchline. An 80-minute softening of the soul we can all benefit from. Best bit: A surprisingly touching anecdote about her ex responding to period blood. HGJoan Rivers (RIP) has many successors but Ryan, all Botox and badass takedowns, must be her truest heir.

Best bit: The “No, those are next year’s daffodils come early!” gag about a warming world. BLThe San-Franciscan sitcom pioneer has been effortlessly upending racist and sexist stereotypes for decades, and has picked up several starry showbiz anecdotes along the way.

We’re sort of like blondes, but no one thinks we’re stupid.” EEJAs if Bamford’s standup wasn’t twisted enough, this 2012 set is filmed in her living room, to an audience of just two people – her mum and dad. Bamford pulls no punches for them, in a claustrophobically intense hour on God, mental health and existential despair.Best bit: “My mom is very religious, and she said: ‘Whatever you think about all the time, that’s what you worship.’ If that’s the case, I’d like everyone to pop open their Diet Coke cans and turn to page 37 of their People magazines.” BLA documentarycomedy show in which Thomas reports back from the frontline of an increasingly privatised NHS, with stories of shadowing staff and interviews with bigwigs. The power of his oratory and his love for the subject makes it an affecting watch. Best bit: The 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony reveal. PFMost female standups have feminist material, but Wolf and her distinctive voice never let up, including extended musings on menstruation, childbirth and abortion.

Why do I fucking care? But I do.” EEJThe prolific standup’s 2016 debut special sees him bellyaching about Wagamama, Gogglebox and his poor old mum, but crucially the most lacerating observations are about himself. Best bit: “Christmas is difficult at my house because I can’t pretend to be Santa.” Pause. “Because I have a lazy eye.” GVShe’s less overtly shocking these days, and perhaps the better for it.

Here’s what some of you saidThere are beautiful signs of spring popping up in the grounds of the hospice where I work. It’s hard not to have mixed emotions: it is beautiful, especially bathed in bright winter sunshine, but knowing it’s only early February means we could just as quickly have deep snow next week. The life that’s appearing feels all the more fragile at this time of year and in turn it’s a reminder of the crisis our planet is facing.The photo of flowers above was taken this year on a ‘path of life’ at St Gemma’s hospice in Leeds on 6 February. The path is a place where anyone can come to reflect and remember. The wintry photo is from a similar time last year on 1 February when there was snow on the ground. Looking at the two they look like completely different seasons. In early February last year our gardening team were out clearing snow off the paths, whereas this year there’s barely been a hint of it. Natalie Clince, digital marketing manager, Leeds With the warmer weather our rhubarb is growing strong – which is a concern if we have frost later. Our rhubarb is organic and has been in the garden since we bought the house over 30 years ago. This year they seem to be appearing incredibly early. The daffodils are just coming up now too. I was in shock at how early they were and how beautiful and vibrant the colours are against the starkness of winter. Clare Howarth, 54, designer, from ManchesterSerra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal, reaching 1,993 metres above the sea. Back in the late 80s and early 90s it was very common to see snow at this time of year. Lately it is rare a snowfall will last more than a couple of days, except at the top. It’s actually becoming more common to watch the fruit trees blossoming earlier. The above photo was taken on 5 February this year, a very warm day of about 20C, and shows an almond tree in bloom – something that usually happens in early March. The below photo was taken in February 2013 at the same location but showing the surroundings on a snowy day. Isabel Garcia, 35, PortugalMy partner and I are passionate hill walkers, hikers and in general outdoorsy people, so there’s plenty of room to compare. It’s been an incredibly warm winter this year and we’ve barely noticed the snowcaps on the hills in Lomond and Trossachs national park. Last year we were not able to take the road over the hills from Aberfoyle due to ice and snow today it was completely clear and not a sign of snow. We found these flowers during a walk in February this year around Loch Katrine, near the southern slopes of Primrose Hill. It’s a stark contrast compared to last winter here in Scotland when we went over snow of 10-15 centimetres for many kilometres – bloom was completely out of question. Martynas Virzintas, 39, hospitality manager, from Glasgow Spring is starting to burst out all over. The snowdrops have appeared and opened fully within a few days which is a little puzzling as they seem to have done so more rapidly than usual. Rather strangely, most of the flowers are coming out at the same time, even though they are normally staggered between late January through until April. Often the UK winter is persistently dull and grey – but not this year. David Seedhouse, author, Wolverly, West MidlandsI am chair of an environment scrutiny commission looking at ways we can reduce our carbon emissions in Southwark. I live in the middle of the city on the river and took the below photo in Southwark park, one of the oldest in London. I have noticed that spring is coming earlier and earlier each year. Snowdrops, prunus, narcissus and iris are not usually fully out but they are in full vigour right now. Blossom does make dreary places look beautiful and at the moment the scents of spring are greeting us before the end of winter. Leanne Werner, Labour councillor in Southwark, LondonMount Fuji is visible most days from the training ring where I work as a horse groom. Locals say that usually at this time of year the whole mountain is white. Last year there was more snow in January and February, whereas this year Fuji-san is only half covered in snow. You can see this from the photo I took on 3 January this year. Even though it was last year, when I arrived in Japan on 21 March, I noticed the sakura (cherry blossom) bloomed four days later when normally this doesn’t happen until April.

Women keep getting raped by designers, by us.”Speaking as he presented his Emporio Armani line at Milan fashion week, he said: “If a lady walks on the street and sees an ad with a woman with her boobs and arse in plain sight and she wants to be like that too, that’s a way of raping her,” Armani said. “You can rape a woman in many ways, either by throwing her in the basement or by suggesting that she dresses in a certain way.”The designer, known for his sober, elegant outfits, founded his label in 1975 and has built it into a global brand. “In my show, there are short skirts, long skirts, ample and tight trousers. I have given maximum freedom to women who can use all possibilities if they are sensible,” he said.“I’m sick of hearing the word ‘trend’. We need to try to work for today’s woman. There shouldn’t be trends,” he added.The designer stayed loyal to his simple and neutral looks in his autumnwinter 2020 Emporio Armani show, keeping silhouettes loose and straight-lined with a new emphasis on recycled materials.At the beginning, black dominated the catwalk, then it was the turn of shades of green and blue, because “shops need colours to catch customers’ eye,” as Armani remarked.Models wore lace-trimmed shorts, opaque tights and wide-legged trousers. Dressed were ruffled and cinched at the waist with belts or combined velvet and silk. Jackets, long and flowing or cropped and buttoned, were combined with tiny halter-neck tops. Footwear mainly consisted of laced up boots, and bags and clutches were small. Velvet, a recurring material, was also used in accessories.“The Emporio Armani woman is strong-willed, eclectic and bold in her decisions. With little regard for mundane rules, she is a young woman that bewilders and astonishes,” show notes read.Armani will present the autumnwinter 2020 collection for his main Giorgio Armani line on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d9f25e18dccc0ee7db538909440f8b79a6350a/0_242_6096_3658/master/6096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29db262274262ce2a3661b7116707965","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury sopranos actors testimony annabella sciorra","story":"Jury indicated that in three counts they have reached their decision, and will now break and return to deliberations on the other two counts on MondayThe jury at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial in New York appears to have reached a verdict on three of the five counts facing him, though they are deadlocked on the most serious charge – predatory sexual assault.Shortly after the lunch break on Friday, the seven men and five women of the jury were called back into court having indicated that in three counts they have reached their decision. These are: the count that alleges the fallen movie mogul forced oral sex on a then Project Runway production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and two counts of rape in 2013 of a woman who the  is not naming as her intentions on identification are unclear.However, the jury also made clear that they cannot reach a unanimous decision on counts one andor three. Those predatory sexual assault counts involve sex crimes against more than one woman, and carry the stiffest sentence of all, amounting to at least 10 years in prison and possibly life.After a nail-biting few minutes in court 99 of the New York supreme court, in which an imminent verdict appeared possible, the judge, James Burke, in consultation with prosecutors and Weinstein’s defense team, told the jury to keep on going. Weinstein’s lawyers had said they would accept a partial verdict, but prosecutors said no and Burke refused to do so. Burke then said with a little more work the jury could reach unanimity on those counts too. The jury will now pick up its deliberations on Monday.The jury’s problems with the predatory sexual assault counts are in tune with their requests over the past two days. They have been focused on Annabella Sciorra, the former Sopranos actor.She testified in the trial that Weinstein, 67, brutally raped her some time during the winter of 1993 to 1994 in her Gramercy Park apartment in Manhattan. The alleged incident occurred so long ago it is beyond the statute of limitations and cannot be prosecuted in its own right.Sciorra is, though, included in the predatory sexual assault charges in addition to Haley and the unnamed alleged rape victim.The fourth day of deliberations began on Friday with a re-reading of large chunks of Sciorra’s testimony, at the jury’s request.Before going home the day before, the Manhattan jury had sent the judge a note that said it wanted to review the cross-examination of the Sopranos actor and any follow-up questioning by prosecutors. About 90 minutes into the reading, the jurors notified the judge they had “heard enough” and resumed their deliberations. The jury has already focused on emails that Weinstein sent regarding Sciorra, including ones to the private Israeli spy agency he allegedly enlisted to dig up dirt on would-be accusers as reporters were working on stories about allegations against him in 2017.Sciorra, now 59, was the first accuser to testify and took the witness stand nearly a month ago, telling jurors how the once-powerful movie mogul showed up unexpectedly at the door of her Manhattan apartment before barging in and raping and forcibly performing oral sex on her.On cross-examination, Sciorra was grilled about why she opened her door in the first place and didn’t find a way to escape if she was under attack.Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno asked: “Why didn’t you try to run out of the apartment? Did you scratch him? Try to poke him in the eyes?”“He was too big” to fight off, Sciorra responded at one point. “He was frightening.”• In the US, Rainn offers support at 800-656-4673 or by chat at Rainn.org.

Then, everything changed.I spent Friday nights watching Friends, I listened to NWA on my Sony Walkman, wore tie-dye T-shirts and drank ‘thick shakes’. Crucially, when it came to biscuits, crisp was most definitely out and big, soft and chewy cookies were in. They made quite the impression and, if I’m honest, never really left – I am still a cookie-lover, so I thought it about time I wrote a recipe for this American classic.Put the flour, baking powder, bicarb, salt and sugar in a large bowl and mix well.

We make many efforts to erge and expand, of course, but it’s safe to say that feta has made its mark on many of my past recipes. Today, it gets star billing.I’ve recently been keeping a jar of this in my fridge, and find myself returning to it for breakfast (on toast with sliced avocado), supper (over baked potato with egg and chopped salad) or for a sneaky, pre-bed snack (with a glass of wine). It will keep in a sealed container in the fridge for up to a week.10 garlic cloves, peeled1-2 lemons – zest finely shaved into 8 strips, and juiced, to get 1½ tbsp4 bay leaves2½ tsp chipotle chilli flakes1½ tsp paprika250ml olive oil1 tsp flaked sea salt2 blocks Greek feta (360g), cut into 2cm cubesPut a small saute pan on a medium-high heat. Once very hot, add the garlic and cook for about three to four minutes, turning halfway, until charred on the outside. Add the lemon and bay leaves, cook for 90 seconds more, then add the chipotle and cook, stirring continuously, for about 30 seconds, until well toasted and fragrant. Off the heat, stir in the paprika, oil and salt, then leave to cool completely.Once the mix is cold, stir through the feta, then transfer to a bowl or glass jar and leave to marinate, at room temperature if you plan to eat it within the next couple of hours, or refrigerated (and covered) if you’re having it later. If you do refrigerate it, take the feta out of the fridge about an hour or so before you want to serve it, for the oil to come back up to room temperature.Just before serving, stir in the lemon juice.I love the combination of sweet and salty in a cheesy context. It’s a welcome assault on the tastebuds, and truly wakes you up. This is why this dish in particular is good served for a late breakfast or brunch, with eggs, bacon if you like, and a green salad alongside. It’s super rich, so one piece is more than enough, if you have it as part of a brunch spread.2 blocks Greek feta (360g), each cut into four triangles (ie, 8 triangles in all)35g rice flour (you could use plain flour instead, if you’re not gluten free)1 large egg, well beaten100g mixed black and white sesame seeds, lightly toasted2 tbsp olive oil½ tbsp picked lemon thyme, or regular thyme For the syrup120g runny honey1 tsp ground black lime (optional) 3 lemons 1 juiced, to get 1 tbsp, the others left wholeLine a shallow, 30cm x 20cm baking dish (or baking tray with a slight lip) with greaseproof paper.Pat dry the feta, then dip each piece in the flour, gently shaking off any excess. Coat the cheese triangles first in the beaten egg and then the sesame seeds, making sure they are completely coated. Transfer each piece to a lined tray and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or for up to eight hours if you want to get ahead).Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465Fgas 9. Drizzle the oil over the feta and bake from cold for 18 minutes, very gently flipping the pieces once halfway, or until golden and warmed through.While the feta is baking, put the honey and black lime (if using) in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once the mix starts to bubble, turn the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, for about six to seven minutes, until it turns a deep amber caramel. Off the heat, stir in lemon juice until incorporated and smooth, then leave to cool slightly for about five minutes.Meanwhile, use a small, sharp knife to trim the tops and tails off the remaining two lemons. Cut down around their curves, removing the skin and white pith. Release the inidual lemon segments by slicing between the membranes, then stir these into the cooled honey mixture.Pour the lemon syrup directly over the feta in the baking dish, scatter over the thyme and serve at once straight from the dish.This is loosely based on the Middle Eastern red pepper dip muhamarra. The addition of feta makes it creamy and more complex, and I amplify this even further with chopped fresh lemon and olive salsa. It’s delightfully not for the faint-hearted.

On a freezing December night in Liège, midway through his stint as Arsenal’s interim head coach, he opted to solve a personnel shortage by selecting Bukayo Saka, a gifted but seemingly raw wide forward, at left wing-back. Saka excelled in a dour performance that picked up when he delivered brilliantly for Alexandre Lacazette to score. Moments later the 18-year-old curled a marvellous equaliser and, at the time, such pearls of quality felt as much a rebuke to his manager as proof he had adapted seamlessly.“He was a bit upset with me because he had to play wing-back and full-back, and he doesn’t like it so much,” Ljungberg said, not that he looked remotely repentant. “But he’s a tremendous talent. His final ball is always effective and there’s always an end product to his work.”A dozen appearances later, Saka is yet to return to his preferred – events have ensured one hesitates to say natural – position. Arsenal were not supposed to lack left-back options after signing Kieran Tierney from Celtic, and with Sead Kolasinac capable of foraging a tramline up and down that flank. But Tierney has been hampered by injury and three days after Saka’s display in Belgium Kolasinac pulled up against Manchester City. Ljungberg could have shuffled things around but decided Saka had shown enough nous to come straight on at left-back. The next week Mikel Arteta watched him complete 90 minutes there in a generally awful draw at Everton and Saka, who had experienced the position fleetingly with England Under-18s, has been impossible to dislodge ever since.He seems certain to face Everton again on Sunday and his progress since that first encounter has, by any measure, been astonishing. Whether he likes it or not, Saka appears made for left-back and the figures are stacking up. The low centre that brought Lacazette’s winner at Olympiakos was his ninth assist of the season and his fifth in the Europa League. None of his teammates, nor his peers in the European competition, have achieved anything comparable. Five of those contributions have come since his deployment in the nominally more defensive role, the most memorable bringing an outrageous nutmeg of Valentino Lazaro before teeing up Nicolas Pépé in the demolition of Newcastle.Saka’s rare quality is that every action bursts with purpose and information. Little is wasted and that is something Arteta, keen for Arsenal’s improvement to be light on frills for now, values highly. Ljungberg’s comment about end product was not simply a rhapsody in the post-match glow: the clarity Saka shows in the final third, so acute for a player who turned 18 in September, arises constantly in conversation with anyone who has dealt with him during his journey through the ranks.These are, Saka might protest, essential qualities in a winger but it is easy to see why Arteta might consider a longer-term conversion. He has largely played down the idea so far but that Arsène Wenger made successful winger-cum-defenders of Ashley Cole, Gaël Clichy and Kieran Gibbs will not be lost on the head coach. Arguably, none of them possessed Saka’s power or decisive streak at this age and it helps that things have gone well defensively too. Saka is tough in one-on-ones, knows when to snap into tackles and – another theme his coaches relish – is desperate to learn. “He’s always asking questions, meeting with my assistants and wanting to improve,” Arteta said. One possible weakness, which Olympiakos almost exposed, lurks in his awareness when defending the back post but issues of that kind can be smoothed with time.So are Arsenal blessed with their next world-class full-back or is a major conundrum in the post? It is not fanciful to suggest that were an England squad picked on current form Saka and Leicester’s Ben Chilwell would be its left-backs. He could find himself an international player in his new role by accident but his talent as a winger, evidenced in the way he dismantled Eintracht Frankfurt in September, suggests he would eventually achieve the same via his favoured route too.After the Newcastle game he said he could not see himself becoming a left-back permanently. “I feel like my dream was always to be a winger, to affect games, score goals and get assists. For now I’ll do the job the manager asks me to do.”He is ticking those boxes already but Saka, an intelligent inidual who achieved As or A*s in all his GCSEs, will know he has only one career. There are already rumblings about his contract, a relatively meagre package that expires next summer and will need improving upon quickly.Champions League clubs risk complicating the situation for Arsenal if the Gunners do not qualify and Saka will hope to discover the plan for more specific aspects of his longer-term development, too.How to make the best of him is one of the happiest, but also among the riskiest, calls Arteta will have to make over the coming months it is also one that those who raised eyebrows when handed the lineups in Liège could hardly have seen coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f8f976f3aea170195e23bdb385481e1e615bbfa/0_250_5069_3041/master/5069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=573137d17d524606a81b56804d748c25","title":"chelsea v tottenham premier league live","story":"47 min: James has a wander down the right and has a dig from distance. He drags his shot across the face of goal. Lloris had it covered.Spurs get the second half underway. Mystic Dom doesn’t have much confidence in their ability to turn this around. “Is there any more chilling sentence to a Spurs fan than ‘If Spurs win this game, they will \u0026ltinsert very positive outcome here\u0026gt’? To be honest, I don’t know why Jose bothered to send a team out.”Half-time entertainment. Max Rushden celebrates the legendary Jimmy Greaves, whose brilliance is one of the few things Chelsea and Spurs fans can agree on.It’s not been much of a spectacle, though Chelsea won’t care. As things stand, they’ll go four points clear of Spurs in fourth, thanks to Olivier Giroud’s expertly taken goal. The best you can say for Tottenham: they’re still in it.45 min: As this half peters out painfully, the officials show us some mercy. There will be just one additional minute. 44 min: Might as well beat the queue for a pint and a pie.42 min: It’s not been a classic so far, this.40 min: Lo Celso is barged - fairly - off the ball by Kovacic, allowing Chelsea to break upfield at speed. Barkley breaks into the box from the left and shanks wide. He should have done much better.38 min: Chelsea reestablish some control in midfield. But that was much better from Spurs, who are finally showing a little ambition.36 min: Alderweireld, quarterbacking from deep, sprays a pass down the right for Tanganga, who comes in from the flank and takes one touch to bring Alonso out of the game. The ball also flies past Caballero, who is way off his line. But it’s flying at speed, and bobbles out of play to the left of goal before Tanganga can poke into an empty net. Nearly as direct as it gets.35 min: Spurs finally show in attack. A few passes and Moura is gifted space in the box on the left. His shot is deflected over the bar by Azpilicueta’s lunge. From the corner, Sanchez flashes a header towards the top left, but it’s tipped over spectacularly by Caballero. The second corner comes to nothing.33 min: Kovacic slides a ball down the middle. Barkley takes up possession, his back to goal 30 yards out, and very nearly backheels Mount free down the inside left. Sanchez blocks. Spurs were very nearly opened up with a rapier thrust.31 min: Giroud has a dig from the best part of 30 yards. Ambitious, bordering on downright disrespectful. An international team-mate of Lloris as well.29 min: Lo Celso gets up and takes the resulting free kick. It’s not very good. 28 min: Lo Celso dribbles down the left and is clattered by Mount. He extends his leg as he falls, and catches the Chelsea player. It’s not exactly Harry Maguire on Michy Batshuayi, but it is a little bit saucy. Neither referee nor VAR is interested, though.26 min: Spurs haven’t responded to falling behind at all. They’re barely able to string two passes together. Chelsea are enjoying the lion’s share of possession.24 min: The set piece is worked towards Alonso, to the left of the D. He chests down and pearls a stunning volley towards the top right. It’s beaten Lloris and is inches away from nestling in the top corner. That was Le Tissieresque.23 min: But here comes the first yellow card of the afternoon. Winks loses control and is robbed by Jorginho. He responds by tugging on the Chelsea midfielder’s shirt, and that’s a booking and a free kick out on the right.21 min: Giroud and Sanchez clatter into each other. No whistle, and no recriminations either, the pair shaking hands after a short period of hopping around in pain. Adults playing hard but fair.19 min: Jorginho tries to release Barkley down the inside left, but Sanchez snuffs out the attack. Chelsea are first to everything in the centre of the park right now.17 min: VAR pokes its neb in. Of course it does. But there’s nothing wrong with the goal, and eventually we’re allowed to continue. The Stamford Bridge faithful break into a chorus of the traditional English folk song Fuck VAR. No manners, but cogent analysis nonetheless.Jorginho curls a glorious pass down the inside right channel for Giroud. A poor first touch takes him a bit wider than he’d like, but he powers a shot towards the bottom right anyway. Lloris parries. Barkley gets onto the rebound and slams a shot against the right-hand post. Giroud latches onto that rebound and drives home, beating Lloris, the ball flying into the bottom right.14 min: Barkley powers his way down the inside right and fires a low diagonal shot wide of the left-hand post. A more-than-decent effort.13 min: Seems Giroud’s header took a nick off a Spurs player. Another corner. James hits it long. Too long. Goal kick. Ah well, at least this match has finally sparked into life after a slow start.12 min: Chelsea respond by whisking up the other end, Alonso sliding a glorious pass down the inside left to release Mount, who whistles a shot towards the bottom left. Lloris turns the ball around the post. From the resulting corner, Giroud flashes a header wide left at the near post.10 min: The first corner leads immediately to the second. Lo Celso’s low delivery is cleared by the first man, but Spurs come back quickly at the home side, Moura dropping a shoulder 20 yards out and slamming a shot towards the bottom left. It’s a fine effort, but well met by Cabellero.9 min: Bergwijn busies himself out on the left, and earns the first corner of the game off Azpilicueta.7 min: Rudiger dallies in the midfield and is robbed by Winks, who should really send Moura clear down the left. But his pass is a clunker, and flies out for a goal kick. Shame for Spurs, as Chelsea were light at the back there, and Moura had plenty of grass in front of him.6 min: A slow, scrappy start to this game, which is why I’ve been droning on about bugger all.4 min: Spurs have hardly had a touch yet. Maybe they’re pining for the yellow winter ball, which is back in its box for another year, replaced by a white-and-red number. Spring has sprung.2 min: Alonso crosses from the left. James crosses from the right. Spurs clear without too much fuss. It’s all Chelsea in the opening exchanges, Spurs happy to sit back.And we’re off! Chelsea get the ball rolling, and ping it around the back for a bit.The teams are out! Chelsea wear their famous blue, Spurs are in their trademark lilywhite. A derby-day atmosphere at Stamford Bridge. We’re one reggae instrumental away from kick-off.And now it’s the turn of Frank Lampard. “It’s a big moment for us. We understand how close the battle for fourth is, and it’s a big rivalry anyway. This game always has a lot on it, regardless. Our players need to show something, our home form hasn’t been what we want it to be, we are very honest about that. It’s a time to change that, a good opportunity. Olivier Giroud’s professionalism has been brilliant. He needed some weeks to get fit, and today he is ready, so he gets the nod. We have a squad for a reason, players have to come in and do their jobs. I expected Jose to know how we were going to go, so the match-up is a test, a challenge for us.”BT Sport have a word with the ever-spiky Jose Mourinho. “I cannot demand more than I do in every game, which is to give everything they can give. We have had only two days to prepare but we prepared the best we could. As I was more than expecting, Chelsea come with a system and with Alonso playing, we prepare ourselves tactically for that. And with what we have available, we are going to fight for the points.” As for leaving out Dele Alli? “I am not sure you ask every manager in the Premier League when one player stays out. Do you do the same question for them? For other managers it is normal to leave out any player they want. It looks like to me any time I make a decision of this type, there is always a big story so I prefer not to answer. I think Ndombele can give us creativity, we need a bit of risk, he is in condition to give us a good hour.”Chelsea hand Olivier Giroud his first start in three months. He’s one of four changes to the side that went down at home to Manchester United. Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and Marcos Alonso also step up, taking the places of Michy Batshuayi, Pedro, Willian, and the injured N’Golo Kante.Meanwhile there’s no room in the starting XI for Tottenham’s bottle-and-boot-juggling malcontent Dele Alli. He drops to the bench, one of three changes made in the wake of the Leipzig defeat. Serge Aurier and Gedson Fernandes also make way Jan Vertonghen, Tanguy Ndombele and Japhet Tanganga take their places.It’s fair to say Chelsea have the upper hand in this fixture: Tottenham Hotspur have won it once in the last 30 years. Look at it another way, though: Spurs have won one of their last two Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge, having triumphed here 3-1 in April 2018. So depending on your cut-off point, and the angle at which you’re holding the prism you’re peering through, Spurs either have a win ratio of 50 percent or a slightly less impressive 3.33 percent. It’s all up to you.However you want to spin it, this is a big one. When Chelsea did a number on Spurs in north London last December, an eventual finish in the Champions League places looked likely for Frank Lampard’s side. For Spurs, such an end-of-season prize seemed a pipe dream. But Spurs have won three of their last four league games, drawing the other, while Chelsea are without a win in four. And suddenly, having made up eight points in short order, Jose Mourinho is breathing down his old club’s neck. They’re just a point behind!Should Chelsea swat Spurs aside as they usually do on their own patch, that gap regenerates to four points and the Pensioners can breathe again. Only problem is, they’ve won just five of their 13 league matches at the Bridge this season. Spurs will scent blood. Chelsea, however, have that recent 2-0 win in N17 as succour, and can point to Tottenham riding their luck at times during their recent winning run, while they themselves had none whatsoever against Manchester United last Monday. So depending on how you look at it, etc., and so on, and so forth.Can Chelsea burst clear again in the race for fourth? Or will Jose overhaul his old club to set up one hell of a scramble during the run-in? We’ll find out this lunchtime. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7be2e79ee86ae2ffe866327f4fb635aeb0205e/338_454_5278_3167/master/5278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b19c9154b08e02eb0b06566986151afa","title":"tell us have you moved across europe for love","story":"If you have moved across Europe to pursue romance we would like to hear from you.

What did a box of letters and photographs reveal about the sacrifice she made?When my grandmother died I did not go to her funeral. I was 16 at the time, so it wasn’t that I was too young. Instead, the agreed family line was that I was too sick, in between hospital stays for anorexia. But even if I’d been in the rudest of health I wouldn’t have gone. All my life, I’d avoided my grandmother – why would that change now that she’d died?Of course I loved my Grandma Sala, but I enjoyed her a lot more in theory than in practice. I loved how beautiful she was, and that she was French having a French grandparent, albeit one who lived in Miami, seemed incredibly exotic when I was growing up in New York. She told me to call her grande-mère, and you’d better believe that I dropped that into conversation with friends at any opportunity, along with references to how “chic” she was, another word I learned from her.And she was chic, incredibly so. While other Jewish grandmothers in Miami wore shapeless shift dresses and garish prints, my grandmother always looked as if she was on her way to a fashion show, even when she was going to the supermarket. Her American husband, my Grandpa Bill, dressed the part of a true Floridian, in his white trousers and pastel golf shirts, and he would sit with us by the pool, letting my sister and I twirl his handlebar moustache. My grandmother, however, would sit alone – under an umbrella, separate from us, reading the French fashion magazines her brothers still sent her from Paris. She wore distinctly French styles – Yves Saint Laurent-like peasant tops, Chanel-esque jackets, mini Dior handbag in her lap. She looked as French as my grandfather looked American, the soft, elegant looks of a Renoir painting, but overlaid with the melancholy of an Edward Hopper.Bill and Sala were my paternal grandparents and although I loved them both, they did not seem to love one another, or so it appeared to me as a child. When we visited them, they snapped at one another continuously, which scared me because I never saw my parents fight. I loved to talk about my grandmother when she wasn’t there – but when she was, I fled. She would hold me just that bit too close, looking at me as if she was asking for something I knew I could never give. I squirmed away from a love that felt oppressive, because, for reasons I was in no way capable of articulating then, I found my grandmother difficult. If pressed, I would have said that she was “weird” but what I meant was that she seemed sad, and sad adults are confusing for children, especially ones as sheltered as I was.I have one memory of her running away from me. When I was five, my parents took me to Europe for the first time. We went to Deauville, a seaside town in Normandy, to meet my French family – Sala’s family, in other words. I knew that my grandmother had left France a long time ago to escape what was vaguely described to me as “the war”, before marrying my grandfather in New York. But I hadn’t, until we went to Deauville, ever thought about what she’d left behind. On the first night, we arranged to meet everyone in the hotel dining room: my grandmother’s older brothers, Henri Glass and Alex Maguy, and Henri’s wife, Sonia. Sala flew over from Miami to join us, but that first night she was late. As I waited with my parents and this trio of impossibly old French people, I spotted my grandmother in the doorway, hanging back, watching us. Then I noticed something else: she was crying. She turned around and rushed out of the room.“What’s wrong with Grandma?” I asked my mother, but she shook her head and put her finger to her lips. I looked to my father. He was looking towards where his mother had disappeared, before going after her.It was a lovely holiday. Alex Maguy – whose surname was “Glass”, like Henri’s and Sala’s, though he went by Maguy professionally – made the biggest impression: this namedropping art dealer, full of fire and fury, but always gentle with me. Sonia, who looked like a firecracker with her red hair and blue eye shadow, taught me how to play bridge and introduced me to pain au chocolat. Gentle, kind Henri couldn’t speak English, so we would just nod and smile shyly at each other across the table. And then there was Sala, clinging on to Henri’s arm, growing quieter as the week went on.Afterwards, I went back to New York and everyone I met in Deauville slowly, inexorably died. Sala died in 1994 and although she had made a life for herself in America, she never stopped seeming sad to me, and her sadness never stopped unnerving me. I never let her get close, and to this day there is a cold part of me that recoils from neediness. For years afterwards, thinking about all this made me feel things I couldn’t articulate. Again, I probably would have said it made me feel weird, when what I really meant was that it made me feel terrible. So I deliberately didn’t think about it at all.As I got older, I spent some time with Alex, the last surviving Glass sibling. I’d have lunch with him in his flat, surrounded by his collection of paintings by Monet and Matisse and Picasso, and I’d never question why his supremely glamorous life in Paris was so different from my grandmother’s in Miami. But after he died in 1999, when I was 21, I suddenly couldn’t stop thinking about that and more. I knew there was a story about what had happened to the Glasses during and after the war, but even thinking about it felt like touching a bruise. I started alternately tapping this tender spot, and running away in horror at what I was doing. I spent whatever free time I had in archives in France, Poland and New York, and then hid my notebooks around my flat, kidding myself that I wasn’t doing what I was, in fact, doing.In 2006, when I was working on the ’s fashion desk, I came up with what seemed like a painless way to write about my grandmother: I would write about her relationship with fashion, and how, despite living in the US for almost 60 years, she had used her clothes to emphasise her un-Americanness.My uncle Rich, my father’s younger brother, was living in my grandparents’ former apartment, and fortunately for me, he had kept most of her things. So I flew to Miami, intending to go through my grandmother’s closet and describe her wardrobe, using it as a way to write about her, because writing about her without any proxy still felt too much like staring into the sun. I opened her closet and started to go through her belongings. At the back, I spotted a shoebox, covered in more than a decade’s worth of dust. I was sure it would contain another pair of battered kitten-heeled sandals but, determined to be thorough, I pulled it out. It did not contain sandals. Instead, inside were the secrets my grandmother had kept all her life. They included:A small album featuring photos of Alex, Henri and Sala, younger than I’d ever seen them before. There were also photos of Sala embracing a man whose face had been gouged out by someone’s – presumably my grandmother’s – fingernailPhotos of a man I’d never seen before with round spectacles. In some photos he was with a group of other men, standing in or next to a cabinA letter in French saying that “la famille Glass” was hiding in Paris under an assumed nameLetters between the Glasses ning over half a centuryPhotos of Alex Maguy with Pablo PicassoA sketch of a man holding a gun to his head that was signed, “Avec amitié, Picasso.”For the next 13 years, I followed these clues, often feeling like Casaubon in Middlemarch, the silly fool who embarks on an impossible book project that he never finishes. Originally I planned to write just about my grandmother, not her brothers, but it quickly became clear that this was impossible: their lives were completely entwined. Also, Alex, Henri and the third brother, Jacques – the man in the round glasses whom I had never met – each had extraordinary and strikingly different stories, and I couldn’t let them fade away, like old photos in the back of a closet.I learned that Henri invented a machine that microfilmed and shrunk down documents, and that during the war he had travelled in secret all over France with his machine, saving public and private archives from Vichy and Nazi forces. After the war, Henri’s microfilms helped to rebuild towns and ports. Multiple times, he was nearly arrested and saved only by the fake ID card Sonia got for him on the black market, which said he was a Catholic named Henri Classe. After the war, this machine would make him enormously wealthy. Sonia, who stayed hidden in Paris during the war, was in even worse danger although her German was good, it’s not easy for a firecracker to stay in the shadows. She moved out of her and Henri’s apartment in central Paris and rented one under a false name by the Bois de Vincennes. But her former neighbours frequently pinned denunciation letters to her door, attempting to turn her in to the Gestapo. Sonia would rip them off and, in one case, posted a note to my grandmother in the US, to let her know what was happening.Jacques, the brother I never met, was arrested in 1942 and sent to Pithiviers, a French concentration camp. He also posted my grandmother memorabilia to keep her updated, in this case, photos of himself and his fellow prisoners. Incredibly, he was allowed out for a day to visit his newborn daughter. Henri and Alex met him by his wife’s bed and begged him to go into hiding, saying they would help him. But Jacques refused, because he had given his word to the prison guards. So he went back and soon after was shipped out – on the same train as Irène Némirovsky, author of Suite Française – to Auschwitz, where he was killed.By far the most time-consuming brother to research was Alex. The files on him, which were scattered across France in various archives, were so fat they took me years to go through. Originally a couturier, whose closest friend in the business was Christian Dior, Alex joined the Foreign Legion as soon as war was declared, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his bravery in combat. But when France fell to the Germans, he was arrested and put on a train to the camps – which he escaped by climbing out through the roof and jumping off. Alex spent the rest of the war hiding in a farmhouse in central France – which I eventually found – while working for the resistance. Afterwards, he switched careers from fashion to art and was a celebrated gallerist in Paris. Picasso drew the poster for one of his most important exhibitions and the two men became close friends, initially because the artist so admired Alex’s wartime record.Henri, Jacques and Alex led lives of masculine adventure, which were recorded in official archives. My grandmother, on the other hand, spent the war as a housewife in Long Island. She represented the quiet feminine: domestic, private – what George Eliot described as “a hidden life”, one of “unrecorded acts”, filled not with adventure but emotional drama, and that is not something I would find in an archive. Instead, I needed to talk to those who knew her best, and that meant her sons – my father Ronald, and my uncle Rich. I dreaded hurting them by asking difficult questions, but it turned out that what had hurt them most was feeling they had to keep these stories to themselves. Slowly, Sala’s life, one she’d always kept in the shadows, came into focus.Despite seeming like the embodiment of Frenchness to me, Sala and her brothers weren’t French at all they were Polish. They were born and raised in Chrzanów, then famous for its large market place, but better known today for being only 20km from Auschwitz, so close that the towns considered themselves to be sisters. In 1918, the pogroms began and the Glass family fled to Paris, to join their cousins, the Ornsteins. These pogroms terrified the Glasses but ultimately saved their lives, because any Jew who was still in Chrzanów at the beginning of the second world war was killed.The siblings fell in love with Paris: its beauty, its sense of style and, of course, its safety, which was to prove all too transitory. Henri and Sala made themselves over to be as French as possible, and with the enthusiasm of converts, lost their Polish accents and dressed in the most Parisian of clothes, which Alex made for them.All of them worked in the fashion business – or “schmatte” trade, to use the Yiddish term. Fashion – like the movie industry today – was then considered a Jewish industry, specifically a Jewish immigrant industry. Partly this was a practical issue: in contrast to many other professions at the time, there were no quota limits on how many Jews could work in it. On a more emotional level, fashion (like art, another profession that was then heavily Jewish) is an industry that celebrates beauty. It is not surprising that Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who had experienced so much ugliness in their lives, might crave a corrective. Alex and Jacques ran a tailoring shop in the Marais, the then Jewish quarter in Paris, and Sala, a talented artist, made patterns for mass-produced clothing: swirling, psychedelic drawings filled with colour, excitement and happiness. At 25, she was independent, living in a city she loved, with a family she adored, and was engaged to a young man – a dentist and socialist – with whom she was deeply in love. And then in February 1937, it was all taken away from her.One night, Alex brought an American man over to Sala’s apartment for dinner. He was, Alex told her, a millionaire from Manhattan. Suddenly over dinner, the American man, who had been staring at Sala since he arrived, reached across the table and told her he’d fallen in love with her at first sight. Marry me, he begged, come with me to America. Sala laughed this off, but after the American left, Alex – who closely followed what was happening in Germany – told her she had to do it, because staying in Paris was a death sentence. This guy was rich and a good friend, Alex said she’d never get a better offer. To Sala’s horror, Henri agreed, and so, in what must have been a state of shock, in June 1937, Sala sailed to New York, to marry a man she didn’t know, leaving behind everything she loved. When she arrived and her beaming husband-to-be drove her to her new home, she realised some things pretty quickly: this man was not a millionaire, he did not live in Manhattan, and he did not work in the fashion business. He didn’t even really know Alex. He ran a gas station out on Long Island and he just happened to meet Alex one day while on holiday in France. Alex, banking on my grandmother’s beauty to woo this man, had then lied to her in the hope of getting her out of Europe. This is how my grandparents met.My grandfather Bill loved Sala very deeply, and would do so for the rest of his life. But while she appreciated him as a good man and a good husband, she didn’t love him the same way, and this hurt him. She was miserable in his small town and complained often, to his astonishment. Hadn’t he saved her from the Nazis? She was a lot less grateful than he’d expected. She was no longer making the art she loved instead, she was a housewife and dependent on a man she barely knew. The fights started soon after they married. She was all alone in this strange place, and once the war started, she spent years not knowing whether her family was alive or dead.By the end of the war, she was the mother of two sons. There was no way she could survive as a single mother in Paris, a city emotionally and economically destroyed by the war. So she resolved to wait until Bill died, when she could return to France. The grandmother I met 40 years later was someone who was still waiting for her life to begin.Sala endured a specifically female tragedy: she gave up her true love, her dreams and professional fulfilment for protection by marriage with someone she did not love. Alex got a medal for going to war, but no one was going to give her plaudits for what she did. On the contrary, this kind of self-sacrifice was so expected of women that, in the eyes of those around her, it would have been extraordinary if she had refused to do it.The story of my grandmother confused people, especially Jewish Americans, who understandably assume that any story about escaping the war to the US is a happy one. But inidual lives are more complicated than great sweeps of history, and while Sala was alone and frustrated in America, Alex and Henri went on to live gloriously successful lives in France. Sala had done what she had to in order to survive, but in saving herself she lost everything that had made her life worth living. Other things took their place – her children, eventually her grandchildren – and she was demonstratively affectionate to them, naturally loving, but also desperate to justify to herself the path her life had taken. If she loved them enough, if they loved her enough, then maybe it would have been worth it. This is the need I sensed in her as a child, but was too young to understand.Sala never saw her former fiance again he almost certainly died in the war. She also never lived in France again. Thwarting his wife to the very end, Bill lived into his 90s, and just as he started to decline, Sala had a massive stroke that stilled both her body and her tongue. At Bill’s funeral, people remarked on how affecting it was to see her in her wheelchair, crying silently as she looked at her husband’s coffin. But she wasn’t sad that Bill had died. She was sad that the day she had waited for had finally come, and it didn’t matter any more. All those fantasies of living in Paris, of travelling to Israel: all gone. Two years later, she died in a US hospital, far from the place she still thought of as home, 60 years after leaving it.Once the Glass siblings died, my extended family drifted apart. None of us were good at staying in touch, and we’d all got the same message from the Glasses: that the past should be pushed away and not discussed. So didn’t that include our own families? But as perhaps Jews know better than most, you can never entirely escape your past.Once I finally started to slough off the anorexia that had blanketed my teens and 20s, I realised there was some kernel in me, one that I could neither explain nor understand, that meant I wanted to work in fashion. Like the Glasses I, too, wanted to see beauty.After finishing university, I lived in Paris and started working as a freelance fashion journalist. This eventually translated into the job on the ’s fashion desk, where I was to stay for eight years. One of my favourite parts of the job was covering the shows and one day, when I was at the Dior show in Paris, I felt a hand on my shoulder.“Aren’t you my cousin?” asked a handsome man. It was Alexandre de Betak, Henri and Sonia’s grandson. He worked then – and still does – as a fashion show producer, collaborating with brands such as Calvin Klein and Yves Saint Laurent. But probably his most enduring relationship has been with Dior, whose shows he has worked on for years, just as Alex Maguy’s strongest relationship in France was with Dior himself. Neither De Betak nor I knew of this connection until I started researching this book.Soon after that, I met another cousin, Philippe Ornstein, the grandson of one of the Glasses’ cousins, Maurice Ornstein, who was killed in the war. Philippe and I also found each other through fashion: he was then working as a fashion publicist, and when we met it felt as if we had grown up together.For decades, I ran away from this story, researching it with my right hand and fearfully covering my eyes with my left. I told myself that it was self-indulgent to write my family history – who would be interested in reading about Grandma? But the truth is, I just found it too painful to leave alone, picking at it like a scab. Even before I knew the details of Sala’s story, I’ve always known that I would not exist if the Holocaust hadn’t happened – because then Sala would never have come to America. For a long time, this added another dimension to my well-established sense of Jewish guilt: that I was alive only because of the suffering of other people, and one person in particular – my grandmother. But Sala would not have seen it that way. In her eyes, we were not the compensation for what she had left behind but the explanation for it. I had avoided her sadness when she was alive, but two decades after her death it still felt so palpable to me that my research took up an entire bookshelf – and still, I couldn’t bear to write the story. Then in January 2018, I sat down and did just that.But my obsession with this story had little to do with political prescience on my part. Instead, it was because of the people involved, each one such an extraordinary force of personality that I couldn’t shake them off decades after they died.Sala had longed to move back to Europe, to be with her family, to have lunches in Paris with them, to go to the fashion shows, to live the life of her choosing. She never got to do that – but I do. Because she gave up everything, I get to live her dream. I think of her every time I walk along the Boulevard Saint-Germain when meeting one of my cousins for lunch in the Marais when I go to a fashion show. I think of all the Glasses every time my train pulls into the Gare du Nord – how they arrived in Paris from Poland by train a century ago, knowing no one and owning less. How far they went in their lives how politics and fate tore them apart. And I think of how we all came back together, in the end.• House Of Glass by Hadley Freeman is published by Harper Collins (£16.99).

But when I come downstairs the next morning, I am surprised to see a large bouquet of flowers in a vase on the kitchen table, and another on the windowsill.“I got you roses,” my wife says.“You did?” I say. “Thank you.”“White,” she says. “For cowardice.”I make no reply. Eventually, my wife stops cackling.“Made myself laugh,” she says.“What are your plans for today?” I say.“I’m going to that big garden centre,” she says. “What about you?” I think about this for a moment.“I’m coming with you,” I say. She thinks about this for a moment.“I’ll allow it,” she says.A few hours later we arrive back home with a bunch of plants, but it’s not gardening weather. My wife retreats to bed with a book, and I go off to my office shed to pretend to work. An hour slips by, then another. The rain pours down outside.When I return to the kitchen at sunset, I find the oldest one and youngest one making risotto. To the untrained eye this might look like a charming domestic scene. To me, it’s like watching two monkeys assemble a catapult. I blink a few times, in wonder.“Since when do you make risotto?” I say.“Since always,” says the youngest.“I’m surprised you’re not more interested in risotto,” says the oldest.“It’s actually very easy,” says the youngest.“I know how to make risotto, thanks,” I say, wincing, because I don’t really like saying the word risotto.“And it’s way better than Spicey Ricey,” the oldest one says. He is referring to our traditional Sunday night supper of leftovers tinged red with paprika.“I’m not sure what you mean,” I say.“Spicey Ricey is not very nicey,” says the youngest, ladling stock into the pan.“Spicey Ricey basically is risotto,” I say.“No it isn’t,” says the oldest. “You can’t make risotto with regular rice.”“Listen to yourselves,” I say.The next day everyone eats lunch together, at an hour arrived at through tireless compromise.“If it’s chicken for Sunday lunch, you know what that means for supper,” my wife says.“Please not Spicey Ricey,” says the youngest.“Why don’t we just have risotto?” says the oldest.“If you want to make it, fine,” my wife says.“Fine, we will,” says the youngest.In the afternoon the weather clears up enough for me to attempt to replace a crumbling section of trellis with a new section I bought the day before. I’m frustrated to discover, after a complete search of the house, that I only own one nail.“It’s ridiculous,” I say, walking into the kitchen. “I used to have sacks of nails.”“What are we talking about?” says the oldest one as he chops a celery stalk.“In the end, I had to pull the bent, rusty nails out of the old wood, and hammer them straight,” I say.“Where is our Stilton?” says the youngest.“We don’t have any,” I say.“Or any soft, blue-veined cheese,” he says.“What for?” I say.“For the risotto,” he says.“You can’t put blue cheese in risotto!” I say.“We’re cooking, not you,” says the oldest. “Please don’t do this,” I say.“Get out,” says the youngest.An hour later my wife is staring doubtfully into a pan of risotto.“Am I allowed to eat it in front of the telly?” she says.“Of course,” says the oldest. My wife and I take our bowls and sit down in the next room. The other two stay in the kitchen with their laptops.“It’s delicious,” she says.“Actually, it is,” I say.“Are you going to tell them?” she says. I put my feet up on the low table in front of me, either side of yet another vase of white roses.“Eventually,” I say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f2508b0c8e668df53357e4b840fc4570c51586d/0_862_5232_3138/master/5232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9602b274fe27f0707194ff10b784f18","title":"i didnt become a competitive swimmer for money","story":"Former GB Paralympic swimmer Liz Johnson on her varied career and the importance of staying independentName: Liz JohnsonAge: 34Income: £22,000-£45,000 from earnings and personal independence payment (PIP)Occupation: Former GB Paralympic swimmer, speaker, broadcaster, managing director of The Ability PeopleI didn’t become a competitive swimmer for the money. The first National Lottery funding I received when I was 15 was £184 a month. At its peak it reached £2,000. Your income varies depending on performance – if you aren’t world number one or don’t break a world record, you could literally go from being in the top bracket to zero in a year.But that didn’t matter – I loved swimming. I joined the Dragons swimming group when I was eight and by the time I was 13 I was competing for Great Britain.I was fortunate that my swimming journey coincided with a focus on the Paralympics. I competed internationally and won three medals for 100m breaststroke: silver at Athens in 2004, gold at Beijing in 2008, and bronze at London 2012.An injury meant I was forced to retire from international swimming in 2016. But the stars aligned because, at the same time, I was offered the chance to join Channel 4’s broadcasting team for the Paralympics in Rio.Now my earnings come from broadcast work, corporate speaking, consultancy and athlete mentoring. As a freelancer, money is sporadic and fluctuates. My income ranges from between £22,000 to £42,000 a year. Additionally, I receive a personal independence payment (PIP) of about £300 a month.In 2018 I founded The Ability People, a disability recruitment consultancy. We work with organisations to help them become more inclusive. This can range from testing their application process to redesigning their office building. My team is paid but I haven’t taken anything directly, though I’m hoping I can take a sum out this year.I spend about £50 a week on petrol for my mobility car. It enables me to be independent. I can’t carry shopping and, because of the way my cerebral palsy affects the whole of my right side, I can’t utilise a wheelchair effectively. I wouldn’t be able to work, get anything I need, stay fit or do any activities if I didn’t have a car.I spend about £400 a month on flights. My partner is a Brazilian international swimmer and we split our time between there and the UK. I’m really fortunate that swimming has enabled us to see each other regularly. I give myself a budget of £4,000 a year for travelling. I try to visit one new country every year.I do spend a lot on clothes and their maintenance. I often spill stuff and it never comes out, or I fall and tear them. I used to think I was careless, but it’s just the way I move. I have to buy two pairs of shoes at a time as I wear a splint on my right foot, so I need different sizes. I spend £500 a year on gym membership. I know I could get a cheaper one, but it’s the service as a whole I need. I rely on the community within the gym – they know me well and make everything comfortable. Membership and physio costs are excessive, but essential to maintain my mobility.I don’t live on a shoestring but I’m not frivolous. I always make sure I have a financial buffer – firstly, because I’m freelance and, secondly, because I don’t have anyone else to rely on. My partner is financially non-existent in the UK – yes, he could transfer money, but in terms of borrowing, it’s just me, and I have a younger sister who needs me.I never save for anything specific but I continually save. So when we decided to book our wedding in Brazil for later in the year, I had money in the bank. My parents taught me how to look after money. My finance degree has also helped. When I was 19, I received both lottery funding and a student loan, so I put down a deposit on a house in Swansea. After my mum died, I used my inheritance to help buy a house in Bath, where I was training. I now own four properties: in Swansea in Newport, where I live in Manchester and one in the Valleys. I don’t always make money – I sometimes think I’m a generous landlord – but ultimately everyone needs a bit of a break. I don’t have a pension, so I see them as enabling me financially when I retire.As told to Suzanne Bearne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7712c100e2c47d9685d8d0f948ef5c36e1d1f812/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c3e4a46ab4d2484bafd7c8b4ce783e2","title":"nixon in china scottish opera review theatre royal glasgow john adams","story":"Theatre Royal, GlasgowThe seismic 1972 meeting of Mao Zedong and Richard Nixon, as depicted in John Adams’s inspired 1987 opera, still resonates in Scottish Opera’s potent new stagingAsk a Chinese person, or one trusted to speak to tourists, about the current status of Mao Zedong – founder of the People’s Republic of China, proponent of the disastrous Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution – and you get a dusty answer. Dead more than 40 years, his popularity waxing in some quarters, Chairman Mao still dominates Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. His mausoleum has queues. His face gazes down, godlike, at the entrance to the Forbidden City.Most of China was forbidden when the US president, Richard Nixon, and his foreign policy adviser, Henry Kissinger, travelled there in 1972. They met Mao, elderly and ill, and his premier, Chou En-lai, only slightly younger and fitter. By any standards, this meeting of east and west fascinates. To make an opera out of it, as John Adams and the poet Alice Goodman did in 1987, with the director Peter Sellars, was inspired: an explosive moment in global history compressed into three hours of lyrical drama. Nixon in China was first seen at Houston Grand Opera. Its UK premiere took place at the Edinburgh international festival a year later. Sellars’s Houston production morphed into stagings at English National Opera in 2000 and the New York Met in 2011.Fulljames and designer Dick Bird and their team have updated the action to a nonspecific present. We are witnesses to an archive, piled floor to ceiling with brown boxes, the mythologising of Mao laid out before us, image by image, by white-gloved curators and administrators. The embalmed Mao is wheeled past in his glass cooler, to emphasise the vantage point: we’re sifting through history. Storage screens slide back and forth as required, creating a fluid space for the action. A projected backdrop shows documentary imagery, including some later unlikely pairings: Reagan and Gorbachev, Trump and Kim Jong-un and, raising a noisy laugh, Johnson and Sturgeon. Fulljames still manages a modest coup at the arrival of Air Force One, even if not quite achieving the lofty spectacle of Sellars’s original.Initially, Carneiro took a ponderous tempo, orchestra and chorus slow to warm up to the punchy energies of Adams in minimalist mode – and, whatever its reputation, Nixon in China has a far more erse and subtle palette, embracing saxophone-heavy big band, moody dance music and prolonged, Wagnerian resolution. Adams’s rhythmic ingenuity in setting Goodman’s text, in all its variety, is a topic in itself. As the performers’ confidence grew, so that first uncertainty vanished. The sound was enhanced by a subtle amplification system (by German specialists d\u0026ampb audiotechnik), its first use in a UK opera. By the time Greene, in his Scottish Opera debut and brilliantly cast as Nixon, launched into his propulsive, media-addicted “News” aria (“it’s prime time in the USA”), all was well.As Mao, in his few appearances, Mark Le Brocq masterfully conveyed a sense both of charisma and folly. David Stout’s Kissinger, awkward boffin, has little opportunity to show his inquisitive powers: “Please, where’s the toilet?” is one of his more memorable lines. The dancers in the violent, revolutionary ballet The Red Detachment of Women, the three secretaries to Mao (Louise Callinan, Sioned Gwen Davies, Emma Carrington), the “chorus of Nixon in China” and the orchestra of Scottish Opera all combined to make this a gripping and absorbing show.Yet the lyrical moments, the private reflections especially of Pat Nixon and of the philosophically inclined Chou En-lai – elegantly sung by Nicholas Lester – stood out. “How much of what we did was good?” Chou asks at the end, contemplating lonely old age. And Richard Nixon, complex, ambiguous, so soon to be brought down by Watergate, has his own, all-American memories: “I found the smell of burgers on the grill made grown men cry.” Never the twain shall meet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26948d7871199b75462363f91f11e14304c06491/0_0_3500_2349/master/3500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8926ceeb67ddf68dabd8cff1af76498 700w","title":"what i learned from doorstepping dominic cummings","story":"What are the rules for waiting outside the PM’s adviser’s house? And does it serve any purpose?Things came to a head on Dominic Cummings’s doorstep on 11 February. “The night-time is the right time to fight crime,” he told waiting reporters, before going on to recommend PJ Masks for jobs in the cabinet. PJ Masks are children’s TV characters. The question had been about HS2. Pressed for more detail, the “maverick” replied: “I can’t think of a rhyme.”It was no more or less sophisticated than the two fingers it represented meaningless and silly, it was intended, one assumes, to put the journalists in their place. “I have not authorised this conversation, therefore this conversation is null, void, a string of noises disguised as words.”You can actually – I believe – track his thought process. Some days before, a reporter from ITV caught Cummings exiting a restaurant, just as the UK exited the EU. He asked a series of admittedly banal questions: “How do you plan to bring the country back together?” “You’ve worked so hard to this moment, does the real work begin now?” And Cummings’s reply, couched in irritable hectoring, like a horrible headteacher, was: “Are you going to walk along asking inane questions? Is that your best move?” Since then, he has been studiedly inane in his interactions. “Two can play at that game,” must be his reasoning, though an eager public awaits his 10,000-word blog on the subject.So is doorstepping Cummings a fruitful exercise, if these are its ground rules? Or does it merely underscore his immense power, the absolute carelessness for reputation and respectability it has brought with it, and fill the airwaves with the swill of his disregard? Are these journalists just making us all depressed, or are they performing the valuable service of holding him to account? They certainly think the latter.None of these reporters or camera people wanted to be identified or quoted, which I understood. You’ll just have to accept that they said what I say they did. I realise this is unfamiliar in a low-trust environment, but there it is.They’re not there every day – on Monday 17, it was just me, hiding behind a tree. On Tuesday, the pack arrives, though there aren’t as many of them as you might suppose: one solitary photographer, a camera person with a producer, and a journalist whose pay grade this gig is unfathomably below. To be standing outside a big-boned north London house at 7.20 in the morning, this person’s crusade must, on some level, be personal: a battle against the unaccountability of modern politics everywhere. Someone should definitely write a novel about him. “This is the second most important man in the country,” the journalist – let’s call them the Crusader – says. “But where do we get to question him? When does he appear in parliament to explain himself?”The photographer attached to him is a freelancer, working constantly, for newspapers and news agencies, five years out of university, in what I suggest might be his dream job. “Well, yes, until you have to start doing it. I just hope he comes out before the parking starts.”The TV team, producer and camera person are pooling their clips, so these will eventually go out on Sky and ITV, too, even though they’re from the BBC. The story on Tuesday was the resignation of Andrew Sabisky, forced to stand aside following the unearthing of racist, misogynistic and eugenicist remarks.The conversation on the doorstep while we waited was wide-ranging and interesting: we discussed other eugenicists of note (Jeffrey Epstein, apparently) the nature of UK politics now, which has become very stage-managed – pre-briefings and briefings, information fed to one or two preselected journalists – and a declining, almost moribund, tradition of finding things out for yourself by going to a place and asking a human being.A black cab lurks 20 metres away with its engine off. At about 7.50am, it creeps towards the house. Two minutes after that, Cleo Watson pegs up the street and jumps into it. “You’re late today,” the BBC producer says. “It’s recess,” she replies briskly. “The world is still turning,” says the Crusader. “She’s Cummings’s Spad,” the cameraperson says and everyone laughs – it’s a grim procedural joke, since advisers don’t get their own advisers, like Russian dolls – except in, you know, authoritarian regimes.The cab rigmarole leaves little room for error – Cummings is plainly coming out any minute – but we’ve reckoned without the bin man. “If you were outside my house, I throw a bucket of water over you.” “What have you got to hide?” I asked, and he said: “Nothing. It’s just incredibly annoying,” and splashed me with bin juice, though in a lighthearted way. “It’s not a very nice thing to do to somebody,” the photographer had already volunteered. Somewhere in the morality of the doorstep is a reality about politics this is something you would only do in a time of low transparency and high conflict. So that’s what it reveals. The words themselves, not so much.Cummings comes out of the side door, with a diffident gait but grumpy, chin-out face. The Crusader asks neutrally whether he regrets the Sabisky appointment. The BBC producer asks whether he’s a fan of eugenics, then: “Have you got any more weirdos?” This is a reference to the famous job ad that yielded the candidate in the first place. It is to the last question that Cummings mumbles an answer, which ends “… instead of political pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about”. He jumps in the cab with Watson and we watch it back on the pavement. I can make out the words superforecasters, but we all conclude that what came before was gibberish. By the time it appears on Sky, two hours later, is perfectly audible: “Read Philip Tetlock’s superforecasters, instead of political pundits who don’t know what they’re talking about.”Has this reference to a favoured political scientist added to our understanding of the Downing Street machine? It is, after all, still gibberish, even when you can hear it. Sabisky isn’t a superforecaster, he’s a half-baked incel who can’t even be bothered to read the science behind the poisonous new world order he espoused (tldr: eugenics doesn’t work on humans. Only apples, sometimes horses). Have we held Cummings to account? What would that even look like, bar his resignation? Would the discourse be any less rich if this moment hadn’t happened? We may not have known for certain that Cummings thinks he and his ilk have superpowers and the rest of us don’t know anything, but we probably could have guessed.And yet I find I have a new respect for the principle. He holds a huge amount of power, and accepts none of the responsibilities of transparency, persuasion and, actually, courtesy that go along with that. To see this and ignore it fosters a sense of impotence, even nihilism. When there are no longer people prepared to wait outside his house at 7am, we’ll really be in trouble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/340a71bc868112300fdcae893832d99e07d0f222/0_186_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91cb3d29722d8b6ce48777ffee98fa9b","title":"blue brexit passports issued redesign eu","story":"Redesign proves as isive as EU referendum, with one former MP calling it ‘ignorant’Blue passports will be issued for the first time in almost three decades from next month to mark Britain’s departure from the EU, the government has announced.They will replace the standard-issue burgundy passports that were rolled out across EU countries from 1988.The home secretary, Priti Patel, welcomed the switch back to blue, but pro-European campaigners and nationalist politicians in Northern Ireland predicted the new passports would result in Britons entering the slow lane at airports and ports throughout the EU.The Home Office says the blue passport will be “the greenest British passport ever”. A spokesperson said: “The carbon footprint produced through manufacture will be reduced to net zero, through projects such as planting trees.” It is also promoting the passport as the most technologically advanced. The spokesperson said there was “a raft of new and updated security features, including a hard-wearing, super-strength polycarbonate data page, which contains innovative technologies embedded into the document, to keep personal data secure”.The new-look passport incorporates the latest and most secure printing and design techniques, the spokesperson said, which would offer better protection against identity theft and fraud.Patel said: “Leaving the European Union gave us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path in the world. By returning to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one.”The home secretary’s enthusiasm was not shared by the European Movement. Edward McMillan-Scott, the group’s patron and an MEP for 30 years, said the blue passport would be seen as offensive to many Europeans.“It will be seen as a symbol of the attitude prevailing in the Conservative party towards the rest of Europe that is isolationist, ignorant and self-destructive,” he said.He said: “When I was an MEP, I remember being given a special blue pass that was meant to make it easier for me to pass through border checks on my way to Brussels and Strasbourg. It was more hassle than it was worth because some border officials weren’t sure what the document was and we got held up with endless checks.“So I threw it away and started using my normal burgundy-coloured UK passport – the same colour as everyone else passing through the EU. Without doubt this marking out of British passport holders by having another colour will make life uncomfortable, especially for the millions travelling to the EU.”Claire Hanna, the pro-European Social Democratic and Labour MP for Belfast South, said: “The fact that this is being lauded as a big win sums up Brexit.

At the time, the charity was forced to deny his departure was related to claims of bullying which surfaced on social media via an anonymous Twitter account, subsequently deleted.Hughes, who co-chaired a dementia friendly communities champion group for the former prime minister David Cameron, is due to take up a new role as chief executive of Samaritans in May.It has now emerged that a complaint was made to the Charity Commission in February 2018 by a former employee of the Alzheimer’s Society. The complaint raised concerns about the use of settlement agreements with non-disclosure provisions and the sums paid to settle claims.Despite the serious nature of the claims, the commission failed to investigate the complaint or even contact the whistleblower – an oversight the watchdog now admits was a mistake.In the 11-page complaint, the whistleblower said the large payouts by the charity “may also leave the society open to criticism … that it is silencing staff and critics of the organisation, undermining its stated values”.The complainant said they were informed “that the total cost of settlements in the last few years is over £750,000 for staff leaving the society, all with non-disclosure settlement agreement”.The Alzheimer’s Society claims the figure is inaccurate but declined to give its own sum. It said it only used settlements for “legitimate reasons”.The contents of the whistleblower complaint have emerged amid rising wider concern over the use of NDAs by organisations dealing with staff complaints. A House of Commons report last year warned “allegations of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace are routinely covered up by employers” using NDAs.The charity, which was launched in 1979, invests in dementia care research, runs campaigns and provides 3,000 local support services. It received income of £107m last year, with £80m from public donations. It has received £2.4m in taxpayers’ money over the last two years.An investigation by the  based on information detailed in the complaint and interviews with former employees reveals claims that:Claims about the charity’s handling of grievances are detailed in a 2018 complaint to the Charity Commission. A copy of the complaint, seen by the , flagged concerns about a series of issues, including “the disproportionate and excessive amounts being wasted on settling matters” and the “lack of accountability in the decision-making process to agree to the value of the complaints”.While many complaints made by staff who received settlements and signed NDAs were considered legitimate grievances, the whistleblower expressed concerns that some were not – meaning the charity was simultaneously viewed as a “soft touch”.The former staffer, whose family also made a donation to the Alzheimer’s Society after their mother died of dementia, added in the document: “I am aghast that charitable donations are being spent so recklessly and without the proper risk assessments or effective governance. My family sincerely regret the donation that we made in light of the use of charitable funds on these unnecessary payments.”Separately, a former senior employee at the charity told the  they were shocked at the behaviour they claim they witnessed by Hughes, who is understood to earn up to £160,000 a year.“Jeremy was well known within the organisation as someone with an explosive temper,” they said, “someone who didn’t appreciate being questioned even when this was when his staff were trying to understand what he wanted or what decision was being made.”The source alleged they had witnessed many instances of his poor behaviour, including shouting at junior staff and undermining senior staff, including trustees.They added: “It was widely known that to challenge Jeremy was career-limiting. Jeremy and Brett Terry, the HR director, worked very closely together to cross one was to cross them both and to incur their wrath and bullying.” They described “a culture of fear, or at least ‘keep your head down and don’t tell’”.Corinne Mills, the Alzheimer’s Society’s director of people and organisational development, said the charity took the allegations “very seriously” and that it had “zero tolerance” of bullying.“We have a well-established and robust internal complaints procedure and whistleblowing policy,” she went on, noting that internal processes were regularly reviewed. “We strongly refute the figure of £750k quoted for settlements. We have only used settlement agreements for legitimate reasons and only where other options for resolution have been explored.”The Charity Commission’s director of operations, Helen Earner, confirmed that a complaint was received about the charity in February 2018 but that the commission failed to act. The watchdog is now looking into the complaint. “We should have followed up on the complaint, and that did not happen,” she said.“We acknowledge that in failing to follow up on the complaint at the time, we did not meet the high standards we set ourselves, and which the public rightly expect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3ed7133d1504d1bb1fda325f82d71042b9481e4/92_0_3233_1941/master/3233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f744f751a79930359a016242aa53c70f","title":"tell us have you ever experienced a surgical accident","story":"If you have had a surgical procedure which has gone wrong we would like to hear from youDenis Campbell, health policy editor at the , exclusively reported on Michael Walsh, a shoulder surgeon who was sacked after allegations that he had harmed patients by performing surgery on them unnecessarily or badly.We would like to speak to people who have experienced any kind of surgical accident.

It is something I picked up on before the start of the tournament when Farrell was repeatedly talking about how Ireland had to stand for something. In other words what was their raison d’etre? International rugby is so congested at the top. On any given day, anyone is capable of beating anyone else and the Six Nations is even tighter. I genuinely believe that in international rugby it is no longer enough just to want to win. You have to have a reason. We saw it in the World Cup with South Africa. It was obvious what the Springboks stood for. They were all about fighting for hope and change in South Africa and that was far more powerful than that of their rivals.Farrell is now trying to work out Ireland’s reason for being and there are parallels with when Eddie Jones took over England. Before the 2016 Six Nations Jones spoke of the need to get back to the strong English tradition of having a good set piece. He had come in after a disastrous World Cup campaign but rather than make wholesale changes in personnel he kept largely the same group of players but set about altering the mindset. Granted, Farrell was already part of the setup under Joe Schmidt, and Ireland’s World Cup campaign was disappointing rather than disastrous, but he is doing the same kind of thing with largely the same group of players. Like Jones, Farrell has already set about bringing external voices into the group. Training camps can be very insular places so the benefit of having people like Bono or Paul O’Connell in Ireland’s case, or Arsène Wenger or Dave Brailsford for England, is huge.We have heard from a number of Ireland players lamenting how regimented things were under Schmidt, how that affected them during the World Cup and how, under Farrell, things have already changed for the better. I think it’s a tough balance, though. Let’s not forget how impressive Ireland were during 2018. They could not sustain it for another year, as numerous postmortems have shown, but in part is that not up to the players? It is like how we often talk about England needing to get to half-time to adapt and turn things around. It is no use Ireland players – and players with a lot of caps and a lot of experience – getting to the end of a World Cup and then complaining. The best and the most successful teams have enough player power to implement changes needed in the middle of the storm, not at the end of it.Farrell will know that but I’m sure he has listened to the feedback from the players and it was interesting to hear him acknowledge this week how he thought Ireland had dropped off from 2018 in terms of physicality.One would suspect Schmidt realised that, as demonstrated by his decision not to take Devin Toner to the World Cup and pick Jean Kleyn instead. Toner has come straight back in but the early signs of Ireland’s first two matches are good in terms of reaching those levels of physicality.I look back to Ireland’s win at Twickenham two years ago and the things that stood out were their fantastic set piece, their ball retention, their creativity and how utterly belligerent they were in sticking to a gameplan. At the moment I think we’re seeing those traits but in addition a bit more variation in what they are doing in the opposition’s 22. There seems an added layer of subtlety to their attack. They can be belligerent, as shown with Tadhg Furlong’s try against Wales, but contrast that with Johnny Sexton’s against Scotland. There were a number of pick-and-goes but then there were some lovely hands, changing the landscape for defenders, which is so hard to deal with when you are close to your own tryline, and Sexton ghosted over. Even with Jordan Larmour’s try against Wales, it was poor defending but I was pleased to see Ireland not be so reliant on the pick-and-go. They trusted their backs and their decision-makers to paint a different picture and it paid off.It is early days but Mike Catt will be having an influence. Catt is a very affable guy, huge on detail from running lines to depth and running speed – he was a brilliant distributor in his playing days and he reads the game so well. Italy probably wasn’t the best shop window for him to showcase that sort of quality but now he’s working with a higher calibre of players and, on top of that, he is a new voice in the Ireland setup which will be invaluable.Every year I believe the third round of the Six Nations is the pivotal one. England are under huge pressure. They always are but this is their first match at home since the World Cup final. If Ireland get a result, however, it really does draw a line under their dismal 2019. The key areas will be the battle for the air, the battle for the ground and the emotional factor because there are so many subplots. Take the captains, for example – Owen Farrell and Sexton are so similar.Owen is captaining England against his dad while Sexton is almost like the stepbrother in it all. They are both the emotional barometers for their respective teams and how they go about reaching the right levels without overstepping the mark will be of huge importance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2fa5a413a8b69759cf559bc21997876bd71bf2c/0_94_5519_3311/master/5519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c06ab956c934b84c0f6395002371f8f","title":"italy v scotland six nations 2020 live","story":"“The only pressure is the pressure we put on ourselves,” Scotland captain Hogg said this week. “We believe in our collective ability to win rugby matches ... everything else is irrelevant.”Italy will no doubt be looking to exert some pressure of their own. “I’m very confident,” now says pundit Marco Bortolami on ITV, speaking to Gabriel Clarke. “I think this team is ready to deliver a big performance. The key thing is to earn the right to play wide. The front five need to create go-forward for the backs.”The sun is out in Rome it’s a far cry from the way Storm Ciara battered Muarrayfield a couple of weeks back. ITV pundit Sir Ian McGeechan says that means the visitors need to deliver some decent rugby this afternoon: “For Scotland, no excuses,” McGeechan says. “In the conditions today, you’d want to see the king of high-tempo game that they can play.“The back rows will be important. Who wins the breakdowns, who wins the front-foot ball ... that could well be the difference,” McGeechan adds.Franco Smith sticks with the same starting team that impressed at times during their defeat in Paris:Gregor Townsend makes three changes for Scotland. Gloucester’s Chris Harris comes in for Huw Jones at outside centre, Ben Toolis replaces the injured Jonny Gray at lock, and Stuart McInally comes in for Fraser Brown at hooker.Who will be in possession of ‘il cucchiaio di legno’ come the middle of next month? The last time Italy managed to avoid the wooden spoon was five years ago, when they narrowly, stirringly defeated Scotland at Murrayfield. And that, as you probably know, is the last time the Azzurri won a Six Nations match. There are reasons to be cheerful. From an attacking point of view, they weren’t as bad as the 42-0 scoreline in the opener against Wales suggests. And as their coach Franco Smith rightly says Italy showed improvement in Paris two weeks ago, successfully building momentum in attack and achieving the kind of continuity that has generally eluded them at European rugby’s top table. Wasps’ Marco Minozzi has been a constant running threat and fly-half Tommaso Allan has shown some lovely touches at times.Coaches generally trot out the necessary platitudes about treating each opponent and each match just the same, but Smith and his players know this is by far their best chance of getting a ‘W’ on the board in this tournament. Expect them to start fast.As for the visitors, Scotland’s year so far has been punctuated by Stuart Hogg’s two horror moments in narrow defeats by Ireland and England - plus head coach Gregor Townsend’s public falling out with Finn Russell, who remains out in the cold. It’s hardly been a happy campaign for them so far but victory in Rome today will see some semblance of order restored. Lose, and the sausages on social media are sure to be out in force. Scottish captain Hogg got back on his horse with Exeter to stunning effect a few days ago. A few more moments of magic like this, and Hogg and his team will be heading home from Italy with a win on the board.

Airbnb has disputed the finding.Meanwhile, an organisation representing landlords has warned that imminent tax changes will drive an increasing number of landlords towards Airbnb and its rivals, depriving renters of long-term, stable tenancies.Last month Lucas asked the government to make it easier for councils to impose a 90-day cap on homes let out on Airbnb and other online platforms. Airbnb says the vast majority of properties on the platform are already rented for less than 90 days a year.She wants the UK government to follow Scotland’s lead. In January Holyrood announced new measures giving local authorities in Scotland powers to regulate short-term lets. This includes a licensing scheme with health and safety stipulations, which would also allow councils to address the concerns of local residents. A tax on short-term lets is also being considered.“Brighton and Hove city council should be given the powers to regulate this industry, which is having such a serious impact on an already overstretched private rental sector and on more highly regulated hotels and B\u0026ampBs, which are being undercut. There needs to be a level playing field,” said Lucas.“The pressure put on the availability of local housing by Airbnb in some areas of UK is intolerable. Local councils must be given powers to regulate this, so local housing needs are not squeezed out,” she tweeted on Friday.Airbnb said the ’s data was flawed and that some listings were for hotel rooms, single rooms in homes, and unusual properties such as caravans, meaning their rental did not affect housing stock.Patrick Robinson, the company’s director of public policy, said: “Airbnb is a good partner to cities and we were the first platform to limit how often hosts in London can share their homes. We are also working with cities across the UK on proposals for a host registration system that we will proactively put to the government later this year to help ensure that rules work for everyone.”But some critics of the company in hotspot areas say the saturation of their neighbourhoods is changing their way of life. Chris Hayes, a 55-year-old train driver who lives in the North Laine area of Brighton, said his life was being made a misery because five of the 29 cottages in his row were being advertised on Airbnb and similar sites.“Residents have no way of stopping noise without confrontation. The owners are unknown or uncontactable, the ‘hosts’ do not have contact numbers for out-of-office hours, the council does not have noise abatement officers at night, the police treat it as very low priority,” he said, complaining of being woken by parties and the sound of suitcases being trundled along the alleyway in the middle of the night.He added: “Airbnbs should be a planning change of use from residential. You need a change of use to convert a home to an office, hotel or shop. Why not to Airbnb?”The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) warned on Friday that renters were finding it harder to access long-term homes to rent because taxation changes are driving landlords to move into the holiday lettings market.Last month, research from ARLA Propertymark found that nearly half a million UK properties could be left unavailable for longer-term rent as more landlords exit the market in favour of short-term lettings. Many landlords blame the government for restricting mortgage interest relief to the basic rate of income tax, claiming they will be significantly worse off or even unable to make a profit on their lettings.David Smith, the RLA’s policy director, said: “Government policy is actively encouraging the growth of holiday homes at the expense of long-term homes to rent, which many families need. This is completely counterproductive, making renting more expensive and undermining efforts to help tenants save for a house of their own.“The chancellor must use his budget to give tenants a better deal by supporting good landlords to provide the homes to rent that they want to live in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0123e321841d903c3b01813ea03fa112d19e370/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a29aea914b167fbb0db9eb50d867f8","title":"tiktok viral stars could make up to 1m per post say researchers","story":"Video app’s most popular users could rake in millions by collaborating with brandsTeenagers used to aspire to become astronauts, firefighters, footballers or pop stars, but times change and so do career goals. Today, more than half of millennials and Generation Z-ers – those aged 13-38 – in the US aspire to become social media influencers, according to recent research.The Chinese viral video app TikTok is the platform of choice for young people seeking to monetise their talents because it seen as rewarding anyone’s ability to entertain, whereas Instagram or YouTube tend to reward those who already have celebrity status.And for a very lucky few, taking to TikTok could be a seriously lucrative career option. Marketeers reckon that the most popular TikTokers could currently charge close to $200,000 (£155,000) per post if they promote and collaborate with brands. Researchers at Morning Consult, a US tech research group working on behalf of the games company Online Casino, argue that TikTok is growing so fast in popularity that some influencers might even be able to charge nearly $1m per post by next year.Loren Gray, a 17-year-old singer from Pennsylvania, is said to be the most marketable current TikToker, with researchers estimating she could charge as much as $197,000 (£152,000) per post.Gray has more than 38 million followers on TikTok – which posts videos of between 15 and 60 seconds in length – making her one of the most-followed accounts. Gray has used her popularity on the app to secure record deals with Virgin Records and Capitol Records. She posts daily on the platform and her posts have received over 2bn likes.Last year, the US fast food chain Chipotle paid Gray to participate in a “guac song dance-off”. The hashtag challenge – an official TikTok campaign in which a creator uses a specific hashtag for a sponsored video – was called #GuacDance. The campaign centred on a song about guacamole from the children’s music artist Dr Jean, and went viral.Further down the top 20 is Jiffpom, a Los Angeles-based Pomeranian dog with 20 million followers – double his Instagram following – who could earn $100,000 per post, the report adds.The report predicts that in a year’s time, Aashika Bhatia, a 19-year-old Indian actress, will be the most popular on the platform, with 194 million followers. She currently has 14 million and is gaining tens of thousands per day. The Bollywood actress posts TikTok classic videos of her lip-syncing and joking around. The popularity of posters like Bhatia is explained by the simplicity of the format, says the report: easy video design means short video clips can be created in minutes music, dance and slapstick humorous clips transcend language barriers, which means they can be viewed on every continent and the videos automatically loop to the next on the Tiktok feed, making it an easy watch.Morning Consult estimates that popular TikTok stars could be paid up to $0.005 per follower for sponsored posts, which means a star like Bhatia could charge $973,000 per post if she reached the 194 million mark.TikTok, which is owned by the Beijing-based tech company ByteDance, was valued at $75bn in 2018 when Japan’s richest man – Masayoshi Son - invested in it via his SoftBank venture fund. It claims to have about 800 million active users, which would make it more popular than Twitter and Snapchat combined, but trailing Facebook.The company has been fined $5.7m by US authorities for illegally collecting children’s data. It has also been criticised for censoring videos that might upset the Chinese government, including mentions of Tiananmen Square or Tibetan independence.The Snapchat founder, Evan Spiegel, said this week he was “a big fan” of TikTok and expected TikTok to surpass Instagram, which is owned by Facebook and said in 2018 it had passed the 1 billion active user mark.“Social media in its original construct is really about status: representing who you are, showing people that you’re cool, getting likes and comments, those sorts of things,” Spiegel said last month. TikTok instead celebrates talent over status, he said, describing it as a platform for people to “make media to entertain other people”.Paying just under $1m to a TikTok influencer for a post may sound like an unbelievable amount of money for a company to spend on marketing, but James Whatley, strategy partner at the marketing agency Digitas UK, said it showed how brands were shifting their attention and spending away from traditional media like TV and billboard advertising to partnering with “authentic influencers”.Whatley explained that influencers can spread a brand further than their already huge number of followers, which can be greater than the population of small countries. “There are challenges on TikTok, for example you could pay an influencer to do a challenge but with a bottle of Diet Coke,” he said. “As soon as that person does it, all of their followers will see it and want to participate and recreate themselves, and then all their followers will do it also, and you’ve got yourself a viral sensation.”Paul Lee, the global head of technology research at consultancy firm Deloitte, said he expected only a handful of people would be able to make a lot of money out of TikTok, but he said those who did could “really strike it big”.“If you have 10 million followers it’s better than 5 million, obviously,” Lee said. “It’s quite a benign site. It’s happy, and of people doing fun videos. You go there to get uplifted, and it feels less commercial, which could actually make partnerships more valuable.“Endorsements are always valuable, but it can be shocking how one person’s endorsement is worth lots more than other people’s. I don’t think mine would be worth so much. To become an influencer your timing has to be right, your look has to be right and you have to be super lucky.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8ffbac9e9d8314e5538e7c0df49ed0cbf76dac/0_61_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deeee16be728f6b3c16695e20b901b18","title":"friends cast reunion hbo max special","story":"Matthew Perry posts: ‘It’s happening’ as HBO confirms show to appear on streaming platform HBO MaxFriends fans can rejoice – The One Where They All Get Back Together is officially on.HBO has confirmed that the cast of Friends will reunite for a special on the streaming platform HBO Max, the Hollywood Reporter reported on Friday. The reunion will premiere in May, HBO says.All six stars of the NBC sitcom, which aired for ten seasons between 1994-2004, will return for the special.The actor Matthew Perry announced the news on Instagram with two words: “It’s happening.”The reunion will be unscripted, and is set to feature the series’ creators, David Crane and Martha Kauffman, as well as the actors Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. It will be taped in Stage 24 of the infamous Warner Bros lot in Burbank, where Friends filmed its entire run.Kevin Reilly, chief content officer at HBO Max, told the Hollywood Reporter he was thrilled to have seen the show “catch on with viewers generation after generation. It taps into an era when friends – and audiences – gathered together in real time and we think this reunion special will capture that spirit, uniting original and new fans.”There had been a flurry of media reports about a potential reunion since Aniston hinted last year that something might be under way.Aniston spoke to the talkshow host Ellen DeGeneres about a possible new Friends project, saying: “We would love for there to be something, but we don’t know what that something is. So we’re just trying. We’re working on something.”The idea of a Friends reunion has met with mixed reactions from critics and fans.When rumors of the reunion first surfaced in November, the ’s Stuart Heritage wrote: “Another shot, even for a truckload of cash, would only further diminish what Friends once was.

The administration responded with two supplemental programs that will cost about $7m a year – one that will offer a yearly $2,500 need-based housing fellowship and another that offers doctoral students a five-year funding program. The supplemental programs would not be nearly enough for graduate students to get by in Santa Cruz, Komori said. Two weeks ago, the students escalated their strike, and one week ago, the University of California president, Janet Napolitano, announced that the strike “will have consequences, up to and including the termination of existing employment at the University”.Lori Kletzer, the executive vice-chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, set a deadline for 11:59pm Friday for all graduate students to turn in their grades. “We are giving these students one final opportunity to fulfill their teaching responsibilities and show that they can fulfill future responsibilities,” she wrote. “Those who do not submit full grade information by February 21 will not receive spring quarter appointments or will be dismissed from their spring quarter appointments.”For many students, that will mean having to drop out of their programs, Komori said. For international students like Komori, who is from Canada, that can put visas at risk. “It’s a big scary decision for a lot of people, but there’s been a lot of really positive conversations,” she said. “One thing is that our administration hasn’t guaranteed that we won’t face some kind of discipline or retaliation even if we do turn in the grades. We haven’t closed the poll but a good number, potentially a majority of people, still plan on withholding grades and will continue to hold them past the deadline.”All the graduate students have pledged not to take the teaching assistantships of anyone who has been fired, a move that will have an impact on the next quarter. Komori adds that a mass firing could “significantly affect” the number of courses the school could offer in the next academic quarter.The administration has cited this as a reason for not negotiating with the graduate students. “To accede to the demands of a group of employees engaged in an unauthorized wildcat strike would undercut the very foundation of an agreement negotiated in good faith by the UAW and ratified by thousands of members across the system,” Napolitano said.The administration agrees the “housing crisis is complex, systemic, and at the same time, deeply personal for many”, Kletzer wrote. “Where we differ, however, is in the approach to solve this problem.”Meanwhile, the movement is growing. Talk of “spread the strike” has begun at UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC San Diego, UC Riverside and UC Merced, Komori said. On Wednesday, the Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Bernie Sanders tweeted his support.“It’s incredibly empowering for people who are getting fired on our own campus to know that there will be major disruption throughout the university system and a ton of pressure on the office of the president when those campuses go on strike with us,” Komori said. “I think if all the campuses stand together on this, they won’t have a choice but to address it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/753f9dc899b443bb8138dc9b25802c6800189377/0_0_3765_2259/master/3765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a872b66abe8675af91d240d1eac6435e","title":"brits coronavirus diamond princess cruise ship to fly home","story":"Thirty-two British and European passengers from Diamond Princess on board plane due to land in England on Saturday, Foreign Office says The British government has begun repatriating its citizens trapped on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship in Japan for more than two weeks.“The evacuation flight from Japan has now departed with 32 British and European passengers on board, as well as British government and medical staff,” the Foreign Office said in a statement on Saturday. The plane was expected to land at Boscombe Down military base in southern England on Saturday morning UK time, it said. Passengers would then be placed in a further 14-day quarantine.The Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined off Tokyo on 5 February when a passenger who left in Hong Kong was found infected with the virus. The repatriation flight came after earlier being delayed. More than 70 British nationals onboard, who had been confined to cabins except for brief trips on deck wearing masks and gloves, had been due to fly home on Friday. The Diamond Princess was carrying more than 3,700 people in early February when 10 passengers were diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain of the disease.Since it has been quarantined in the port of Yokohama, a total of 634 passengers and crew have been infected, accounting for more than half of all the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China. The four Britons onboard the Diamond Princess who have tested positive will not be on the flight.David and Sally Abel from Northamptonshire have been documenting their time on the quarantined ship on Facebook. The couple are now being treated in a Japanese hospital after days shut in their cabin following their diagnosis.David Abel admitted he was initially sceptical about whether his diagnosis was accurate, but since confirmed both he and his wife had tested positive.In his latest post, he said: “Full health inspection and now we know what’s going on. We both contracted a cold (unaware of) and it has not yet turned into pneumonia. (We do have coronavirus.) Tomorrow the big tests commence. Chest X-rays, ECG, chest scan, urine and more.”He said that after treatment, the couple would need three rounds of all-clears on coronavirus tests. He said: “Wifi will not work for me, so this will be the final communication for some time. See you all before you know it.”Meanwhile, Britons in Cambodia who left another cruise ship, the Westerdam, and who have been cleared for travel, are being assisted by the Foreign Office to make their way home. The group are receiving health advice and being helped with commercial flight bookings. All have tested negative after one case was diagnosed on board. The number of Britons in the group has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether some have already come back to the UK.Public Health England said airport health teams would meet the flights and speak to Westerdam passengers about any symptoms. If they do not have symptoms, passengers will be given health advice and told to self-isolate at home for 14 days but, if they have symptoms, they will be taken to hospital for testing.As of 2pm on Thursday, a total of 5,549 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, of whom nine have tested positive.There have been more than 75,000 confirmed infections recorded in mainland China and about 1,070 cases in 26 other countries – including those on the Diamond Princess.Authorities in China recorded 118 deaths on Thursday, bringing the total to 2,236 inside the country.In the World Health Organization briefing on Thursday, the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: “You will get sick of me saying that the window of opportunity remains open for us to contain this Covid-19 outbreak. WHO is doing everything we can to seize that window of opportunity, and we urge the international community to do the same.”He said the data continued to show a decline in new cases but that this was “no time for complacency”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2a6fcc81c3a697a542dedd8fd7b1a9692074e99/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c26ec7e42c8b5a4e152bf3d748cd8db6","title":"how italy blends culture with cuisine a photo essay","story":"Photographer Harriet Zawedde was born in Rome but raised in the UK. Her series Nightshade, combines portraits with botanical images of the tomato plant and the subjects’ recipesThe English word tomato derives from the Aztec word tomatl. It is believed the Aztecs and Incas were cultivating and eating the tomato from 700AD. Though the tomato originated from the Andean region, it eventually spread north to Mexico. The scientific name for the tomato is solanum lycoperscicum.While the Spanish were responsible for bringing the tomato to Europe in the early 16th century, its first reference in Italy was in 1544 in Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s Herbal, who refers to the tomato as pomi d’oro meaning golden apple. The tomato was not used in cooking until the 18th century as it was often viewed with fear and suspicion as a member of the nightshade plant family, which had plants such as the mandrake among them.Once the names the tomato were called were amended and confusion and ambiguity as to what it was subsided, it was able to illustrate its full potential. After its family ties became less relevant and it was allowed to exist for what it was, not how it looked, it thrived. This took an element of trust.Below, Nightshade’s subjects discuss their favourite recipes.I can tell you, lasagna is the first dish I learned to cook. I moved out from my parents’ house without knowing how to cook even a common pasta but since lasagna and pollo con patate, are my favourite dishes, I learned how to cook them first. Even though making the ragu isn’t so easy. I tried my best and my lasagna is one of the best in town, if you get in Brianza by any chance, you’ve got to taste it.Fry the onion until softened. Add the carrot and cook for five minutes, then add the celery and cook for another two minutes. Turn up the heat, add the chopped beef and cook until browned all over.Make a ragu over an afternoon, pour in the wine and passata, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of grated nutmeg, then bring to a simmer.Make your own béchamel. Place cooked ragu into an overproof dish and layer. Top with parmesan. Garnish with basil.This is a classic Italian recipe. If you ever jump on a plane to Italy, don’t miss it.Since I was a child, this has been my favourite recipe. I remember cooking it for every family party, even for my sister’s wedding. With this recipe you will never go too far wrong. Your guests will love Crostata. This recipe is a mix of authentic Italian flavours, in which lemon and marmellata (jam) are the main ingredients for a unique and refined taste.Good luck and enjoy!Ingredients: 250g cold butter from the fridge | 200g of icing sugar | 500g of 00 flour | 2 eggs | The rind of an untreated lemon | 400g of jam | Enough milk to brush the surface | A pinch of saltPut the flour, butter and a pinch of salt in the mixer. Mix in order to obtain an uneven sandblasting.Add the eggs, icing sugar and lemon peel to flavour the pastry and allow the citric acid to make it crumbly.Knead the dough before putting it onto a work surface. Start working it with the fingertips, to create a nice compact dough. Wrap it in clingfilm and let it rest for 30 minutes in the fridge, or ideally overnight.After letting the dough rest, we heat it and flatten it. Aim for a thickness of 78mm. Transfer the dough into a 24cm diameter cake pan and pinch the bottom with a fork.Then we make our short pastry with jam, we distribute it on the edge. After that, prepare 3 or 4cm strips of dough and place on to the jam, applying pressure to the edges. Lay the strips diagonally creating a grid of pastry and diamond shapes of jam. To make the tart shiny, brush the milk on the pastry with a pastry brush. After that, we bake the tart in a pre-heated oven at 170C for 50 minutes.Fiorentina is one of the most popular and biggest steak in Italian cuisine.I have eaten this more than three times and its taste was undeniable. I think it is one of the best dishes that I often have because it reminds me of Tuscany’s fabulous and iconic lifestyle.Use the highest quality steak, ideally Tuscan or Italian. Cook on an open fire if possible (on the embers of the grill). Rare or medium rare only. Garnish with salt and pepper.Pizza has always been a reason to gather with my friends. Pizzerias were fancy enough for our student pockets. When my mum would make pizza at home, we were always very excited.For me, it was nice to see the first generation of immigrants learning the Italian cooking as their way of integration.Ingredients: Semolina pizza dough | tablespoon olive oil | 2 cloves chopped garlic | 5 mushrooms thinly sliced | mozzarella cheese | 1 can tomatoes | chopped roma | 1 bell pepper| thinly sliced prosciutto | salt \u0026amp pepper to taste | oregano | pepper flakesPreheat oven to its hottest setting for 45 minutes. With about 1 teaspoon olive oil, sauté the sliced mushrooms and a pinch of salt over medium heat for 5-10 minutes, until well browned. Set aside.Sprinkle semolina on your baking sheet. Place the dough on top of the semolina and roll out into a circular shape. Brush the outer edges with olive oil and chopped garlic. Spread chopped tomatoes from the centre out to the edge of the oiled crust.Evenly place your toppings (mushrooms, mozzarella, bell pepper, etc) on the dough. Sprinkle with salt, Italian seasoning and pepper flakes, to taste. Add Parmesan cheese if desired.Transfer the pizza onto your stone by sliding it off the baking sheet. Bake for 10+ minutes, or until the crust is nicely browned and the cheese is bubbly. Remove with tongs and let rest for five minutes.I usually cook it during summer for lunch, after a long morning at the beach. It is easy, quick and everyone loves it, including my kids. The pepper is not that hot. It is a plate that I particularly love because I buy the shrimps fresh from the local fish store near the beach.Ingredients: Shrimps from Marsala Tomatoes from pachino | 300g spaghetti | Olive oil | Garlic | Hot pepper | SaltIn a frying pan add some oil, garlic and hot pepper then mix all together until the mixture becomes a little golden. In the meantime, boil some water for the pasta.Add two or three tablespoons of the boiling water into the mixture. Then let it sit for a couple of minutes until the pasta is cooked. Add salt and pepper. Mix everything together.Aubergines are my all-time favourite late summerwinter vegetable. This dish reminds me of childhood, having a family meal at a local tavola calda. It can be eaten as a standalone dish or as part of a secondo piatto. It’s one of the most unassuming yet deliciously hearty dishes. I’ve probably adulterated the dish to suit my palette but this is a firm favourite for me to prepare for my nearest and dearest. If you want a leaner version of this dish, try grilling the aubergines instead. An exceptionally tasty vegetarian treat.Ingredients: 3 large aubergines | 1 bottle of tomato passata | 2 cloves of garlic 2 balls of mozzarella | 1 cup of parmigiano reggiano (grated) | 1 cup of extra virgin olive oil | 1 cup flour | 1 cup vegetable oil | Black pepper to taste | Fresh basil to taste | Salt to tastePreheat oven to 180C (356F). Slice aubergines lengthways but leave skin on. Place in a bowl and sprinkle two tablespoons of salt over them and leave for an hour to remove the moisture.In the meantime prepare the sauce. Add two teaspoons of olive oil to a pan and finely chop garlic cloves. Fry until softened. Add passata and cook on medium heat on hob for 15 minutes. Tear and add fresh basil and black pepper and salt. Cook for a further 10 minutes. Chop mozzarella into small cubes.Place flour into a bowl. Take aubergines out of salt and coat each in the flour. Prepare a new pan with two tablespoons vegetable oil and fry off flour coated aubergines- about 1-2 minutes each side. Place on kitchen towel to absorb oil. Add more cooking oil to pan if required.Prepare an oven baking dish. Start by spoon- ing some of the passata onto the base. Then place a layer of aubergines on top, add some passata, parmesan and mozzarella. Repeat until all ingredients have been used.Bake for 25-30 minutes. Serve with a sprig of basil and enjoy this heart-warming beautiful dish.This is a classic Italian antipasto. It is the perfect dish for when you invite your friend for dinner because it is easy to make and very tasty.Slice mozzarella and tomato and place on plate. Apply a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt, pepper and fresh oregano.This dish reminds me of the long summers in my childhood, and I used to enjoy this on a picnic or by the beach. It brings memories of laughs, sun, water, running barefoot in the hot sand, beach games and the joy of eating all together.Ingredients: 4-5 medium firm ripe round tomatoes seeded and hollowed out | 1 cup uncooked rice (I used long grain par boiled) 185 grams | 1 teaspoon oregano 12 gram | 1 teaspoon basil 12 gram | 12 teaspoon salt 2 12 grams | 12 gram *6 springs fresh chopped Italian parsley | 1 clove garlic chopped | 14 - 12 cup chopped tomato pulp 55-82 grams | 2-3 tablespoons olive oilPre-heat oven to 180C (375F) and lightly oil a large baking pan. In a medium bowl add rice and cover with water, allowing it soak for one hour, then drain and rinse.Rinse and dry tomatoes, carefully cut off top of tomato and set aside. Remove seed and pulp from the tomatoes, set aside the pulp and discard the seeds.In a medium bowl mix chopped tomato pulp, oregano, salt, parsley, garlic, 2-3 tablespoons (45 grams) olive oil and rice. Fill hollowed out tomatoes with mixture. Place tops back on tomatoes, sprinkle tomatoes with a little salt and drizzle with olive oil.Add roasted potatoes with rosemary and bake for approximately 45- 60 minutes or until potatoes and rice are tender. Serve immediately. Enjoy.This is my favourite dish for three reasons: though based on rather basic ingredients, it is unabashedly rich and indulgent its reddishorangey colours evoke those of my favourite team (AS Roma), and you can do an excellent version of it in under 30 minutes.Ingredients: Guanciale (cured Italian pig cheek. Do not use pancetta in any circumstance) | Pecorino Romano (abundant) | Tomato passata Calabrian chili | Salt | Pepper | Rigatoni or bucatini | WineDice the guanciale into thin strips. Remember to remove the hard part of the skin, and to slice off a bit of fat if the ratio of meat to fat is less than 1:3. Add to a non-stick pan at medium heat and let it heat gently until the guanciale is crispy and the fat renders.Add a splash of dry white wine (like a frascati), to deglaze the pan. This step is optional. Once the alcohol has evaporated, add some flakes of chilli and a high-quality tomato passata (or blended chopped tomatoes). Add some seasoning (but not too much salt), and let it simmer on a medium heat.In the meantime, bring water to the boil, and add either rigatoni (short pasta) or bucatini, depending on your (and guests’) preference. Tip: growing up I was always told that the water of the pasta must be as salty as the Mediterranean. Few things are more upsetting than an under-salted pasta. So be generous when salting the boiling water for pasta. Two minutes before the pasta is ready, set aside some of the starchy boiling water, and then quickly decant and add to the sauce.Another tip: always toss pasta into sauce, not vice versa. The pasta is at its most absorbent in the 10 seconds after it has been drained, so don’t waste time in mixing it with the sauce. As you toss it in, add in generous heaps of grated pecorino cheese, which should gently melt. This renders the sauce less red but also thicker. Use the water set aside to regulate the consistency. A good amatriciana must have a touch of sleepiness to it.Plate - on a heated plate preferably, add some grated pecorino and buon appetito."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcce0fafcb5719b92f4b1e5791568a5963af5dcb/0_53_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db625490576d4a9eaa0d4e5259f2e5f9","title":"justin trudeau canada rail blockades","story":"PM demands end to ‘untenable and unacceptable’ rail blockades erected in support of Indigenous activists fighting gas pipelineJustin Trudeau has demanded that protesters lift railway blockades that have been erected across Canada in support of Indigenous activists who are fighting a natural gas pipeline.“The situation as it currently stands is unacceptable and untenable,” the prime minister said on Friday afternoon. “Canadians have been patient. Our government has been patient. But it has been two weeks, and the barricades need to come down now.”Rail barricades – both on and outside Indigenous reserves – have sprung up across the country in solidarity with members of the Wet’suwet’en First Nation who are opposing a C$6.6bn (US$4.98bn) natural gas pipeline in British Columbia.The blockades have been blamed for 1,400 layoffs at Canada’s main rail companies, propane shortages in eastern Canada and economic hardship for farmers.Trudeau’s comments came just days after he pledged in parliament to continue dialogue with Wet’suwet’en activists leading protests against the 416-mile Coastal GasLink pipeline. Many other Nations have signed benefits agreements with the company in exchange for their green light on the project.After Trudeau’s press conference, Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chief Woos repeated the band’s call for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to withdraw from its land and a halt in construction before talks could begin.“We heard Prime Minister Trudeau just a little while ago talking about the inconvenience Canada has suffered. However, there is a difference between inconvenience and injustice,” he said.The Wet’suwet’en nation have lived on their territories in what is now British Columbia for thousands of years. They have never signed treaties or sold their land to Canada.\u0026nbspWith a\u0026nbsppopulation\u0026nbspof about 5,000, the Wet’suwet’en\u0026nbspare composed of five clans (Gilseyhu, Likhts’amisyu, Laksilyu, Tsayu and Gidimt’en), which are further ided into 13 house groups, each with its own distinct territories.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Unist’ot’en, the People of the Headwaters, belong to the Gilseyhu clan.\u0026nbspHereditary chiefs are responsible for the health and sustainability of their house group territories, and Wet’suwet’en law prohibits trespass on the territory of other the house groups.\u0026nbspWet’suwet’en people have retained their legal traditions and continue to govern themselves through the Bahtlats (feast hall), where decisions are ratified and clan business is conducted.On Thursday, the federal public security minister agreed to pull RCMP police officers out of Wet’suwet’en territory, but late on Friday afternoon, the Wet’suwet’en nation said that rather than leave, police had had actually “increased harassment, made illegal arrests, increased surveillance and monitoring of Wet’suwet’en people and their invited guests.”Glen Coulthard, an associate professor in political science and the First Nations and Indigenous Studies Program at the University of British Columbia, and a member of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, predicted that Trudeau’s comments would escalate the conflict.“He has placed the onus, the burden of proof, on Indigenous peoples to demonstrate their commitment to reconciliation on his terms – or on the terms of a weaponized majority – by pitting so-called ‘regular Canadians and workers’ against Indigenous peoples who have been rendered minorities on their homeland due to colonization and a history of genocide,” said Coulthard.In the Canadian context, the word “reconciliation” is comparable to the issue of reparations for slavery in the US and UK. It speaks to the amends Canada has agreed to make to compensate for generations of abuse, racism and other crimes against Indigenous peoples.Trudeau has come under increasing political pressure to end the protests. Andrew Scheer, leader of the official opposition, has branded the protesters “radical activists” and has called on Trudeau to send in the police."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6e2ec908e7f900d6d7dbaba09b01589fffa4ff/0_263_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24580e4ae5c568de59d918ab9102f82","title":"post apocalyptic how coronavirus has altered day to day life wuhan north england","story":"From Wuhan to the north of England, people have been affected by the outbreak in different waysThe coronavirus is a public health emergency, but its threat is not only medical. Millions of lives have been altered by the outbreak, from those in self-isolation in China to Chinese nationals experiencing racism abroad. We talk to those affected in different ways, from Wuhan to the north of England.Wi, a 29-year-old Chinese PhD student in the Midlands, is originally from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak and where her parents have been in self-quarantine for more than 20 days. “They can’t walk, they can’t leave their own flat – it’s not a holiday, it’s like jail,” she said. “They are unable to even open windows for fear that the virus will spread through the air.“Now the whole of Wuhan is closed, all public transport and private cars have been stopped, so they can’t even drive their own cars on the road. So they just stay at home, eating, sleeping and watching movies. That’s all they can do,” Wi said.Wi’s parents have not been told when they will be allowed to leave their flat. Wi has become concerned about the mental health of those in isolation in the city, after seeing posts on social media with locals saying they would rather kill themselves than remain in quarantine any longer.“The biggest enemy is not the virus, it’s mental health. When you stay in one room for half a month, that’s horrible, you cannot go outside or get fresh air.”A hundred miles from Wuhan, nestled in the countryside of Hubei province, British teacher Claude* is in self-isolation with his Chinese girlfriend and her family in her hometown, which the pair were visiting for the lunar new year.“After a day or two it became a ghost town,” Claude, 46, said. “The first week I was just relaxing – I work near Hong Kong so this was my holiday. I thought I would have more cabin fever by now, but I’m actually pretty fine. My girlfriends’s family are cooking lots and cleaning for us, so I’m being spoilt.” He described the town as “post-apocalyptic”, with speakers playing American swing music on empty streets, and men in biohazard suits checking people’s temperatures before they enter Walmart. He and his girlfriend still do not know when they will be allowed to leave. But when they finally return to their home in Shenzhen, they will be required to undergo another two weeks in quarantine.Claude said the mood in the town was “pretty chilled out”, but feared this could change in coming weeks as supplies run low. “As the days go on, more people are wearing masks, and people are standing further and further apart,” he said.In neighbouring Hunan province, Yuhan, a 28-year-old Chinese national who lives and works in Melbourne, is also trapped, after returning to visit her family for the new year.She has been in self-quarantine with her parents for 29 days, leaving only to visit her grandmother who lives 200 metres away. Yuhan worries that the isolation could last another two weeks.The family order groceries online once every two or three days, and spend most of their time cooking and watching TV. They usually go to her grandmother’s for lunch and leave food for her dinner. But Yuhan said many of her friends’ families would not leave the house at all.“My grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it’s sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her,” she said. “It is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news.”In the country’s most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs.Rob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire.“The worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too,” he said. “The school has said they can’t do anything – they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it’s illegal not to cancel their visas if they’re not working.”Rob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged £6 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenants’ allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them.Some people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles.Airline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people “blatantly tested far above the threshold” but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old. “My partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn’t seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren’t properly over their face.”At Heathrow, there were no checks or information. “It was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day,” he said. “I was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren’t even any posters. Us and a litany of sick coughing people from an Air China flight waltzed right out the airport.“There was hand sanitiser everywhere but no one seemed to use it,” he added. “I felt it was all a bit half-arsed.”Back in the UK, the Chinese community are feeling the effects of the virus. Lee*, a Chinese PhD student in the north of England, was subjected to racist abuse on a night out because of the coronavirus. He said he and two Chinese friends were on their way to a shopping centre one evening when three men in a car began shouting at them. “They called us ‘Chinese virus’ and ‘you Chinese bastards’,” Lee said.“We were really afraid. We passed them quickly and we kept silent because we were scared they might do something violent. There was nobody else out on the street and we wanted to stay safe. It felt very dangerous at the time.”Lee said that since the incident he has stayed at home more, only going out for university meetings or shopping for food.

By the slimmest of majorities, voters defied the status quo, and the party that did the best job convincing the public it would honour their will collected the political rewards.The dynamic unleashed by the 2013 plebiscite on buying the local utility grids back from private providers helps to explain why the city state is expected to buck national trends at this Sunday’s elections.Polls predict the ruling centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are in decline across Germany, will hang on to their Hamburg stronghold with relative ease. Their junior coalition partner, the Green party, is expected to increase its share of the vote, leading to a strengthened mandate for the current power-sharing deal.Yet a centre-left success in the city state is more likely to be the result of local factors than national trends.For one, Hamburg has managed to get de-privatisation done. In Berlin, by contrast, the senate announced its intention to buy back the district heating grid but has so far failed to drive the project through the courts. Hamburg sealed a €650m (£545m) deal last September.For Hamburg’s SPD – which campaigned against re-municipalisation, and is widely seen as more pro-business than elsewhere in the country – the buy-back has helped show it can also apply its famed pragmatism to more traditionally leftwing projects.The local party has been quicker to discover its green heart than other SPD branches in the country. And on Thursday, Hamburg’s SPD mayor, Peter Tschentscher, surprised his Green coalition partners by proposing to shut one coal unit at the city’s Moorburg power plant and convert the second to gas, in addition building a 100MW electrolyser to produce green hydrogen at the site.“If we hadn’t listened to voters, we would have been punished,” said Matthias Ederhof, an SPD candidate on the regional party list. “We are on the up because voters see us as competent.”The re-municipalised electricity grid, for which Hamburg paid the Swedish energy group Vattenfall €610m, has been making the city senate a healthy profit since 2017.The Greens are finding that having utility grids in public hands allows them to propose initiatives that would otherwise have sounded like pipe dreams. Hamburg, a city whose wealth has historically grown around its inland port, has in recent years turned into a busy laboratory for renewable energy schemes.Hamburg is now the first state in Germany to write a legally binding date into its constitution, the year 2030, not just for halving its carbon emissions from 1990 levels, but also for phasing out coal power for district heating altogether. The 250,000 households in the city which use district heating are still powered by coal stations in Wedel and Tiefstack.In the future, the Greens propose, Hamburg homes will be heated entirely from renewable sources such as waste incineration, biomass or solar power. There is a proposal to build a large heat storage system underneath the harbour, capturing excess heat produced in the summer for use during the winter by pumping hot salt water hundreds of meters deep into the soil.Even an old air raid bunker in the Wilhelmsburg district has been transformed into a so-called “energy bunker”, with a large heat reservoir. The city has the highest number of charging points for electric cars in Germany, more than Berlin or Munich.If Hamburg’s utility grid was still owned by Vattenfall, such experiments would have been unthinkable, said Christian Maass, a former state secretary for the environment and urban planning.“Private monopolies become a problem especially when the state doesn’t have the power and capacity to regulate them. In Hamburg, it therefore made more sense for the senate to hold the monopoly, because politicians can be held to account much more effectively than private companies,” said Maass, who now works as consultant on renewable energy.“Expectations on state-owned energy or heating grids are much more long-term and less orientated around maximising profit. If you want to shape the future of a city, that’s an immeasurable advantage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9367855d2243166f202f595b6762d4b1f1f65846/0_231_2476_1485/master/2476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa36cf64837a5880c55d19ce6f66c650","title":"india madhya pradesh sterilisation order withdrawn","story":"Health workers in Madhya Pradesh faced losing job if they did not sterilise at least one manAn instruction to male health workers in Madhya Pradesh to convince at least one man to opt for sterilisation or face losing their jobs has been withdrawn after a flurry of criticism.The order issued on 11 February said health workers had until the end of the current financial year to notch up one sterilisation.It was prompted by the fact that hardly any men in the state opt for vasectomy as a form of family planning. The burden of contraception is left overwhelmingly to women because of myths about how a vasectomy affects sexual functioning and male virility. Many men think it is tantamount to castration.But the Congress party, which is in power in Madhya Pradesh, was forced to rescind the order after rival Bharatiya Janata party leaders criticised it. “It is unacceptable for employees to be harassed in such a way. It is very objectionable,” said Rajneesh Agarwal, a BJP spokesman.Agarwal embarrassed the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Kamal Nath, by invoking the 1975 emergency – when civil liberties were suspended – under the former prime minister Indira Gandhi when her son Sanjay launched a gruesome campaign of sterilisation. Villages were enclosed and men virtually dragged into vans for forced sterilisation.More than 6 million men were sterilised in one year and 2,000 died from bungled operations. At the time, Nath was a close aide of Sanjay Gandhi.Mention of the 1975 emergency prompted Nath to tell his health minister, Tulsi Silawat, to rescind the order. “No one will be forced to be sterilised. No one is losing jobs and we are just spreading awareness,” said Silawat.The excesses during the emergency have ensured it is a brave Indian politician who brings up the subject of population control, despite the passing of so many decades and a population of 1.3 billion.One such rare intervention came from the BJP’s Venkaiah Naidu, India’s vice-president, earlier this month when he said no politician mentioned the country’s “galloping” population and how it hardly ever came up in parliament.He said: “The population is growing leaps and bounds, creating problems. See the problems in Delhi, traffic, more human beings, more vehicles, more problems more tension.”In the last five years in Madhya Pradesh, for example, only 3,397 vasectomies have been carried out, compared with 334,000 women who underwent sterilisation, even though the former is safer and easier.Besides, the central government believes family planning schemes should involve persuading men to take their share of responsibility instead of leaving it to women to make sure they do not get pregnant.Chaitali Verma, a women’s rights activist who works in Delhi slums, said most men cite the social stigma of vasectomy to get off the hook. “We all agree that Indian men need to start pulling their weight and taking responsibility for contraception but coercion isn’t the solution. It’s a sensitive problem and requires a sensitive approach,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763b6d11f7e6970a233b8b7329388ff57a3c3ffc/23_368_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51a3202dad8e10059a343153c452d232","title":"iran elections conservatives heading for large majority","story":"Likely outcome reflects frustration at collapsing living standards and relations with the westIran’s conservatives are heading for a large overall majority in the country’s parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results, an outcome that reflects frustration with collapsing living standards and the apparent dead end of engagement with the west.It means strong supporters of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, will control all the main levers of power in Iran except for the presidency. The reformists, elected four years ago on a ticket of engagement with the west, had been the largest party in parliament but found many of their proposals blocked by other centres of power in Iran, notably the  Council.The deadline for closing the 55,000 polling booths on Friday was repeatedly extended, with pro-government sources claiming the polls were kept open until midnight to cope with high turnout. Government opponents said officials had been hoping a last-minute rush might mask a voter boycott in the big cities caused by disillusionment with Iranian politics. With 42 of the 290 seats declared, four-fifths had fallen to conservatives.The run-up to the election, dismissed as a farce by the US government, had been marked by the mass disqualification of the best-known reformist candidates. Some, such as Ali Motahari, nevertheless turned out to vote in Tehran in protest against Donald Trump.Sayad Hassan Alavi, part of the independent grouping in parliament, said: “Considering the backdrop of falling living standards and the rise in petrol prices, the turnout was not that bad. When there is no money there is no reason and people feel alienated. The government should receive the message of this election.”Following the spread of the new coronavirus to Iran, the number of Iranians wearing face masks in the capital had visibly increased and a senior Tehran official said it added to the sense of a country battling on successive fronts.But government hardliners will be delighted if the principlists, as conservatives are termed, become the largest party in the 290-strong parliament on a respectable turnout.Presidential elections are due next year, leaving the centrist incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, to navigate a difficult year engaging with a strong, largely unsympathetic parliament.Initial results showed 14 former cabinet members in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s presidency had been elected, as well as his former central bank governor.The former mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, an Iraq-Iran war veteran and former commander of the Revolutionary Guards, was also heading for victory in Tehran, putting him in the running to take over the parliament’s speakership.That post had previously been held by Ali Larijani, who stood down to prepare for a likely run at the presidency.Reformers have threatened to pursue Ghalibaf over property deals from which he benefitted as president.Parliament has little direct leverage over foreign policy, but with this mandate it will feel it can intervene if Rouhani tried to engage in any talks with the US prior to a lifting of sanctions.The Iranian foreign ministry believes Trump has been gripped by a fantasy that the maximum economic pressure is going to lead to the Iranian regime’s fall. The election results, despite the low turnout, arguably show the regime’s power has been enhanced.Many ordinary Iranians at the polling booths said they were willing to withstand another six years of sanctions for the sake of their country’s independence..Reformists such as Motahari defended the reformist-led parliament’s record, saying other external Iranian bodies, such as the  Council, had blocked more than half of its legislation.He said the parliament was excluded when the government suddenly doubled petrol prices in November, prompting state repression of street protests. He said parliament had wanted to impeach the interior ministry for its handling of the protests, but had been ordered not to do so.The legislature had also pressed officials to reveal the official estimate of the number of Iranians killed by the state in the four days of protests, but said official bodies delayed doing so until after the election. Amnesty International has put the numbers in the hundreds. Three of those arrested in the protests have been sentenced to death.About 7,150 candidates from more than 16,000 hopefuls survived vetting by government-run panels and the  Council, a conservative body of clerics and jurists who assess commitment to Islam, corruption, belief in the system of religious law and the Islamic Republic.A third of all incumbents were thrown out, and reformers claimed tthat left no reformer candidates in more than 200 of the assembly’s 290 seats. These figures are disputed by the  Council, but there are no official figures on the politics of those disqualified."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4172516.1581585950!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how have our grey seals adapted to eat venomous weever fish","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGrey seals tend to eat fish whole. Illustration: Michael VineyIreland can boast one of the least toxic terrains on the planet, at least for people. With the exception of a few deadly mushrooms, which are avoidable, the most poisonous wildlife drifts in from outside – notably a few stinging jellyfish.Few if any of our fellow mammals in Ireland have needed to evolve ways of eating other, venomous, creatures. In the rest of the world at least 3O mammals are known to have developed biochemical defences that negate a poison or numb response to pain.That could be said, I suppose, about Ireland’s badgers and pine martens, attacking bees’ and wasps’ nests for grubs. But our hedgehogs, unlike some of those in continental Europe, do not include scorpions or vipers in their prey.All this makes it more intriguing that some Irish grey seals may specialise in eating the venomous weever fish, Echiichthys vipera, whose piercing of any human foot can prove extremely painful.Wintering at the moment in near-hibernation in deeper, warmer water at perhaps 150 metres, the hand-size lesser weever returns to the shallows in early summer, burrowing into the sand and resting there with just its eyes and the tip of its black dorsal fin exposed. Its ambition is the ambush of little fish such as blennies and gobies with a dart of its upward-pointing mouth.It is also equipped to punish anything that tries to eat it, or otherwise presses on its venomous dorsal spines. It can stay buried as the tide recedes and wait in the sand until the water comes back.Fear of the weever would occasionally haunt my own childhood paddling on the intertidal sands of Sussex. The memory was revived a year or two ago when Mayo surfers at nearby Carrowniskey began writing agitated blogs about the apparent concentration of weevers on that strand. “On the rare occasions when it is plentiful,” one expert wrote, “rows of erect black triangles decorate the sand floor of the seabed.”Something like that may have supplied the remarkable appetite of some seals for weevers reported in Biology and Environment, the journal of the Royal Irish Academy. The discovery is a spin-off from a study by four researchers at UCC, led by Dr Martha Gosch, examining the diet of grey seals for potential impact on commercial fisheries.Repeat offeringsThis entailed gathering some 150 seal scat (droppings, faeces) from sand banks at Raven Point in Wexford Harbour used as a haul-out by up to 300 animals. Collected between cleansing tides and across two years, the scats were unlikely to repeat offerings from the same iniduals.Weever remains, including the bony otoliths of the inner ear (a standard identification of fish), were found in 4 per cent of the droppings, including one scat with remains of 76 of them, plus one sign of flatfish. The relatively high abundance of weever in a limited number of scats, the study concluded, was “some evidence for specialisation”.It also suggested that the seals had developed a way of eating the fish without suffering from the venom. The skin inside a seal’s mouth and oesophagus is not especially thick compared with that of the leatherback turtle, which regularly eats jellyfish with toxic stings. Grey seals tend to eat fish whole, suggesting that they may have learned to gulp weevers head first, helping to push the poison spine flat.Seals themselves figure among specialised choices of prey. Wildlife films have shown spectacular and chilling sequences of killer whales (orcas) killing seals, surging onto beaches to drag them into the sea on the southern coast of Argentina or ganging up to make waves that wash Arctic seals off ice floes.Given the abundance of seals off Ireland and Scotland, this has me wondering why the orcas – two separate groups with seven or eight in each – have seemed to leave them alone.Some genetic research on orcas, including those of the north Atlantic, suggests that their small social groups have created “cultures” of hunting that are genetically inherited. Some, more nomadic, groups are seal eaters while others hunt fish and seabirds off particular coasts. The orcas that commute between west Scotland and Ireland are well-known as fish eaters, though others have been filmed eating harbour porpoises off Scotland. At Shetland last September, orcas were videoed flipping a harbour seal pup into the air, like the playful assassins of Argentina. And new research from the University of Aberdeen potentially links the orcas to a dramatic decline in numbers of Scotland’s harbour seals, with numbers in Orkney and Shetland dropping by 40 per cent in five years.Unlike the grey seals, which pup in late autumn, the smaller harbour seals pup in June and July, the months when most orca sightings are reported to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group. The last harbour seal surveys, almost two decades ago, found more than 4,000 of them around Ireland’coasts. It may soon seem appropriate to count them again."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Jean Vanier of L\u0026rsquoArche used \u0026lsquomystical explanations\u0026rsquo to justify sex abuse, report finds\u0026lsquoYou can\u0026rsquot say stuff, because it\u0026rsquos racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. 30 years ago it was the Irish.\u0026rsquoRebecca Harkin quarantined in Darwin after leaving Diamond Princess cruise linerTeen barricaded himself into Letterkenny house with shotgun and ammunitionThe final is on February 28th with the motion: \u0026lsquoThis house believes that the Irish criminal justice system is too weak on crime\u0026rsquoFor six decades, participants in the annual event have argued burning issues of the daySource calls report\u0026rsquos findings into Jean Vanier \u0026lsquodevastating, just bloody devastating\u0026rsquoL\u0026rsquoArche, which helps people with intellectual disabilities, has four communities in IrelandDoctor was previously found guilty of poor professional performance over hysterectomyGarda\u0026iacute are investigating following fatal incident on the R580 on Friday eveningMove is due to capacity constraints and the number of patients already on waiting list\u0026lsquoWhat if we gave people food that was better for them \u0026ndash wouldn\u0026rsquot they get better faster?\u0026rsquoThe Limerick man was murdered in his North Carolina home in 2015 as he sleptA number of Fianna F\u0026aacuteil TDs uneasy about Miche\u0026aacutel Martin\u0026rsquos speech regarding Sinn F\u0026eacuteinNew garda\u0026iacute bring to 14,467 the number of sworn members in the forceBrandon Lewis and T\u0026aacutenaiste meet for first time at Stormont House in BelfastStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4182175.1582376005!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish singer healthy and safe after leaving coronavirus ship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRebecca Harkin and her partner were both musicians on the Diamond Princess cruise liner which was forced into quarantine on February 3rd after it emerged that a former passenger had tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.An Irish singer who was among 4,000 people quarantined on a cruise ship off the Japanese coast at the start of the month because of coronavirus has expressed her gratitude to the authorities after being taken off the boat.Rebecca Harkin and her partner were both musicians on the Diamond Princess cruise liner which was forced into quarantine on February 3rd after it emerged that a former passenger had tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.All told 621 passengers and crew were found to have contracted the coronavirus making it the largest cluster outside China.

Credits are generated when a project is said to have reduced carbon by planting or protecting forests or investing in solar power. However, critics argue that there is no way to say that such projects would not have happened anyway and it is difficult to judge how well remote projects are working. In 2016, a study found that three quarters of carbon credits provided no environmental gain because the projects in question would have happened in any case.The  is one of the first media organisations ever to have gained access to illegal mining sites in eastern Madagascar and found that, despite carbon credits being sold on the basis that forest is being protected, there has been an increase in deforestation in recent years.The forest conservation zone is now set to be included in a second carbon credit sale, which is expected to bring $70 million to the region.Environmentalists say the issues found in Madagascar are echoed around the world, warning that the booming carbon offsetting industry could be doing more harm than good by greenwashing the real issues.In the CAZ – home to around 2,000 species of plant, of which 1,700 are endemic – the tensions between the need to protect the forest and the need of some of the world\u0027s poorest people to survive are clear.The area\u0027s sapphire rush began in earnest in 2016, and in Antsevabe, the village that acts as a gateway to the illegal mine, locals tell me that the people who have tin roofs on their homes are the ones who have found precious stones. Those with straw roofs are still farming.This is the border of the conservation zone, a beaten-up sign tells visitors who have taken a two-hour motorbike ride along a semi-dry river bed to reach it.Because of the conservation project, a forestry official is posted in the village. And because of security threats to the mine, so is a soldier who sits nonchalantly, an AK47 on his lap, outside the hut that doubles as the village cafe and store.Neither seems concerned about either the impact of mining or the stream of villagers who emerge from the protected forest with logs balanced on their heads. There are lots of mines in the forest, the forestry official says. There are a number of gold mines, and the sapphire mine has about 1,000 people working there.One person tells me that he found a small sapphire and built a house with the 20,000,000 Ariary (£4,100) he made from it. He rents out the house to those passing through to get to the mine, which is sometimes visited by Sri Lankan and Thai traders. It was a wise investment, he boasts. On the other hand, villagers are more dismissive about what the conservation project has done. Some say they were given seeds for plants, bananas and coffee. Some were paid to plant trees. Others say they are still farming and have nothing to do with the project.These views are echoed by a study which found that the project was not reaching the most remote communities. The study said a total of $13-15 million (£10 million-£11.5 million)was needed for compensation to them, but only $425,000 (£327,900) was being spent.Julia Jones, who conducted the study, says researchers are trying to point out a broader problem with carbon offsetting. The world needs to recognise the genuine cost. If you want to achieve a reduction in carbon emission by deforestation, it can\u0027t be done on the cheap,” she adds. The money has to get to the ones who are holding the axes – they are the ones who choose whether a tree gets chopped down or not.Conservation International, which runs the forest project on behalf of the Madagascan government, says it is now getting more money in but admits that slash and burn agriculture remains a major driver of deforestation.Environmentalists argue that the remoteness of the communities being used to generate carbon credits is, in part, the problem. How do you ensure that trees are not chopped down deep in a forest thousands of miles away?Those who run such projects from London or Washington are unlikely to ever trek 26 miles through a rainforest, over mountains and across more than 30 rivers to reach Tananarive, the Sapphire mine that sits deep in the CAZ.But for locals, it is a normal journey. We pass Julien, in his late 50s, who is coming back to get supplies. Most miners have sponsors, often Thai or Sri Lankan, but in some cases it is rumoured that government officials are involved. They provide miners with food, coffee and tools, and in return the miners sell the stones they find to them directly.Julien has lived at the mine for two years and will continue to go back, even though he has not found a single sapphire. Asked about conservation, he and his friends look nervously at the floor. There is no forest there any more, he tells me. But he adds enthusiastically: Where there is still forest, we will help to protect it.As you make your way deeper into the forest, accompanied by the calls of the Indri, one of the threatened species of lemur that lives there, the landscape is scarred with gold mines. We reach Tananarive – a mess of trenches in which the water runs a muddy brown and tree stumps smoulder on the hillside from a fresh area of burning – late in the afternoon.A community has sprung up, complete with a makeshift market and a church. People from all over Madagascar flooded into the area after that first sapphire discovery in 2016. Mr Rakoto left his life as a farmer. Others are miners by trade, while some are students trying to find a way to pay back their debts.Asma, in her late 40s, moved from the south with her husband and three sons and has called the mine home for four years. She has no plans to leave, especially after a 26-gramme sapphire was found at the end of December.There is no conservation here at the mine, she tells me in near perfect English. I don\u0027t know about a project, but some of the people are bad. They chop down and burn the trees so that they can grow crops and build houses. And there are the lemurs right at the edge of the trees.But environmentalists are quick not to make villains of the miners, who are trying to make a living in tough conditions. Barry Ferguson, a researcher and activist who has worked in Madagascar for more than 20 years, says: The demonisation of artisanal mining is the worst thing that can happen to the people of Madagascar. They have resources and they need to use them.The economic viabilities of carbon offsetting are ridiculous. It is not £1.50 to offset the carbon for your flight – it is more like £150.The Madagascan government echoes those concerns, with a spokesman for President Andry Rajoelina telling The : The whole world should understand that, despite enormous efforts being made by the government, it is difficult to eradicate deforestation in countries like Madagascar if the population remains extremely vulnerable to climate risks.Developing and vulnerable countries need additional resources and adequate technologies to combat global warming and achieve sustainable development targets.The number of people living at the mine is less than it was at its peak, when an estimated 4,500 miners flooded in to try and find their fortune. But the population is steady, with new people arriving to take the place of those who move on. Mining is now the second biggest industry in the country after agriculture, employing an estimated two million people.By the time the sapphire rush began, the conservation project had been authorised to sell carbon credits on the voluntary market, where consumers can purchase offsets for their flights. Conservation International and Verra, which administers the verified carbon standard that authorises the credits for sale, point out that they were issued for the period between 2008 and 2012, before deforestation rates increased.They say they had already reduced those emissions and therefore the carbon credits still stand. Each project must put credits in a buffer from which they can be cancelled if, for example, a forest burns down. Anybody who purchased and retired those credits should continue to have confidence that their investment had a climate impact, a spokesman for Verra says.But this basis is one with which environmental campaigners have a particular problem, as it is estimated that a tree needs to stand for 100 years to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.Chris Lang, who founded REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) Monitor, says the fundamental problem is that while the release of greenhouse gases on a flight definitely happens, there is absolutely no way of guaranteeing that a forest will remain standing.He has been tracking offsetting projects for the last 11 years and says that, alongside fundamental flaws in the system, there have been a number of projects for which there is no monitoring. People have returned to a project after five years to find that the forest has gone.After illegal sapphire mining in Madagascar began, Conservation International pleaded with the government to take action. But there are allegations that local officials receive payments from miners, and one woman tells me that, when the army was called in to act, all the soldiers did was throw out European traders.A spokesman for President Rajoelina, who took office last year, says illegal mining has happened since the 1990s and the government is taking action to prevent it as well as launching a reforestation programme to plant 60 million trees.He adds that officials are taking a zero tolerance approach to corruption in Madagascar, which is still recovering from a coup a decade ago. Political instability and corruption are said to have an impact on many offsetting projects around the world – another reason campaigners say they cannot be used as an excuse to continue releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.An analysis of the CAZ shows that tree loss has accelerated in recent years. In the decade before 2016, losses stood at around 58 acres a year. In 2016, that rose to 205 acres, spiking at 426 acres in 2017. Conservation International does not hide the fact that deforestation has increased, but says it has dropped from a peak of 4.2 per cent and stood at 1.59 per cent in 2018.McKenzie Intelligence Services, which analysed the area on behalf of The  using Nasa and European Space Agency satellites, was able to detect significant areas of rainforest that had been cleared. Its team, which analyses vast areas of agricultural land for the global insurance industry, found that a substantial amount of the deforestation began around rivers and spread outwards.Not only has this resulted in large areas of forest being cut down and cleared, but we also have seen discolouration of these waterways, displaying a pale golden colour which is assessed to be sediment, soil and other contaminants getting into the water as a result of the cleared forest along the river banks, a spokesperson explains.This activity is not the first mining discovery in the corridor – rich in natural resources including gold and rubies – and experts say it will not be the last.The area has now been rolled into the government\u0027s Atiala Atsinanana programme, which will produce more credits that will again go to the World Bank – this time into the Forest Carbon Partnership Foundation. It is unclear what will happen to the credits once they have been generated, but they could be sold to the airline industry to form part of its offsetting plan, which comes into effect this year.The World Bank says all its projects adhere to rigorous requirements and account for net reductions over an entire area after taking into account emission increases in parts of the project.  The government is studying whether there will be any duplication between the two carbon credit projects and insists there will be no unfair model.Agustin Silvani, the head of conservation finance at Conservation International, says: Without this kind of funding, the situation in the CAZ would be a lot worse. We are definitely having an impact.But one thing is clear. While carbon offsetting might be the latest gold rush in the West, the sapphires are the real prize for the people of Madagascar.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/20/TELEMMGLPICT000225373468_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqFmZwAHfbzbyjsBBHX-5Jh1FxexswdJIn0JCwl6ikJB0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"europe uneasy migration wont say","story":"Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives to give a statement to the media at the Chancellery following the Hanau shootings. Europe is uneasy about migration but won’t say whyOn Thursday, a middle-aged German called Tobias Rathjen drove to two shisha bars in Hanau, near Frankfurt, and shot dead nine people, all from immigrant backgrounds. He then went home and shot himself and his mother.That evening, huge, multi-racial crowds gathered to hold vigils and Germany’s president declared: “We want to live together.”Meanwhile, political recriminations began flying. The Left blamed the nativist AfD party. Some on the Right argued that Rathjen was a mentally ill loner whose actions mean nothing.He was certainly a delusional inidual. His online activity includes posting a video claiming that the US is controlled by “invisible secret societies” who “kill little children”. Given that his manifesto called for the annihilation of Arab states and Israel and the repopulation of the earth by half a billion “racially pure” Germans, however, it seems a little disingenuous to suggest that extremist, nativist ideologies are completely irrelevant to this event. The German far-Right, we should recall, is by far the country’s biggest source of fatal terrorist activity, whether it is against Jews, Turks, Kurds or pro-migration politicians.The fact is that Rathjen’s act was dressed in ideology. Fellow adherents range from Norwegian mass-murder Anders Breivik to Brenton Tarrant, the Australian who killed 49 in a rampage at a New Zealand mosque. Like Isil’s apocalyptic creed, this doctrine relies on a theory of epic conflict, in which its murderous acolytes are the brave foot soldiers. The core is an idea called “The Great Replacement”, which argues that the white, European peoples of the world are being systematically “replaced” by an “invasion” of brown and black peoples, amounting to an all-out assault on European religion, culture and racial identity.The custom, at this point, is to shut down the discussion by declaring that such ideas have no place in modern society and must be ruthlessly stamped out. And where they lead to terrifying, murderous rampages, as in Hanau, that is clearly right. But perhaps it would be more productive to say something true and uncomfortable as well. My hunch is that most people worried about racial change are not violent maniacs. Most of them are ordinary Europeans. In fact, I am willing to bet that if we probed the depths of Europe’s soul, we would find that this is a widely shared, largely unspoken anxiety harboured by millions of people.There is a code for talking about this subject. For understandable reasons, it is taboo to express doubts about racial ersity, a taboo broken by Andrew Sabisky, the Downing Street aide who quit this week. But the taboo does not eliminate people’s doubts. When people fret about Islam, for example, many of them are not thinking just about culture or religion, but race.The problem with the domineering, “liberal” response to this issue is that it involves ignoring some quite large facts. The biggest is that Europe is undergoing a profound shift in population. In the last 30 years, western European countries have seen enormous growth in the proportion of their population that was born abroad. In the UK it went from 6 per cent in the mid-1990s to 14 per cent in 2018. In Spain, it has grown from 3 per cent to 14 per cent, in Germany from 11 per cent to 16 per cent and in France from 7 per cent in the late-1990s (earliest comparable OECD data) to 12 per cent.These figures underplay people’s experience of change, because once here, migrants’ children are obviously counted as natives, when some people may not see it that way. Yes, there has always been migration, but by historic standards, this is a lightning-fast shift. At present, we are barely allowed to admit this is happening, let alone address the fact that people are anxious about it. In this vacuum, ideas like the “great replacement” flourish, providing ample fodder for the paranoid, violent and hateful.What is happening is, in fact, not a great replacement. It is a “great mingling”. White Europeans are not being effectively driven from their lands by a ruthless “white genocide”, as argued on certain niche forums. We are living alongside other races and religions, mixing with and changing one another. The population of Europe in one or two hundred years will probably be a new mixture, perhaps called something like “modern west Eurasians” by geneticists.Given the enormous potential for ethnic strife, as Germany has seen, the situation calls for European societies first, to admit this is happening and, secondly, decide whether or how to do something about it. It seems obvious that it would be wise to slow down the change, using whatever levers we have, which is one reason why the debate over immigration cannot simply be a question of whether care homes have enough workers. But the mingling is, at this point, inevitable. The question is how we manage it.One urgent task is for Europeans to address the weakness, perhaps even sickness, in our own culture. The ever-mutating barrage of self-hating, anti-patriotic fury and its flipside, the self-pitying, angry, white nationalist “involuntary celibate” types, of which Rathjen was one, are both disastrous.But more moderate advocates of British cultural identity are also to blame. If students raise the issue of colonisation, for example, our response should be to debate our history using facts, rather than wagging fingers or mouthing timid praise of the British Empire. Foreign cultural influence can and should help us to revive our own history and see it through a new lens. The most patriotic gathering I have ever attended was a dinner to celebrate the granting of British citizenship to a friend from the other side of the world. It would have given  readers a heart attack.We also need to know where to draw the line. Reasonable people should be able to listen calmly to those who say change is too fast, undesirable and is tearing our social and political fabric. They should be able to debate political tensions between Islam and Christianity.What cannot fly is the idea that people who live here as legal citizens, who were born on this continent, “do not belong here”, because of their religion, race or any other reason. To make such a claim about Islam, an infinitely erse religion of 1.8 billion people, as Germany’s AfD does, is a dead end. The only logical conclusion to draw from such a statement is that its practitioners must either leave, convert or be annihilated. That is the conclusion drawn by people like Breivik, Tarrant and, now, Rathjen, with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, it will not be the last time.Alternative for Germany (AfD)The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Total spending, including capital investment, rose by 5.5 per cent. The current budget in the fiscal year so far was in deficit by £7.2bn.Under the fiscal rules set by former chancellor Sajid Javid, who resigned earlier this month, the government must balance the current budget over three years, although borrowing for infrastructure is allowed up 3 per cent of GDP, which would allow an extra £22bn of public sector net investment a year.“While the current fiscal rule, would still allow a large rise in public investment, the rise in the deficit makes the ambition of balancing the current budget deficit more restrictive,” said Andrew Wishart, a UK economist at analysts Capital Economics.Mr Sunak said this week he would stick with the 11 March date for the government’s first post-Brexit Budget, ending speculation that the plans, which are likely to entail a big increase in spending, would be delayed.Philip Shaw, the chief UK economist at Investec, said the critical factor for next month’s Budget would be how much fiscal headroom there was to raise spending further beyond the plan for 2020-21 that Mr Javid set out last September.“The Conservatives’ manifesto committed the party to balancing the current budget during this parliament,” he\u0026nbspsaid.Mr Shaw added\u0026nbspthat how much room Mr Sunak had depended on precisely how this was defined, for example, which specific year in the parliament was used.“Our guess is that although there will not be much space for fiscal generosity, the chancellor will find some,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But attempts to discover it turned up nothing, until the latest discovery.Now researchers say they have found signs of oxygen in a galaxy called\u0026nbspMarkarian 231, 560 million lightyears away. That galaxy lies in the constellation Ursa Major and was already notable because it contains a bright quasar, where gas is swirled around a black hole\u0026nbspand glows visibly through the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as being the site of the first ever detection of breathable oxygen outside of our galaxy, Markarian 231 contains the most oxygen ever seen outside of our own solar system.Astronomers from China\u0027s Shanghai Astronomical Observatory were able to spot signs of oxygen using radio telescopes on Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

That is the signal for O2 in its breathable form, leading researchers to that they had made the\u0026nbspfirst detection of extragalactic molecular oxygen, as they write in the paper published in the Astrophysical Journal.Nasa could find alien planets that host life after new breakthroughOxygen is so hard to see from Earth because many of the signals that would alert us to it are absorbed by Earth\u0027s atmosphere. The new discovery was possible in part because the light is redshifted as it travels through space, allowing it to be stretched out into a wavelength that could more easily get through the atmosphere.While the gas is present in\u0026nbspMarkarian 231 in the form that humans breathe, actually travelling there and breathing it would not be possible. The swirl of gases present in the atmosphere does not have the same makeup as it does on Earth, and those other gases are required to allow humans to breathe in oxygen.But the discovery offers an important way of tracking how O2 interacts with such extreme astrophysical areas, the scientists write, and further examination of the galaxy could allow us to learn about how oxygen is present through the rest of the cosmos.And it also suggests that we may be able to find more oxygen, elsewhere in the universe. New equipment could be used to find oxygen elsewhere in the universe, the scientists involved write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the power’s there. We\u0027ve moved the engine but we haven\u0027t moved the user interface framework. We’ve made sure to lift the metaphors that we really want to keep alive on the iPad.”The initial release of Photoshop for iPad was met with mixed reviews, to which Adobe responded with a blog post insisting that the company was listening and detailing some of the changes that were on the way.Photoshop mistake shows Australian PM with two left feetTo celebrate the thirtieth birthday, Adobe has just announced new features for the desktop version, such as improvements to lens blur effects, performance improvements to discover a “more buttery and seamless mouse experience.”For the iPad version, the new elements include type settings, which addresses earlier worries users had, and an object selection tool which was only released for the desktop version a few months ago. In other words, the iPad version is adding desktop features, and fast.\u0026nbspBack to Lamkin: what does he mean when he refers to metaphors?“Well, take something as fundamental to Photoshop as masking, he says.\u0026nbspTo mask a layer on the desktop product is something that you can approach in three or four different ways. Do we want to offer three or four different approaches on the iPad? I don\u0027t think so.The metaphor of layer masks is something that\u0027s really critical to compositing. How do we reveal that in a way that is appropriate for that device and appropriate for new classes of customers?”One way of keeping things simple for newcomers is the way Adobe progressively reveals functionality. “Sure, as opposed to having 12 different options show up in the menu bar, we express things in a way that\u0027s more appropriate for the device and the users who are going to come to that for the first time on the iPad.”Is that Photoshop newbie the customer who is Adobe’s main priority with iPad? Adobe has made a big focus on accessibility and on different programs working together, so is accessibility or integration more important?Lamkn pauses and says:\u0026nbsp“I\u0027d say our top two priorities are building a great multi-surface workflow for Photoshop customers and paying close attention to established Photoshop customers who want to add a touch device to their workflow, to be able to work anywhere, regardless of what device they\u0027re working on. But we also want to acquire new customers who are really primary to that device. We don’t want to make any horrendous trade-offs in our iPad implementation of the product.”It’s a journey, then, which is also a useful response to some of those initial reviews. “We\u0027ve chosen to really focus on enabling the key workflows and use cases that are the most compelling out of the gates and to add additional use cases as we go, as opposed to trying to boil the ocean and deliver everything all at once until we understand how people actually use it.”With something like Photoshop that’s been going for so long, creating that blank canvas must be quite a daunting part of the design with the new iPad version.Lamkin nods. “Oh, it’s a heavy lift. We\u0027ve been at we\u0027ve been at it for three-and-a-half years. A lot of experimentation with how much risk do we take in delivering a new experience at the risk of not fully satisfying the existing customer base. It\u0027s not something we took lightly and it\u0027s something that the team worked for a couple years to get to.”Finally,\u0026nbspLamkin talks about\u0026nbspthe person coming to Photoshop for the first time on the iPad. What would he want the first big takeaway from trying Photoshop on the iPad to be?“Approachability and delight,” he says. “It\u0027s like I open this up and within 10 minutes I’ve familiarized myself with the application and the language and how I need to approach it to get the most out of it and I\u0027m delighted by what I can do just out of the gate.I want users to after 10-15 minutes session have done something that they\u0027re proud of. I’m not saying that they\u0027re going to learn the whole application, but they’ll say, hey, I understand how layers work and I\u0027ve been able to do a composite and, boom, I got something magical I just created.Creativity should be light, there should be a lightheartedness in this application too. There should be a sense of discovery as you\u0027re exploring, and the tools need to facilitate that by getting out of the way. That\u0027s our goal, to build tools that get out of the way.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our society is more ided than any of us would like,” he said.“Most people would like to feel more connected with their neighbours and people in their community. But rebuilding a more connected society will take action at all levels — from the Government and institutions to communities and iniduals too. There is a public appetite for us all to play our part in ensuring we turn this around.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile at the UK level, trust in national government fell by 11 percentage points in the year to autumn 2019 to just 21 per cent. The finding is likely to reflect growing public anger at the failure of the government and parliament to agree a deal on Brexit during 2017 and almost all of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will perhaps become more generally settled by the middle of March, with more prolonged dry spells possible, especially in the south.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are going to be single males travelling on their own. If you are travelling with a family of kids, on you go the chances you are going to blow them all up is zero.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“You can’t say stuff, because it’s racism, but it will generally be males of a Muslim persuasion. Thirty years ago it was the Irish. If that is where the threat is coming from, deal with the threat.”The Muslim Council of Britain said in a statement: “These comments are openly racist. He openly advocates against ‘males of a Muslim persuasion’, which presumably is not based on specific intelligence but solely whether someone ‘looks or acts like a Muslim’.Created with Sketch.Ryanair unveils its latest plan to save money: remove toilets from the plane Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“This is the very definition of Islamophobia.

Many studies have highlighted that Muslims in the UK, US and elsewhere already experience discriminatory treatment from airport security and police, and sometimes from fellow passengers.We know from research that Muslims are often racially profiled at airports but it is the brazen nature of the comments by Michael O\u0027Leary that are really disturbing. The comments are also really irresponsible when we consider that Muslims already suffer the majority of faith-based hate crime.These comments will only help to encourage Islamophobia, and will do nothing at all to prevent terrorism, he added.Mr O’Leary is no stranger to controversy, having previously said “shoot them” in reference to environmentalists and travel agents, and called obese people “monsters”.He also stirred anger nationwide after suggesting passengers should pay to use toilets on flights and even pushed proposals to remove two of the three lavatories on each plane so they could be replaced with seats.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Effectively we have a men-only block of 90 peers – 92 to be strictly accurate – in the House of Lords and that can’t change quickly as most of the hereditary peerages can only travel down through the male line.”\u0026nbspThe Labour peer is\u0026nbspconfident of his chances of success, despite the recent appointment of Lord True as the minister for constitutional reform, who has previously opposed efforts to phase out elections for those with inherited titles.Lord Grocott said: “I’m optimistic because I know that I’m 100 per cent, no argument, no doubt, right.”Campaigners said it was “absurd” that aristocrats were given guaranteed representation in parliament in the modern era, branding the system “beyond rotten”.Moving the House of Lords has nothing to do with serving the northWillie Sullivan, ERS senior director of campaigns, said: “A couple of hundred men of the landed gentry get to pick a sizeable chunk of the Lords to vote on our laws for life – and not a single ordinary voter has a say.“The system is beyond rotten, and is one of many reasons the Lords looks like a private members’ club rather than a serious scrutiny chamber.”He urged peers to support the bill as a small modernising step, adding: “Failing to back this modest change would be a spectacular own goal for both ministers and the 800-odd Lords.“Sadly each time this bill has been put forward it has been blocked by hereditary aristocrats – a reflection of the disproportionate influence they still hold.”It comes amid a fresh row over plans to give peers a tax-free pay rise in April, hiking their daily allowance up from £313 to £323.House of Lords reform\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We must differentiate between the two.”Ms Patel later told BBC Radio 5 Live that her parents had faced persecution in Uganda, pointing out that the changes she is introducing do not affect the way in which the UK will deal with people fleeing persecution overseas.“This is not about changing rules on asylum and refugees\u0026nbspand people that are being persecuted around the world – the two are fundamentally different so I think it is wrong to conflate the two,” said the home secretary. “My family were persecuted in East Africa so there is a complete difference between the two.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In 2018 he even said he believed Mr Putin’s denials over his own officials when the two men appeared at a news conference in Helsinki.Some commentators have argued that Moscow’s real goal is to sow ision and undermine the idea of democracy rather than to back one specific candidate.Federal investigators\u0026nbspcharged 13 Russians in 2018 over a covert social media campaign that prosecutors said was aimed at iding public opinion on controversial\u0026nbspsocial issues as well as propping up Mr Sanders and then-candidate Mr Trump while also denigrating Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee.Biden attacks Sanders over ‘immoral’ gun immunity in Las VegasDemocrats made a grave error by ignoring Sanders at the debateSanders campaign says demand for medical records similar to birtherismBernie Sanders ‘nearly ran against Obama in 2012’Sanders surges into double-digit poll lead in race to face TrumpAccording to the indictment, those behind the campaign circulated an outline of themes for future social media content, with instructions to “use any opportunity to criticise Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump –\u0026nbspwe support them)”.On Friday\u0026nbspMr Trump told supporters at a rally in Las Vegas that he heard Democrats were trying to “start a rumour ... that Putin wants to make sure I get elected”.“Listen to this, so doesn’t he want to see who the Democrat is going to be? Wouldn’t he rather have, let’s say Bernie?”The president mentioned that Mr Sanders and his wife\u0026nbspJane\u0026nbspspent their honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988.The Associated Press contributed to this reportShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Godfather 2 is the exception, not the rule. With their small budgets, bad actors, terrible scripts, sequels are often a disappointment. The issue is that they are so often the product of money-grabbing film execs, less concerned about making a good movie than trading off the success of the original.\u0026nbspWe would all be better off if studios focussed on making something new rather than trying to insert life back into what’s gone before. Let the detective stay dead, leave the couple at the wedding altar, let that airborne virus remain in remittance. Ignore the investor whispering in your ear: the monstrously big shark does not need to eat more tourist’s legs off.\u0026nbspPeople never learn. A sequel to romantic classic PS I Love You is currently in development. No, you won’t have to watch Hillary Swank lose her husband twice, nor does he come back from the dead. But you will have to endure more tragedy PS I Love You’s sequel will see Holly helping the terminally ill write to their loved ones.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPS No One Loves a Sequel. To prove it here is the most unnecessary examples on record.Click through the gallery below to see the list.Created with Sketch.The 27 worst film sequels of all time Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film. In place of a funny script and a decipherable plot, the sequel shoves in endless celebrity cameos. Skrillex, Susan Boyle and Justin Bieber are one of the 39 celebrities that appear in the film, but the force of star power fails to make Zoolander 2 enjoyable.227 I Still Know What You Did Last SummerAn island getaway becomes the setting of predictable kills and lazy thrills in this sub-par slasher. Jennifer Love Hewitt, haunted by the events of the first film, leads a cast running for their lives. The implausibly gullible teen characters still scream, the red herrings are still obvious, and we still know how it’s all going to end.Jaws 2 sees the great white original reduced to a lukewarm b-movie filled with bad special effects and clumsy editing. The only positive thing about Jaws 2 is that all the characters are so annoying that it’s actually pretty satisfying watching them get eaten alive. See also Jaws 3, 4 and 5.He might have been a crazed narcissist, but Patrick Bateman deserved better than this sequel. Thankfully, no one actually remembers that American Psycho 2 exists, or that Mila Kunis is the lead, which is good because it ruins the ambiguous ending of the original film. No amount of peppermint sheet masks could ever clean this mess of a movie up. Deciding to leave Baby in the corner, Havana Nights shares little with the original Dirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze’s simmering dance instructor becomes a charisma deprived pool boy. Our heroine has been replaced by an uptight WASP and worst of all there’s no overhead lift. Your eyes will be left hungry for more.Even if you don’t like James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning behemoth, it’s hard to forget the iconic image of a ship and its passengers meeting their watery doom. The digital effects of Titanic II, however, look like a child’s version of the original’s visuals. The plot – about a boat literally named Titanic II that takes its maiden voyage 100 years after the first – is equally creaky.Ten years after the original film, Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason fill in for Paul Newman and Robert Redford in this heist remake. Considering the movie’s clumsy mobster dialogue and slow-moving plot, the audience in 1983 might have felt like they were the ones who had really been hoodwinked.827 Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2The original Blair Witch changed the face of horror forever, inspiring hysteria with its cheap but innovative found-footage hook. Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 has better production values, but manages to be far less clever. A group of students visiting the first film’s location find themselves in danger, and the plot unravels from there.John Rambo is stripped of any the nuance he had in the first film, becoming an all-American macho cliche and increasing his body count through cartoonish violence. The ex-soldier tears through Vietnam to rescue American prisoners of war as a one man army, seemingly impervious to bullets or logic. If the absurd plot doesn’t jar for you, the politics probably will.Given the global recession that hung over this follow-up to the original 1987 Wall Street, director Oliver Stone could have made a far more interesting and timely film. A cast including Michael Sheen and Shia LaBeouf provide diminishing returns in a tale of greed that ultimately pulls its punches.1127 Weekend at Bernie\u0027s 2You may ask yourself how it’s possible to make a sequel to a film based on two friends pretending a corpse is still alive in order to party. The makers of Weekend at Bernie’s 2 were probably asking themselves the same thing in 1993. This tired comedy never crosses over from stupid into funny, despite many of the cast returning to try and recapture the dubious magic.The sequel to Donnie Darko toys with the concept of time, by wasting yours. The dialogue is awful, the acting wooden, and you don’t even get to see an angsty black haired Jake Gyllenhaal in all his blue-eyed glory. Director of the original, Richard Kelly, was so offended by S. Darko he described the experience of watching it as “horribly violating”.Robert De Niro’s reputation continued to devalue with the third installment of the Meet The Parents series. The title indicates how much effort was put into this family comedy, which relies on under-the-belt hits to wring any laughs out of its audience.This follow-up to the flashy 2013 film squanders the only reason it would have a sequel, and somehow is not named Now You See Me Now. The sleight-of-hand magic here is all style and no substance, and the endless overcomplicated reveals of characters tricking each other become very irritating.Mulan is a gender-bending, brave heroine who refuses to conform to society\u0027s expectations of her. That is, until she reappears in the Disney sequel as a devoted wife who is more than willing to comply with her husbands demands. Now even her pet dragon Mushu doesn’t like her. 1627 Son of the MaskJim Carrey is replaced by Alan Cumming in this low-budget comedy sequel, which manages to be both frantic and boring at once. Director Lawrence Guterman tries to make up for the lack of Carrey’s signature comedic vim by adding a baby and a dog, but their antics can’t distract from the ugly production design.Danny and Sandy flying off into the sunset should have been the end of Grease. But money-hungry film execs brought us back to Rydell High for sequel fans were hopelessly undevoted to. I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was, said Sandy stand-in Michelle Pfieffer years later. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better.1827 Dumb and Dumber ToStupider even than its title, the Farrelly brothers’ sequel puts its stars (Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels) through an overlong retread of past material. The broad humour feels decades out of date, and the energy that propelled the original through its juvenile jokes is gone. It’s hard to imagine who was the target audience for these gross-out sight gags.Hitchcock’s 1963 film The Birds was a masterclass in suspense. The birds that menace Tippi Hedron and the other inhabitants of Bodega Bay become genuinely disturbing through a slow, atmospheric build of tension. This made-for-TV sequel has the same avian threat, and some of the same cast, but none of the classic thrills.Sharon Stone had bad instincts when she agreed to this film. Even a new take on her iconic leg-crossing interrogation scene couldn’t save this sequel from one of the worst rotten tomato ratings on record. It managed to make less than $6m Stateside on a $70m budget.Amy Adams tries her best to tear into her role as a sadistic, sex-obsessed bully but the script for Cruel Intentions 2 – strictly speaking, a prequel, but sssh – is so bad that even she failed to save it. When her stepbrother Sebastian moves into her Mum’s Manhattan mansion, she barges into his shower and warns him, no one is going to threaten my cushy life. What teenager would ever say cushy life? Did a Mean Girls sequel happen if Tina Fey wasn’t around to write it? No, no it did not. A Plastics vs nerds turf war in the pits of the high school jungle just doesn’t work without Fey’s tight one-liners. In Mean Girls 2 we hear none of the “on Wednesdays we wear pink” “that\u0027s why her hair is so big. It\u0027s full of secrets” “you can’t sit with us” zingers that made the original film so magical. Although the soundtrack had its fans, this film is essentially a remake of the 1980 original without one half of the titular Blues Brothers (John Belushi died in 1982). Bafflingly, he is replaced by a 10-year old child in sunglasses. It’s half as funny and nowhere near as infectiously fun, but if you only care about the music, that might not matter.Infamous for ruining what would have been, in many critics’ eyes, a perfect trio of movies, The Godfather Part III delivers a slow anti-climax. The film has its defenders, but given the calibre of the first two Godfathers, this last instalment is the black sheep of the family.A young Hilary Swank stars in the fourth Karate Kid film, a precursor to the modern trend of rebooting ailing franchises with a female lead. Pat Morita as Mr Miyagi is charming as always, but the script is mostly recycled. There are a couple of interesting differences: Swank has a pet hawk, Buddhist monks dance to the Cranberries, and there’s almost no fighting. But what’s a Karate Kid sequel without the Kid or the karate?It might be called Staying Alive, but you won’t want to after watching this sequel. Six years after our hero Tony Manero made white polyester bell bottoms popular, we check back in on him as he auditions for a new Broadway musical called Satan’s Alley. There are far too many romantic subplots, oiled up chests and loincloths to make this film okay. Keanu Reeves wisely didn’t pick up the phone for this Razzie-winning action thriller. The speeding bus rigged by a bomber in the 1994 film is bizarrely replaced by a cruise ship here, making the action a lot slower and more boring. Poor Sandra Bullock is given nothing interesting to do, and surely must have been tempted to look for a lifeboat. Like a reliable friend – or a movie franchise worth millions of dollars – Zoolander returned for another film.

Will this plan do much to bring down the overall immigration numbers as the Tories have long promised EXTINCTION Rebellion “activists” who dug up a lawn at Cambridge University are nothing more than virtue-signalling thugs.If lads from a local estate were caught vandalising such hallowed grounds, they’d be roundly rebuked. But some — thankfully not the cops, who have made two arrests — want to make excuses for the children of middle-class dons.We sympathise with the general cause: recent floods are a timely reminder that action on climate change can’t wait.But how does destroying the hard work of grafting gardeners win over anyone to their side If Extinction Rebellion activists want to make themselves useful, they can head up North and help out with Storm Dennis relief efforts.If not, they should skedaddle before they embarrass themselves any further.NEW Conservative MP Ric Holden is bang on the money: the toilet tax takes the... proverbial. Because of a weird loophole in the law, public toilets are liable for business rates.That means councils which own public toilets have to stump up the considerable cost of running them — and a whacking great tax on top of that.Councillors don’t like their precious cash being sucked down the pan, so are falling over each other to shut them.And the results have been disastrous for those with medical issues that make public lavs a godsend.According to the Royal Society of Public Health, one in five people don’t leave their homes as often as they would like to because they can’t be confident of finding a loo when they need one.If Rishi Sunak is looking to prove he’s got his head screwed on, scrapping the toilet tax would be a good place to start.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are simply stunning.It’s no wonder that the Greeks want them to be ed to Athens while we want to keep them.They are on display for free in the British Museum, and I would urge you to pay them a visit.You cannot help but be moved by the amazing level of craftsmanship and imagination embodied in them.The outstanding sculptures depict, in expressive detail, rippling muscles, bulging veins, fluttering robes, the flaring nostrils of horses and the upward swing of a bull’s head in a flowing, dynamic composition that reveals the extraordinary skill of their creators.They have inspired artists in their depiction of the human and animal form since they were rediscovered in the th Century.To have them here in Britain, in the care of the British Museum since , is an enormous privilege, never to be taken for granted.We are lucky that Lord Elgin found them and made a deal with the local Ottoman rulers at the time to bring so many of them back to the UK in the early s.At the time, the Parthenon was no longer the awe-inspiring temple it had been.In fact, it had been badly damaged in an explosion in , and when Lord Elgin took them, many of the marbles were little more than rubble.Since being housed in the British Museum, among other stunning treasures from the ancient world, public understanding of their signicance has grown.They continue to inspire anyone who sees them with a sense of what human beings can achieve in the application of knowledge, imagination and skill.At the British Museum, which is legally obliged to care for them in perpetuity, they can be visited and studied by adults, children and young people from all over the country.Not all of us will be lucky enough to travel to Greece in our letime but your mind can wander there by seeing the Elgin Marbles in London.And it is important that our kids continue to do this, because it opens up the history of the world and art.It is not just Brits either. London is one of the most accessible cities in the world, easy to reach from across Europe and where.People from around the globe visit the museum and learn what we share in common, and how humans have interpreted the world through their artefacts.We should resist the claim that artefacts belong where they were made, not least because it denies historical truth.Throughout history, artefacts have been traded across the world, often to the benefit of the people who created them, sometimes to their detriment. History is complicated and often not to our liking.The Parthenon was built long before modern Greece existed — when the region was made up of warring cities ided by arid mountains.Those who built the Parthenon had no notion of nationhood. Their concern at the time would have been to show off their city.How proud they would have beenthey could have foreseen the reverence with which their creations are held today around the world.The fact that the DNA of their descendants is now likely to have spread worldwide only reinforces the point that the geographical origin of the Marbles carries little objective signicance.Giving in to repatriation demands will undo the real achievements of cultural history in showing that more unites us than ides us. The amazing thing about the flowering of knowledge about the world in the th and th Centuries was that it created an awareness of human potential — a sense of what we could achieve in the arts and sciences.The Marbles symbolise this achievement — they opened up horizons and revealed new possibilities for human thought and action.Maintaining this sense of openness remains as important now as ever.In today’s globalised world, it’s tempting to think that people can see anything via the internet,not physically.But we must fiercely guard our museum collections, which remain the most accessible way for properly engaging with history.The Government is right to refuse to include the Elgin Marbles in any deals with the EU.They should never be used as political capital to serve the interests of European elites.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is cheaper to buy, but contains moisture and when burned gives off more smoke and pollution than dry wood.It is also harder to set alight, and dficult to burn.Burning wet wood can also lead to a build-up of soot and sticky creosote inside of the burner.Dry wood has usually been dried out in a kiln and has a moisture content of % or less.If you are chopping your own wood to burn, it will need to be dried out for around a year in order to be classied as dry. Some types of wood, such as oak, will require longer.Pieces of wet wood will make a dull thud when knocked together, while you can spot dry wood by looking for cracks, a dull colour and loose bark. The logs will also feel lighter.Dry wood is not only better for the environment, but burning it gives off more heat - making it more efficient, while your stove will require less cleaning and maintenance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is already clear the UK and the EU are MILES APART on how any deal would work — and moving further away from each other.Brussels insists this country signs up to stringent rules on a “level playing field” and governance before the talks can proceed. This means they want the UK to agree to stick to a bunch of EU rules even after we have left.At the same time, they want a structure where the EU’s own institutions have a key role in decidingthe UK is doing this or not.The EU view is that the UK will ultimately agree to these demands because the EU is so much bigger.One figure on the European side dismisses the idea that the UK and the EU are “sovereign equals”, pointing out that the EU has a population of million to our million.They think economic reality and the threat of long queues of lorries at Dover will lead to the UK backing down.But the Government is not going to do that. It thinks agreeing to these restrictions would destroy the whole point of Brexit: Our ability to do things dferently.Boris Johnson has been praising chief negotiator David Frost’s speech making this point as “magnicent” to anyone who’ll listen.If the EU insists on these preconditions in the opening round of negotiations, scheduled for the first week of March, the Government will dismiss the talks as pointless.Inside No, they believe Brussels does not realise how much has changed since the General Election.One source tells me: “The EU, understandably, are treating this negotiation like the previous one. But our hand is much stronger because of the mandate we’ve been given by voters.”Downing Street hopes Frost’s speech this week will make the European side realise we are serious about not accepting EU preconditions.One insider points out that Boris Johnson needn’t have an election until  — so nearly every European leader would pay the price at the ballot box before he does for any economic disruption caused by the failure of negotiations.When I asked one Secretary of State why the Government was so adamant that everything had to be settled by the end of this year, I was told: “If there are hiccups, it is better for them to happen in Year One of a government, not Year Three.”It is not just on the future relationship that the UK and EU are heading for a row.A figure close to the negotiations says they are “starting to wake up in Brussels to the fact we have a totally dferent interpretation of the Irish protocol”, which covers arrangements for the Irish border.The appointments of Suella Braverman as Attorney-General and Brandon Lewis as Northern Ireland Secretary indicates the Government is preparing to take a robust approach.This will infuriate the EU side, which believes these arrangements have already been agreed.Interestingly, influential figures on both sides hope the blow-up in trade talks comes SOONER rather than later.Why  Because they think it is only once the two sides have realised just how far apart they really are that the serious negotiations can begin.DOWNING Street is acutely aware that one of the biggest dangers to this government is LOSING VOTERS’ TRUST.If people come to see this administration as just another bunch of politicians who don’t do what they said they would, then it is doomed.No also knows that Boris Johnson’s opponents love to attack him as “untrustworthy”.This didn’t hurt him too much at the election because voters regard most politicians as untrustworthy.Butthere was a clear and compelling example of him breaking his word to voters then that could change, and very quickly.This explains why the promises made in the Tory manesto are being treated as holy writ in government.There is a serious point to Boris’s cringe-making call and response with Cabinet ministers about how they are going to hire , more police officers.He knows they need to do this to show a sceptical electorate that he keeps his promises.During the campaign, he admitted that the questions about whether he keeps his word made his “blood boil”.The whole emphasis on promise-keeping is bad news for Heathrow and the third runway.In , Boris promised to lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop it being built. Sothe bulldozers move in on his watch it will be acutely embarrassing.You can just imagine the split screen of his comments and the ground being flattened – it would dramatise the whole trust issue.This is one of the reasons why I think the third runway won’t end up happening.If in the next few weeks the Mayor of London wins his judicial review against the decision to go ahead with it, I doubt the Government will appeal the verdict.But Patel is not the first Home Secretary to have dficult relations with him.Allies of Amber Rudd believed that Rutnam should have gone when she quit over the handling of the Windrush scandal, which was as much an institutional failure as a political one.Friends of hers believe one of the reasons why the review into it has yet to be published is that it makes clear that the institutional Home Office is to blame for what went wrong.The ministers keep changing but the Home Office has not been “fit for purpose” for some time.It is proof that effective government is going to require reform of Whitehall.I understand Trump spontaneously raises the issue with social confidants, as well as figures inside his administration. He complains about the “betrayal” it represents.It isn’t just Trump who is cross. A host of Tory MPs are still pushing No to give an indication as to when the  per cent cap on Huawei involvement in the G network will be reduced to zero.The question is whether Boris will have done anything to address these concerns before he heads to the US for the G summit and a meeting with Trump in JuneThe contest hasn’t captured the public’s imagination and it has mostly served as a reminder of how in hock Labour still is to Corbynite ideology.None of the three remaining candidates is proposing the kind of break from the Corbyn years that is needed.Until it can break these shackles, Labour won’t be a national party again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The social policy experts say the two-child limit - which has hit more than , kids in , families since it launched in  - is driving children to poverty and food banks. They also demand a cut to the five-week wait for Universal Credit in the March  Budget - warning the move could help thousands of people now and urging the Tories not to stand by. Twenty-three social policy university academics,  of whom are professors including from York, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Birmingham and Warwick, have written to Boris Johnson and new Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Their letter is also backed by  Labour MPs, the Unison, Unite, Usdaw and GMB unions, and local branches of foodbanks and Citizens Advice. Wirral South MP Alison McGovern, who organised the aposMaking Ends Meetapos campaign, said: The Tories have overseen a massive increase in food poverty over the past decade. Yet Boris Johnson said he wants the UK to be the greatest country on earth. He has the chance to lt kids out of poverty at the Budget in three weeksapos time - itaposs time the Conservatives did the right thing by ending the two-child limit and reducing waiting times for Universal Credit. Since April  families can only claim the child element of UC - £ a month - for their first two children. Despite an extension to children born before  being called off, the policy has hit the benefits of , families containing , children in its first two years. Scrapping the two-child limit would cost £billion per year in the long run.  That is the same amount the Tories will spend raising the National Insurance threshold from £, to £, this April - a move the IFS think tank says will mainly help middle and higher earners. And it is just a quarter of the £bn-a-year Boris Johnson pledged in his leadership campaign to spend on income tax for £, earners - a plan he later shelved. Meanwhile MPs and charities have demanded the five-week wait for familiesapos first Universal Credit payment is cut.

Removing the two-child limit in Universal Credit . Reducing the waiting time for Universal Credit Longer-term labour market changes to ensure parents and carers are supported at work as well as improvements to our mental health system are also required but these two first steps are essential and could help thousands of people now. The need for long-term change is not an excuse for standing by whilst the problem continues to get worse due to Government policy. The Budget on  March will be a test of whether the British people can trust the Government to change the country for the better. We urge the Government to use the Budget to help people make ends meet.

The new passport is due to have up-to-date security features and technologies to protect against fraud and forgery - but the pages will be plastic instead of paper, making it more dficult to alter.

A Home Office official pointed out the words aposUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandapos will still be on the same page lower down. The inside cover has a string of security features, including a seven-sided sideways photo cutout that appears to look like a drunk p of your own face.  In another change, the back cover will carry its own symbolic design – the floral embossed emblems of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “Leaving the European Union gave us a unique opportunity to restore our national identity and forge a new path in the world. “By ing to the iconic blue and gold design, the British passport will once again be entwined with our national identity and I cannot wait to travel on one.” The new passports will have updated security features, including a “hard-wearing, super-strength polycarbonate data page”.  Burgundy passports can still be used until they expire - but travellers are being warned to have at least six monthsapos validity leftthey visit the EU from  January . That is because current free movement rules will end and we will default to the stricter travel rules for certain countries outside the EU.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs underlying tensions with the palace have been laid bare in their latest bombshell statement. It comes after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed they will stop using the word royal throughout their branding after they step back from royal duties next month. In an extraordinary statement released on Friday, Prince Harry and Meghan hinted at the tense negotiations as they detailed the revised role they will be taking on in the next year. They also appear to complain about not being allowed to seek outside employment while remaining working members of the family, as is the case for some other titled members of the firm. The couple will no longer carry out royal duties as of March , although they will still receive police protection because of Harryaposs military service and Meghanaposs independent profile. They also said they no longer plan to launch their own foundation and have abandoned plans to trademark Sussex Royal, as per the Queenaposs request. Reports in the US suggested Meghan had told pals there was aposnothing legally stopping themapos from using Sussex Royal despite the Queenaposs ban. The Queen called on her senior legal advisers to outline the case enshrined in UK law banning the use of the word “royal” for financial gain, prompting their latest bombshell statement. It means they cannot use Sussex Royal on merchandising, despite having already spent thousands on doing just that on a range of goods from T-shirts to bandanas and literature. They will also have to choose a new name for their planned charitable foundation, which was due to use the label. But in their new statement, the couple claim the Monarchy and Cabinet Office had no jurisdiction over the use of the word aposroyalapos overseas. However, the Sussexes said they no longer plan to trademark aposSussex Royalapos. The statement, published on their official website sussexroyal, reads:It is agreed that the commencement of the revised role of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will take effect Spring  and undergo a  month review. The Royal Family respect and understand the wish of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to live a more independent le as a family, by removing the supposed ‘public interest’ justication for media intrusion into their lives. They remain a valued part of Her Majesty’s family.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will become privately funded members of The Royal Family with permission to earn their own income and the ability to pursue their own private charitable interests. The preference of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex was to continue to represent and support Her Majesty The Queen albeit in a more limited capacity, while not drawing on the Sovereign Grant.  While there is precedent for other titled members of the Royal Family to seek employment outside of the institution, for The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, a -month review period has been put in place.  Per the agreement The Duke and Duchess of Sussex understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties and not undertake representative duties on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen. As agreed and set out in January, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will retain their HRH prefix, thereby formally remaining known as His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex and Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer actively use their HRH titles as they will no longer be working members of the family as of Spring . As the grandson of Her Majesty and second son of The Prince of Wales, Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex remains sixth in line to the throne of The British Monarchy and the Order of Precedence is unchanged. It was agreed that The Duke and Duchess will no longer be able to formally carry out ‘official duties’ for The Queen or represent The Commonwealth, but they will, however, be allowed to maintain their patronages . It is agreed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son. This is based on The Duke’s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess’ own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specically over the last few years.

In a bid to spread a bit of community spirit and hopefully make people smile, Phil Tutton started attaching little wooden doors to trees around the Garden Village, Hull. By last July,  doors had appeared across the area, with dferent names written on them. They were also decorated with illustrations of animals, footballs and other colourful designs. Now Mr Tutton has received a complaint from someone concerned he is damaging the trees. I started putting the fairy doors up after getting the idea from a fairy sanctuary near York, he said. The first few were stolen so I screwed them to the trees and named the first few after a few of the local children I knew and it snowballed from there. So far, Iaposve had nothing but encouragement. There are a few celebrity ones too including the mayor of Hull and Peter Levy. The initial complaint surfaced yesterday [Thursday] about the damage to the trees but I pointed out that there was no more damage done by the doors than done by the nesting boxes on the same trees, then I was told that I didnapost have permission to put them there as itaposs a conservation area.  Mr Tutton turned to social media to air his grievances about the complaint. Since yesterday, Iaposve had hundreds of messages of support and encouragement so we wonapost let them win, he said. We have plans to make a slight alteration to the doors to satisfy the conservation officers, keep all the children and residents happy but hopefully still annoy the complainers. They [the person who contacted him from the council] have askedI would remove them from the trees but so far Iaposve said not yet as we have plans... They havenapost directly mentioned prosecution but they have said it was an offence to do what I did do I took that as a threat.  Mr Tutton has since decided to take the signs down. It hasnapost bothered me at all, he said. I kind of like upsetting miserable b****** and knowing that itaposs made almost everyone smile and enjoy going out for a walk in the fresh air with their children makes it all worthwhile.A spokeswoman for  Hull City Council said since said they have invited Mr Tutton to work with the council on any future projects.She said: Following complaints from residents, the council has requested the removal of the fairy doors from the trees in Garden Village.  Garden Village is a conservation area, and as such, all trees are protected under the Town and Country Planning Act . It is therefore an offence to attach anything to a tree that could cause damage. Having spoken to Mr Tutton, we understand he is planning to remove the doors within the next weekend and we would like to thank him for his cooperation. We have invited Mr Tutton to work with the council on any future projects. Mr Tutton told Hull Live although he will remove them he is adamant they will not leave the area. I told them [the council] that I would remove the doors from the trees but they will not be leaving the area, he said.

Sara Crosland, from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, was diagnosed with a rare Acoustic Neuroma brain tumour in February . But before being diagnosed Sara, , had only suffered from minor symptoms. Her symptoms ranged from chronic joint pain, fatigue, and double vision, to a a change in the sensation in her face.Walking also began to feel dferent but despite this Sara never expected to receive the news she did - reports Cheshire Live. She said: I was angry, upset, afraid, and yet numb. I remember asking the consultant what could be done about it as I wasnapost ready to check out just yet, as there was so much I still had to do. In May , the -year-old underwent a complex eight-hour surgery to remove the tumour at Salford Royal Hospital in Manchester. Whilst the surgery was a success - with all the tumour being removed - Sara was left profoundly deaf. The mum also had no balance on one side, leaving her unable to walk and needing intensive vestibular rehabilitation therapy. I’d been lying in a hospital bed, fully aware that the removal of my brain tumour would hopefully leave me with my le, but with no idea at what cost, including the possibility of losing the ability to walk unaided, said Sara.  Neuro fatigue is something Sara has to battle on a daily basis but despite this she has been determined to overcome the many challenges her illness has presented. By setting herself incremental goals, Sara has had many achievements since her surgery. She said: Ten weeks after my surgery I was on the summit of Y Garn in Snowdonia, and  days later, I was summiting North Africa’s highest peak, Jebel Toubkal, at ,m. Now, Sara, who is a professional photographer, is preparing for the Chester Half Marathon and a Lake District km Ultra Challenge in May and June, to raise money for Brain Tumour Research and the British Acoustic Neuroma Association . Professor Simon Lloyd, ENT at Salford Hospital, said: Sara has made an amazing recovery and has been a true inspiration to others since the surgery, in no small part because of her positive attitude and ability to keep going through adversity. She has clearly demonstrated that whilst this type of surgery can be very challenging to recover from, with the right approach you canto normal le without compromise. She is an amazing role model to those having to go through similar treatment. Through the charity events Sara hopes to be able to give something back to the charities that provided her with hope and support during an extremely dficult time and hopes to raise in the region £.

Philip Youngman, a -year-old farmer, believed he would get away with repeatedly abusing the girl but was convicted of a series of rapes and sexual assaults. The brave victim, who has since been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder, had to relive her ordeal by giving evidence in front of the jury. In an impact statement read to Newcastle Crown Court, she said: He has taken away my childhood innocence and left me a broken soul.  No words can express what he has done to me. Coming forward was one of the hardest things I have done in my le. Without support I wouldnapost have done it. At no point has he acknowledged what he did to me was wrong. He made me relive the abuse during the court case. No sentence can turn back the clock on my childhood andme to normal. I cannot get those years back. I will have to live with this for the rest of my le, with damaged mental health and twisted memories. After the guilty verdicts, the pervert said he may kill himself, depending on theof sentence he received. Jailing Youngman, Judge Robert Adams said he poses a high risk of serious harm to children. The judge told him: You continue to deny the offending behaviour. You say you plan to appeal against the convictions. You have demonstrated distorted thinking and harmful beliefs. You consider children as little adults capable of enjoying sex.  You have views of sexual entitlement. You believed you would get away with it. You have said you will kill yourself, depending on theof sentence. The judge ordered Youngman to sign the sex offenders register and abide by a sexual harm prevention order for le. Youngman was convicted by the jury of five offences of rape and seven of serious sexual assault, which happened on Tyneside, after a five-day trial. Tom Mitchell, defending, said Youngmanaposs crimes are never likely to be repeated again as he will be a much older man when he is released from jail. Mr Mitchell said Youngman of Broomsfield Brough, East Yorkshire, will be closely supervised when he is released due to the nature of the offences. After the case, Detective Constable Stefan Noakes, of Northumbria Policeaposs Safeguarding Department, said: The victim in this case has shown great courage in coming forward, not only to report this horric abuse at the hands of Philip Youngman but also in preventing any further victims. She was first targeted as a schoolgirl and so would have no real idea about what was going on.

After making his own escape bid by climbing through a loo window en route to a POW camp, he was sent to Stalag Luft III in . Now an academic says his “fiery” sermons in the camp motivated the breakout – even though his role in The Great Escape may not appear in the  movie with Steve McQueen. Dr Linda Parker said: “As chaplain he’d have been able to speak to the troops in confidence, to motivate them with the story of his escape attempt. “It was his view troops had a Christian duty to try and escapecaptured. His actions would have spread across the Army, inspiring others. It showeda humble padre could escape, so could they.” Nicknamed “Padre Mac”, the former boxing champion served as a chaplain with the Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders in Aruba, and with the st Parachute Brigade. After being captured he spent two and a half years in prison, mostly in the infamous Stalag Luft III, in Zagan, Poland. Years later he said: “To be a good minister one has to be tougher than a commando and a paratrooper. I know because I’ve been both.” He supervised and helped the men who dug tunnels out of the camp. Some  men escaped on March , . All but three were caught and  were executed. He said: “More than  of us wanted to escape. Just before I was due to go the Americans asked me to become their chaplain. My place was taken by a Dane. He was one of the  executed. I knew all those men. My best friend was among them. It was the saddest day of my le. “It was cleverly conceived and lethally executed but The Great Escape was a massive disaster.

Kaya Corbridge quit her degree in international relations to sell nude pictures and saucy videos of herself online. Raking in  times the average annual UK salary of £, at just , singleton Kaya owns her house in Colne, Lancashire, outright and holidays in far flung destinations such as Bali, Barcelona and Australia. Her luxury lestyle became possible after she quit her degree course in international relations and global development at Leeds Beckett University in September , after just four weeks, to focus on her OnlyFans account - a subscription service where content creators provide exclusive material to their subscribers, or fans. Kaya explained how her content - which fans pay a fee to view - can range from naked pictures to videos of her feet, saying: I set-up my OnlyFans account on a bit of whim. I just thought I’d give it a go – I never thought it would change my le in the way it has. “In my first year I made £, and now I earn about £, every month – I’m in the top one per cent of OnlyFans earners in the world. Le before her saucy endeavours was far from luxurious for Kaya - who also provides additional favours for fans, which can include rating pictures of menaposs intimate parts. Her previous jobs have included being a cash-in-hand waitress at , working in McDonaldaposs, Lidl and as a part-time tour operator. But now Kaya, who has a brother and two sisters who she prefers to keep anonymous, says money is no object, adding: Last year I bought my first house and paid for it outright. It cost £, and it’s lovely. Itaposs got two bedrooms, a kitchen, two bathrooms, a balcony and a garden and itaposs made me want to buy a second property soon. But Iaposm hardly there, as I spend most of my time travelling the world.  I love exploring and seeing new places and I love being my own boss, as I can still work from wherever I am in the world. Since I started OnlyFans I’ve visited  countries, I’ve taken my mum to Paris, Poland and Barcelona, and I spent a few months in Australia. I travelled in America, saw more of Europe, then went to Bali and now I’m travelling around South East Asia. Iaposm hoping to have been to  countries by the end of the year.OnlyFans content providers like Kaya have a photo feed, like Instagram users, showing pictures but she also takes private requests.For private requests people can pay for nude pictures and videos of me and some more naughty things, too, like strip teases. Thereaposs acalled Strip for Tip, and during a live video the more money my subscribers send me the more clothes Iaposll take off. “I usually post once a day - a mixture of pictures and videos - but the most time-consuming part of the job is making sure I reply to everyone’s messages. I can get hundreds in a day and it can take hours to reply to them all.” Despite her enviable curves, Kaya says many of her fans - who are mainly men but also some women and couples - just want to focus on her feet. She said: People have a real thing for feet. I’ve made thousands from mine!  Sometimes, they just ask for pictures of them - or theyaposll want videos of me rubbing oil on them, or of me just walking along in the sand. Itaposs easy money. Men also pay me to rate their privates. Theyaposll send me a pic, then Iaposll tell them what I think of it in exchange for money. Plus thereaposs the girlfriend experience. Men ask me to speak to them asIaposm their girlfriend for one day and pay me for it. I chat through messages or voice notes. Usually, theyaposll tell me what type of girlfriend they want me to be. Honestly, it would blow peopleaposs mindsthey heard what some men ask for - but I just let it go over my head. She has turned down some of her fansapos more lurid requests for items of worn underwear, to shave her hair off and, on one occasion, to put a slice of bread in her shoe, walk around on it all day and send a male admirer her crumbs. She also has fans who want to gt items to her, which she says can be very useful. Kaya, who did her own poll to determine the profile of her fans, which she believes are mostly men in their s or s, said: For fans who want to give me gts, I have a aposWish List.apos All I do is add items that I want to it, so they can go and buy them for me. I ask for all sorts, usually just boring every day items. My brother needed a new mattress recently, so I added it to my list, and someone bought it.  When I moved into my house, I asked for things like a kettle and microwave, as well as candles and cushions - and got those gted too. Iaposve also been given a phone, trainers, clothes, vouchers and books. Sometimes Kayaaposs fans use their initiative and buy her surprise presents. I get sent outfits that people want me to wear on camera, she said. Iaposve been sent a policewoman and a nurse outfit before, as well as a tutu, fishnet tights and a corset. I also had rope sent to me. I was just like, aposSo, what am I meant to do with this apos The next day a book arrived which was called aposThe Art of Rope Tying,apos so Iaposm guessing they wanted me to tie myself up in rope. Her fans can also help to maintain Kayaaposs immaculate appearance. “There’s acalled ‘Adopt a Billapos, she said. Using that, people can pay for me to get things like get my nails or toes painted.  “Orsomething crops up – likeI need to go to the dentist – they can pay for that, too. “I have extensions, which can cost a small fortune to maintain, so sometimes, I ask for contributions for my hair.” Looking back to September  when she first opened her account, Kayaaposs le now is unrecognisable. “For those couple of weeks when I was at university I was as poor as hell and could barely afford to eat,” she said. “I was always worried about money, my parents didn’t have a lot, but they scraped together all they could to give me an extra £ a week. “I remember being in tears because my laptop basically blew up and I couldn’t afford to fix it.Her le changed in an instant, however, when, browsing Twitter one day, Kaya found someone with an OnlyFans account and decided to follow suit and start her own.She said: I set it up, then forgot about it for a while. A few days later I uploaded a bikini picture of myself to see what happened. When I woke up the next day, I checked my account and Iaposd made £ overnight - I couldnapost believe it! After that, she continued to post intimate images and videos to the website.  Within the first month Iaposd made £,, she said. I knew I was on to something good, so I decided to quit my university course and concentrate on OnlyFans. To be honest, I only went to university because I wanted to get a charity job doing international aid. “Now I can volunteer for charities while still earning a wage through OnlyFans. So last year, one day I told my fans, ‘Whatever I earn today Iaposll donate to Pendle Dogs in Need’, which is a rescue and rehome centre, and I made over £, that I donated to them. She added: In January I volunteered at a dog rescue centre in Ko Samui in Thailand for a couple of weeks - I loved it, and I hope to do some more volunteering soon. Meanwhile, Kayaaposs online work is fully supported by her loved ones. “My family and friends are happy for me and so supportive of what I do,” she said. “I’ve been honest with them the whole time. As soon as I posted my first photo, I told them what I was doing.

With swathes of South Wales and northern and central England still trying to cope with the impact of Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis, heavy showers have brought new flooding plus warnings of more to come. Emergency crews were out last night out ferrying residents trapped in their vehicles in floodwaters to safety, and helping sandbag threatened properties in Englandaposs north. Meanwhile Wales is preparing for another onslaught of heavy rain tomorrow morning, after southern parts were hit by serious flooding over the past week. The Met Office said more belts of heavy rain were due on Saturday night and again on Sunday night across the UK, accompanied by warnings of high winds and snow in Scotland. The Environment Agency had  flood warnings in place this morning, as well as  flood alerts, covering areas from Wiltshire to Cumbria. And two severe flood warnings - meaning an imminent danger to le - remain in force for the River Lugg at Hampton Bishop, near Hereford. A yellow rain warning is forecast for flood-hit Wales, with persistent and heavy rainfall expected on Sunday morning.  The Met Office is warning more flooding of homes and businesses is possible for Wales. Prince Charles visited Pontypridd in South Wales yesterday after it was badly hit by the floods. It is estimated that , properties - both residential and commercial - have been affected in the Rhondda Cynon Taf area. Charles walked down Pontypriddaposs high street, where many shops are closed due to flood damage.  Heavy flooding was also reported in parts Englandaposs north last night. The village of Horton-in-Ribblesdale on the southern edge of the Yorkshire Dales was cut off by rising water on Friday night. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said on Twitter that a crew from Skipton had to pluck four people to safety overnight after their vehicle became trapped in floodwater. Rescue crews were also helping residents whose homes in Giggleswick were being hit by heavy flooding. Crews were in Settle, Grassington and Ribblesdale last night to defend the communities from the rising waters. North Yorkshire Police said the A between Gargrave to Settle was impassible due to flooding last night.  West Yorkshire Police reported problems on the same road between Ilkley and Burley on Saturday morning Motorists have also been warned to avoid Billams Bridge, in Otley, on Saturday. The damage wrought by Storm Dennis last weekend and Storm Ciara the week before is projected to run into the billions to repair. Although this weekend will bring bouts of rain, high winds and even snow in places, the Met Office said on Saturday the conditions did not merit classying the weather as a named storm.  Forecaster Marco Petagna said Saturday would bring a respite from the rain in some areas but there was a warning for high winds in the north and another band of stormy weather would sweep in from the South West on Saturday night. Mr Petagna said a yellow weather warning had been issued for rain in parts of Wales on Sunday with mm in total expected in some upland areas. He said another storm system would move across the whole of the UK on Sunday night with high winds, rain and snow across Scotland and parts of northern England. Caroline Douglass, director of incident management at the Environment Agency , said on Friday: This will be the third weekend of exceptional river levels and stormy weather.  With the effects of climate change, we need to prepare for more frequent periods of extreme weather like this. People need to be aware of their flood risk, sign up to flood warnings, make a flood plan and not to drive or walk through floodwater. The EA said that river levels have exceeded existing records, with the Colne, Ribble, Calder, Aire, Trent, Severn, Wye, Lugg and Derwent among the many rivers where records have been broken. But the agency said that, even with record river levels, the number of homes flooded has been lower than in other major flood events of the last  years.

The pair, who have a  year age gap, met on a website that puts women in touch with sugar daddies. But they say what started as a purely financial situation has now developed into true love - even though Grant is three years older than -year-old Sabrinaaposs dad. Sabrina, who is studying psychology and art therapy, loves to wear candy pink wigs and dresses in doll-like outfits. Meanwhile, Grant, , is semi-retired. Sabrina  said: I met Grant on the sugar daddy, sugar baby website initially for financial reasons. I thought I would just find a sugar daddy but now it’s for love, it’s not for money. “When society sees us walking they think, ‘Oh I wonder how much money he gives her, she’s only in it for the money’.” Grant added: “I was surprised to find true love online. I really didn’t expect it at all. He said: “In terms of being called a sugar daddy, I am a little bit anti being called that because of the men who have taken it in the wrong direction. Where itaposs just strictly money transfers for brief interludes of companionship, so thataposs really not my goal or direction, so Iaposm really not truly a sugar daddy.” Grant had dated other women he met on the site but admits he had mixed success. He says he would often “mostly just pay for dates” as well as trialling monthly allowance arrangements but the women “would disappear and reappear maybe the last day of the month. But both Sabrina and Grant say that when they met, they clicked instantly.  Sabrina explained: “It’s like any other relationship like anyone  my age or older, I’m really happy. We clicked right away. “We just got to know each other and the more we got to know each other the more that I just liked him as a person, it wasn’t superficial.” Grant added: “We kind of put money aside, we didn’t even care about money.” Sabrina says her relationship with Grant is completely dferent to sugar daddies she has met in the past. She added: Some men that I saw were unattractive, I wasn’t attracted to them so it was just about the money. He makes me so happy. He really does. Itaposs not transactional, itaposs not about money. He just treats me like a princess. He really does. And I tried to treat him like the diamond he is. So I try to respect him. So heaposs my diamond daddy. But not everyone approves of their relationship. Sabrinaaposs -year-old dad, who she lives with, has serious reservations.  She said: “Unfortunately my mom is no longer here, but my dad, he doesn’t approve. He’s still stubborn. He does not approve of it. I don’t really tell him a lot about it.“I noticedI post a picture of me and Grant on Facebook, my friends will like it but my family wonapost like the picture.”Grant was previously married and has three children himself and although they know about how Grant and Sabrina met, it’s not something they openly discuss. He added: “If you asked them, they would say they know, we donapost discuss it or the pros and cons of it on my behalf.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum earns 95 hour after","story":"NewsMum earns £-an-hour after starting her own naked cleaning serviceClaire OConnor worked as a hotel cleaner but decided to quit to set up her own, rather unusual business ideaShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsClaire quit her job to set up the unusual business \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Much like the fabled dress which went viral after many insisted it was blue, while others thought it was gold, the £ itemis the latest optical illusion to ide the internet. Aislinn James took to social media to appeal for help after buying what she thought was a lovely light grey rug set from the discount supermarket. But when her husband arrived home, he asked why she had bought purple bath mats - much to her frustration. In a post on the Facebook group Aldi Mums, she said: “Tonight my husband comes in and says why do I have purple bath mats in my bathroom.“Checked it out and the damn things are now purple! I swear I purchased a light grey bath mat set. “So can anyone claryI’m completely crazy orthese mats change colour in natural vs articial light  “P.S not happy at all with our definitely purple bath mats.” The post has received a mountain of responses, however it appears the internet is split on what hue the mat is. I see grey, no purple in sight, says one comment. But a fellow Aldi shopper agreed with Aislinn, saying: Bought the same ones and I swear they were grey and now look purple at home. Must be the lighting in store. “I saw them in-store and thought they looked purple so I didn’t buy them as I wanted grey, I was disappointed,” says another. A textile indutry worker suggests that it could in fact be both, because the mataposs colour apperance will change according to light. Certain colours especially grey or beige change in dferent lights. It will be back to grey in the daylight, they posted. The red becomes more dominant in articial light making it look purple . Another person added: It’s like the optical illusion of where the eyes and our brain ultimately perceive one colour and then we see a dferent colour moments later maybe  Hope you like purple too.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailBullied Australian schoolboy Quaden Bayles has come under attack from trolls and conspiracy theorists accusing the boy of actually being a grown man. His mum has hit back at the cruel online theories about her son after a video of him sobbing about being bullied went viral. Quaden, who lives with a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, went viral overnight after a heartbreaking video of him expressing suicidal thoughts broke hearts around the world. In the footage posted online by his mum, the young boy says he is sick of cruel jibes over his appearance and saying he wants to die.After the footage of him crying hysterically went viral, kind strangers raised thousands to send him and his mum to Disneyland. Quaden has since been showered with support from around the globe, as the public and celebrities rally around him. American comedian Brad Williamsapos crowd fundraiser has raised more than £, for Quaden since the viral video emerged on Thursday. The money raised will be used to send the boy and his mum for a holiday in Disneyland Calornia, and the rest will be given to anti-bullying charities.And Australian X-Men star Hugh Jackman was among celebs who publicly posted a message of encouragement for Quaden after his mumaposs viral Facebook post this week. The star also urged bullies to be kinder. The schoolboy has since taken centre stage at a rugby league match on the Gold Coast in Australia this weekend. Qaden, who is a Murri Aboriginal Queenslander, led the NRL Indigenous All Stars side out on to the field as they played New Zealandaposs Maori All Stars in clash. But even as Quadenaposs star rises, his mother Yarraka Bayles is being forced to fend off conspiracy theories about her sonaposs age. False rumours began to emerge almost as soon as his video began going viral that Quaden is actually an adult, not a child.  Social media users spread screenshots of Facebook posts, pictures and video mash-ups claiming to provide aposevidenceapos that he is actually a grown man.The posts accusing his mum of posing Quaden as a child and scamming the public are surging on Facebook and Twitter.But the theories have provoked a backlash, with many Twitter users leaping to the Baylesapos familyaposs defence and warning those spreading the rumours of the existence of aposdeepfakes.apos The increasingly sophisticated Internet distortion phenomenon can see doctored pictures and video spread online like wildfire.While it is unclear whether Quaden has been the target of deepfake techniques, many of the pictures are taken from his real Instagram page have been reused misleadingly to boost the conspiracy theories. In one post, images of the boy  have been spliced into a montage overlaid with hiphop music in an effort to suggest he is actually a grown man. Another post spreading online pictures Quaden at an th birthday party, claiming it is actually his celebration.  The rumours have spread thick and fact, despite numerous previous stories about Quaden, showing him as a younger child and clearly identying his age, being readily available just a few clicks away. Reports in Australia over the years centred on the youngster and his family as they raised awareness of dwarfism.  The reports clearly show he is a child, including pictures of him as a five-year-old from news stories four years ago which show Quaden with his front baby teeth missing. There is also footage available online of four-year-old Quaden at age four playing with toys on Australian TV show, which his mum appeared on to raise awareness about dwarfism. But by this weekend she was being forced to defend her son from online bullies yet again. Several accounts have even sprung up around Instagram and Twitter in the days since Quadenaposs video went viral.  Yarakka was pushed to react overnight after a Twitter account claiming to be the aposrealapos Quaden under a dferent name emerged. The account posted a series of gloating tweets claiming to be a rapper posing as the boy who had scammed the public for money.

We’ve picked up a few points but we’re not where we were.“I don’t feel like we’ve let that bother us, though. Now we’ve got the mentality to focus on the next game. Tonight we’ve got Inverness, who I feel will come out and play against us, so it will be an open and enjoyable game.“We’ve been training hard all week after last weekend and it’s just keeping that mindset of continuing on.“That’s been the big change at the club – how we react and how we deal with certain situations.“We’ve shown it before and we’ll do it again.“We’ve set high standards and when you don’t meet them you get disappointed.“It’s certainly not something that’s lingering around us. We speak about it because we’ve got a tight-knit group and we can be open with our opinions.“Once it’s said and done it’s straight back to the drawing board.“It’s a normal week whether we win, lose or draw. We drew and didn’t concede so we have to take the positives.“We go again against Inverness tonight. We’re  points clear and we want to keep it that way and open the gap as much as we can.“Hopefully we can.

We’ve done brilliantly this season and at the startyou told us we’d be  points clear at this point we’d be delighted.“It’s an incredible thing but we also know what football’s like and how, at this time of the season, everyone is still fighting for something.”Connolly reckons theof Paul McMullan and Louis Appere to the fold tonight is a huge boost for the Tangerines as they enter the final third of the season.Speaking about the squad’s injury problems, the -year-old added: “If you look at it it’s boys that, throughout the season, have been big players for us going forward.“They’ve provided a lot of goals and assists. Them coming out of the reckoning has been a bit dficult.“It’s good to have Louis, hopefully, back tonight, McMullan is right there nearly fully back and even Clarky is a little ahead of schedule.“As players that gives you a little bit of a buzz.“It’s tough but we’re a team and a big club so we need to deal with it.“We’ve got good players sitting on the bench that have come in and done a job.“I think it’s been dficult because we’re not blessed with too many out-and-out wingers.“We’ve had people playing out of position to change it up so once we get those boys back we’ll be in a better place.“Dillonand Rakishhave come in and did really well. It’s just getting them used to the standards, fitness levels and everything we do at the club.”Of his own situation, Connolly is just happy to be back playing after putting a troublesome hamstring injury behind him last year and since starting every game of .“It was a big thing for me because, mentally, it was tough being injured.“I’ve put a lot of work in to strengthen in my body.“My hamstrings just weren’t strong enough for the way we were playing and training.“It’s good to be back in and, hopefully, I can just stay fit.“I’ve done that, I’m feeling good and strong so it’s good to get a run in the team.“The main thing is us winning this league and, hopefully, we can push on in the next few weeks to get it done.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Gjen-busker-Alan-McWilliam_34812249-scaled.jpg ","title":"poster homage to talented local busker at his famous spot on the cowgate","story":"A homage to a popular Dundee busker has appeared at the site where he entertained thousands of commuters.Posters of Alan McWilliam, who died after a long illness, last month have been placed in and around the Cowgate underpass.The posters show the talented acoustic guitar performer situated at his designated spot, hailing him as a “wonderful man who brought joy and sunshine to everyone he met”.Dozens of floral tributes still remain at the site along with a number of posters, which have been welcomed by onlookers who knew the performer.The picture of Alan which now sits proudly in the city underpass was taken by friend Glenn Millar. vw, px\"  He said: “Alan moved to Dundee in his teens from Glasgow and he was called the Big Yin after Billy Connelly.“I think Alan would have loved the tribute to him at the underpass.“The poster went up on Tuesday I believe I haven’t been down to see it yet but I’m looking forward to seeing it.“Alan’s spirit will always be there it would be greatsomething could be installed there long-term.”One passer-by said it was a “nice touch” that the posters had been installed at the site, though it remains unclear who is behind them.He added: “My friend said there had been posters installed of Alan.

fund will see , children in , families in the city benefit.And he wants support from across the political spectrum for the fund, which he believes could lt thousands out of poverty.He said: “In the face of Tory austerity, the SNP’s plan to commit £. billion to social security is central to our commitment to tackling child poverty, and create a social security system with fairness, dignity and respect at its heart.“This £. billion will go directly to the families across Scotland who need it most.“With Tory cuts driving too many families into poverty the SNP is determined to use every power at our disposal to help families make ends meet.“This is a budget that will deliver for children and families here in Aberdeen and I hope MSPs across the north-east will get behind it.”The first payments are due to be made before Christmas this year.Scottish Government finance secretary Kate Forbes earlier described the fund as “game-changing”.A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “The Scottish Child Payment is a matter for the Scottish Government and we remain committed to working closely with them as they develop their plans, as we have done for the benefits

quarry could become home to monster tale","story":"The author of a best-selling series of books featuring a London Met detective – who is also a wizard – is planning to set one of his novels in Aberdeen.Rivers Of London creator Ben Aaronovitch reckons the Granite City is the perfect setting for a DC Peter Grant adventure, raising the possibility of a monster lurking at the bottom of Rubislaw Quarry.“You have this  metre deep hole in the ground that’s full of water just now.“You dug all the granite out then just put a fence around it and left it to fill up with water – anything could be living in there, seriously.“Cthulhu could be down there,” said Ben, whose books mix gritty contemporary crime procedural alongside magic, laced with comedy.Whether Lovecraft’s monster is lurking under the quarry waters is a moot point, but Ben revealed his plans ahead of appearing at Granite Noir today.He will be in conversation with north-east crime writer Stuart MacBride in an event at the Music Hall as part of the four-day crime-writing festival.The London-born writer, whose eighth “urban fantasy” Rivers Of London book, False Value, was published this week, credits Stuart with his fascination for Aberdeen.“I didn’t even know where Aberdeen was until I read Cold Granite, other than it was where the pointy bit of the nose is ,” he said.“Every so often they allow me to set a book outside London. It’s fun to take your character, who is set in their ways, and move them somewhere .“Because of the Stuart MacBride books I feel like I have a handle on Aberdeen in a weird way.“When I started researching I just found boggling thingsand I thought, ‘I’m going to have fun with this ancient city’, and Aberdeen is an ancient city, with this granite core.”Ben said Aberdeen won’t feature in the next Peter Grant novel, which he is working on alongside a couple of novellas.“I reckon I will be up in Aberdeen by about . I’ll have to come and spend some time up there first.”He and Stuart will be discussing “magic, mayhem, crime-fighting and comics” at the Music Hall at pm.“It’s called Wizardy, Magic  Serious Cybernetics, because the name of the company in False Value is the Serious Cybernetics Company… or Corporation. I can’t remember the quote now because I’m on the next book.”He said False Value sees Peter in an unfamiliar environment, working for a tech start-up and “finds nefarious things going on, otherwise there wouldn’t be a novel”.While crime writers are faced with the task of making the details of police procedure accurate, Ben, who has also written for Doctor Who, has the added task of creating a credible world where the mechanics of magic can work for his hero.“It has to be said, compared to the constantly evolving internal structure of the politan Police, magic is a doddle,” said Ben.“All you have to do is make it internally consistent, something I might add the Met Police aren’t. The slang changes from week to week and so does the internal structure of the police.“I have to keep contacting my police people asking ‘are we operating as borough command now or have we consolidated the borough command into areas again ’”“For me, with the police bureaucracy, the more you ground this in the reality of a proper police procedural, the easier it is to sell the magic. People will believe the magicthey believe the policing, because Peter does both.”As well as being hugely popular books – Rivers Of London alone sold more than a million copies – the series has now been optioned by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost’s TV company, Stolen Pictures.“But like all television it would be an enormously expensive show, because it takes place in central London and blows things up. So we will have to see whether someone will pick it up, because it’s going to take a lot of money.“But they are both really nice guys and they have a very good team. We will just have to see where it goes.“If it goes that will be fantastic – and I will be hugely rich, which is always nice.”To find out more about Granite Noir visit granite noir"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e5105216180e4.73419133-846x564.jpg ","title":"changes needed for aberdeen city centre to entice shoppers in","story":"Improving the city centre and ersying services will entice people back into the area, an Aberdeen shopping centre boss has said.Due to dficulties in the retail sector, previously held long-term plans have been put on the back burner.Expansion plans approved in  were to include a , sq m extension for shops, offices and restaurants, as well as a roof over part of George Street, a -bed hotel and  flats – however the sector has been said to have “changed signicantly” since.Centre manager Craig Stevenson said: “Bon Accord is always looking for ways to give shoppers new reasons to visit and to add value to our city centre surroundings.“The future plans for the centre are constantly evolving and we are confident we will continue to offer a space that will surprise and delight customers, whil adapting to suit the changing marketplace.“We have put forward plans for George Street because I think there is opportunities to develop that space for both retail and other uses.“However, since the plans were put forward, the retail market specically has changed signicantly and continues to change signicantly and as a city, our need for space has changed as well.“It’s not to say it won’t come to pass but not right now because of the market we’re in at the moment.”Mr Stevenson said that in order to boost retail in the city, there needs to be a change in view, as well as more creative offerings to entice people in, as the way people shop has changed, and they are now spending money on “experiences”.He added: “I think Aberdeen is now no dferent from any other city in the UK and it’s looking at how it’s using its space in the city centre and what was traditionally retail is now being considered for other uses.“Research shows that in the next decade we’re going to need a lot less space for retail, the retailers are likely to want to relocate to the space that is best for them and whether that’s the highest footfall or where their customers are, and that’s going to leave other space that’s going to need to be repurposed.“I think as a city we need to try to shape that change. I believe the customer experience and visitor experience is more important than it ever has been before, and we’ve got to try to understand what visitors to our city are looking for, and indeed what’s putting them off coming to the city.“Part of that, I believe, is to make Union Street more pedestrian friendly than it is at the moment which will improve the environment and ultimately attract new retailer occupiers there – that possibly won’t come in the current environment.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/5e5105a60f2937.57632342-506x564.jpg ","title":"job centre offer to help redundant aberdeen

the announcement.Staff from the Job Centre want to reach more of them, so have organised a drop-in session to help them find alternative employment and support with benefits advice.The Job Centre’s employer and partnership manager for Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, Karen Robb, said: “The events of last week must have been an awful shock to the Treetops staff and we want to do whatever we can

lost their jobs.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “PACE plays a vital role, supporting people through what can be one of the most stressful periods of their working lives.“By offering free advice and support through PACE, we want to help minimise the impact for people and businesses facing redundancy.“Our PACE partners understand the local labour market, and offer a wealth of experience in

soldiers in the Second World War to spearheading a campaign which changed the law, the six new additions to the mural on the city’s Flourmill Lane have changed lives in a multitude of ways.Originally created during the  Nuart Aberdeen festival, the project aimed to highlight people who have contributed to the le of the city.The mural, relocated to Flourmill Lane last year, has now been extended after funding from Aberdeen City Council’s Creative Funding programme.The new everyday heroes, chosen by a  of judges from nominations put forward by the public, are: Barbara Russell, a landlady in Aberdeen during the Second World War Justin Ritchie, a volunteer with Street Friends Helping the Homeless and Steve Rae, a Piper Alpha survivor and safety activist.Also chosen were Mark Taylor, for his fundraising efforts, Michael Brown, who campaigned for Clare’s Law after the murder of his daughter and dance teacher Jemma McRae who died after her battle with cancer.Lisa Campbell, great-granddaughter of Barbara Russell, said: “During Dunkirk, soldiers from all over the world who couldn’t get home were dropped anywhere in ports across the UK and the citizens of Aberdeen were asked to help them out.“My great-grandmother took in over  soldiers, mostly from America and Canada and looked after them.“It’s important we get the message out that Aberdeen is a place that welcomes anyone, especially in a bad situation.”Marlene and Alan McRae, parents of the late Jemma, said: “It’s unbelievable that Jemma is up there with the other  heroes. She would be so proud.“Even more importantly for us as a family is that Academy Street Dance Studio will continue to run and that’s a legacy it its own.“She always called the studio her extended family and that’s how it still is.”Offshore safety expert Mr Rae said: “When I was informed that I was chosen I was in disbelief.“As an Aberdonian born and bred it fills me with pride to be recognised as one of its everyday heroes.”Clan fundraiser Mr Taylor said: “I am shocked and also honoured to have been chosen for this award and I would like to thank my family and friends that nominated me.”Mr Brown said: “I’m delighted and humbled to be honoured by my city of birth and raising awareness of Clare’s Law is invaluable.”And Mr Ritchie added: “It feels amazing to be recognised in this way – thanks so much to everyone that nominated me.”Aberdeen Inspired community and environmental co-ordinator Angela Joss said: “While working on this project it became obvious to us that the everyday heroes had changed Aberdeen and the community around them.“We have six examples of amazing Aberdonians and it makes me really proud to be one.”Lord Provost of Aberdeen Barney Crockett praised the scheme and said each of those honoured was a “fabulous ambassador” for the city.And Mike Melvin, ACVO co-ordinator who was on the judging , said: “All nominations were outstanding and very inspiring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis.

His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

commitment to upgrade an informal path at new housing in Musselburgh as part of its planning consent discharged.One mother who attended a meeting of the planning committee said her family moved into the new housing after she was told the path would be created, offering a safe route to school for her children.However, lawyer Alasdair Sutherland, who represented Taylor Wimpey at the meeting, said it had come to light the developers did not own the land the path was on.He argued that without ownership of the land, the council could not enforce the condition and make the developers upgrade the path.The path, known locally as The Drt, runs from the new housing at Pinkie Mains down to the railway bridge and links Musselburgh to Wallyford Railway Station and Wallyford Primary School.Kaye Nicoll told the committee that she currently has to cross  roads to get her daughter to school after moving onto the new estate two years ago.She said: ldquoWe were delighted when Taylor Wimpey told us there was going to be a path almost from the back of our house.ldquoI think every child should walk to school and my daughter is now nine and desperate to walk on her own.ldquoI cannot allow her to cross all those roads on her own, some of them are quite dangerous for a nine-year-old.The committee was told that Taylor Wimpey was granted planning permission to build  houses and  flats at Pinkie Mains in March  and one of the conditions attached was that The Drt ldquoshall be constructed to an adoptable standard, including street lighting, along the extent of it between Pinkie Terrace and the East Coast Main Line under bridge.It also called for new connections to be added from two cul-de-sacs in the development.An application to have the condition discharged was made after East Lothian Council planning officers threatened to take enforcement action over the firmrsquos failure to construct the path.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoI am extremely disappointed a company like Taylor Wimpey have taken a decision not to honour a condition proposed by this planning committee.ldquoThey actually used this as a way to sell properties to people this is not an honourable thing to do.Councillor Colin McGinn said: ldquoSurely the developer would look at the conditions and make sure they could meet them before starting to build because in this case it seems they have just built and built and then looked at the conditions.Keith Dingwall, head of planning, told the committee that upgrading the path would cost pound,.Councillor Kenny McLeod pointed out the cost was equivalent to the price of one of the two or three bedroom houses built on the estate.And ward councillor Andrew Forrest said he had been at the original planning committee meeting which approved the housing plans.He said: ldquoI am disappointed by the attitude of Taylor Wimpey. They waxed lyrical about what this development would do for the area and my understanding was they were going to develop that path.The committee voted unanimously to reject the application to discharge the condition.Taylor Wimpey described the decision as disappointing, saying it would now consider its next move.Pauline Mills, land  planning director for Taylor Wimpey East Scotland, said: ldquoThis condition was added to the consent without any prior engagement with us, which isunusual.ldquoWe have always been aware of the planning condition to provide upgrades to the path known locally as The Drt and, from a very early stage following the issue of the planning consent for ourdevelopment in Musselburgh, we have attempted to engage with East Lothian Council about thevalidity of this condition.ldquoThe path is located on land that we do not own and therefore have no control over, and it is outwith the boundary of the development.ldquoWe have therefore been of the view since it was imposedthat it is not valid as part of the consent and have made the council aware of that view.ldquoWe have met to discuss this matter fully with the council in order to find an alternative solution andremain committed to do so."},{"url":null,"title":"senseless-vandals-hurl-bottles-nursery-window","story":"On the morning of Monday, January , staff at the East Loan campus of Preston Tower Primary School discovered that a beer bottle had been thrown through the window of the nursery classroom.The children, aged two to four, had to be kept in one half of the room while the glass was cleaned up and the area was made safe.

When the fire effect is switched on, it gives an impressive imitation of a real one.Our small terraced house once had a real fire place, of course, but like so many it was modernised before I moved in, and it was filled in and central heating installed.Yet I am old enough to have lived all my childhood in the lsquos and lsquos without experiencing central heating! It did exist, of course, just not in the houses I lived in as a child!One memory I have is of arriving home from school on a cold winterrsquos afternoon and seeing the smoke coming from the chimney of the church house we lived in at the east end of the Pans. My father had lit the fire early and I still remember its welcoming warmth, and the way it crackled and danced as it defrosted my face and hands. Me and my brothers sat by it, jostling for the best space.Donrsquot get me wrong, Irsquom not complaining about central heating! I know Irsquom lucky to have a warm house and never take it for granted. We donrsquot use the lsquofirersquo for heat, that would be too expensive. But we switch it on for atmosphere. And the effect on the younger kids has been immediate. They sit by it, lie on blankets by it reading and playing and telling stories. I forget that they have little personal experience of having a hearth, even an articial one. The novelty will wane, perhaps, but I hope the cosy pleasure of it wonrsquot.Itrsquos not just the kids, as my we and I love sitting by it in the evening. Wersquove even moved some of the furniture, so this pretend but convincing fireplace, rather than the telly, has become the main focal point of the living room.You could say Irsquom easily pleased, and I suppose thatrsquos true. But our friends have commented on it too, one saying ldquoit really has given your house a dferent atmosphere as he sat by it with the wind howling outside.The hearth has traditionally been the soul of a house. The family would sit by it, soak in the warmth and watch the flames, while telling stories and talking. It was a draw for social communion. Visitors would be welcomed with a place by it and most of the cooking would have taken place there too. The old saying ldquolang may yer lums reekindicated the importance of a lit hearth as a symbol of wellbeing and good fortune.No wonder so many traditions and ceremonies were centred around the hearth. People used to leave objects buried within or near it. There were ious reasons for this: to capture bad spirits that may come down the chimney, for good luck or to deflect a witchrsquos spell. The hearth was seen as a kind of spiritual portal, to be defended and made safe, not just physically.The hearth was also a focus of many ceremonies that marked the changing seasons. The Celtic calendar is full of such events, Imbolc being the most recent. And of course there were the daily rituals of banking up the fire at night, and reviving it in the morning, and keeping it going. All these simple tasks are now fast fading into folk memory.Today, screens are more likely to be the focal point of our homes. Itrsquos kind of unavoidable, of course, and I claim no moral high ground of this issue. But the truth is they drug our senses and dull our conviviality, and, like many parents, we have tried to limit their use in our house. It has felt like a losing battle with my children who, I understand, live in a very dferent childhood to mine. And I readily concede itrsquos got lots of benefits, even though at times I may sound like an old dinosaur lamenting the passing of the Jurassic age.But the arrival of our fake woodburning stove has transformed our house in a way that shows we have lost something in the lsquomodernisingrsquo of our homes. As a storyteller, I have come to understand the importance of a hearth as a focal point for gathering it has the power to bring people together, to share warmth and light but also each otherrsquos presence and social connection.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker. If Scotland had voted Yes, does anyone seriously think David Cameron would have staged that referendum on Brexit "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Why can t men dress properly nowadays ","story":"Football manager Pep Guardiola stared out: saturnine, grizzled, but above all terribly dressed. What was he thinking when he walked out the door  Did nobody call him back and suggest he change into something better  News of Manchester City being slapped with a two-year UEFA ban would have been at the forefront of his mind, I know, but thatrsquos no justication for his down-at-heel appearance. Did Emmanuel Macron arrive at work in a onesie when the gillets jaunes were torching Paris  Did Channel  presenter Jon Snow fling on any old tie or boring socks because it was Election Night But there was Guardiola in a baggy oatmeal fine-knit jumper that did his midrf no favours. That porridgy colour can be cruel, especially when, as in this case, it didnrsquot fit. The sleeves were long enough to double as skipping ropes. It was worn over a white teeshirt which, to be fair, was as white asstraight out of the wrapper, but his trousers were so faded and dreary no self-respecting charity shop would have put them in the window.Doubtless everything bore a designer label, but that means nothing. As I once discovered, it is entirely possible to enter an eye-wateringly pricey emporium and emerge from the changing rooms looking like a walking bin bag. Despite his position as one of the most prominent figures in sport, and with no financial constraints on his wardrobe, Guardiola chose that day ndash and many others ndash to look more like a sloppy teenager who has retrieved his stuff from the laundry basket for the third day running than a premier league manager and representative of the sporting elite.In this, I should quickly add, he is not alone. There are even stronger contenders for criticism, high among them the prime ministerrsquos consigliore, Dominic Cummings. Barely a day passes without an image of him scurrying past snappers in a symphony of greys and blacks, from beanie hat and tee-shirt, or creased, untucked shirt and low-slung jeans. Occasionally there is a flash of bright cashmere, accessorised with a plastic carrier bag.Long before Cummings advertised for weirdos and misfits to join him in Downing Street he had set a low dress-code bar, the sort intended ndash because it cannot be an accident ndash to convey disdain for conventional attire and standards. Such abject lack of stylishness might be acceptable in Silicon Valley or Deliveroo, but the message it sends is dismal. It also hints at menace, the attire of a dangerous lone wolf. Such slovenliness gives two fingers to the quaint idea that, when yoursquore at the heart of government, what you wear matters. If this is thinking outside the box, then Cummings has certainly nailed it.If yoursquore like me, you yearn for the days of Cary Grant. Gentlemenrsquos magazines in the s ran features on how to emulate his debonair outfits. But as everyone knows, while clothes maketh the man, some men maketh clothes look better than others. Grantrsquos Italian suits, fedora and glossy shoes gave him an almost regal presence. There was an artistry in the way he put things together, his raincoat draping around him in graceful folds ashe were a human waterfall, rather than bunched at the waist like a scarecrow. Dean Martin was another snappy dresser, as was Frank Sinatra, in his street-wise way, though for my taste he was a little too slick. When Columbo shrugged on his working unorm of ill-kempt Mac, he wanted suspects to think he was dim and harmless. They saw scruffy, and presumed stupid. To an extent, we all do.Sadly we donrsquot have too many sartorial icons here, although Sean Connery was never more striking than when the James Bond costume department got their hands on him. Thereafter, his preferred mode was that of a golfer who has accidentally strayed from the ninth hole. Ten or so years ago, one brave MSP friend publicly decried the national love of shell suits, only for the tabloid guns to be turned full-bore upon him. As a politician he stood out, among other things, for his fondness for plus fours and deerstalkers. I once gave him a lt, when I too was wearing tweed, and felt aswe had driven onto the set of Monarch of the Glen.It seems deeply unfair, though, that a man visibly and expensively supporting one of our noblest industries was taken to task for his loyalty. It was also unusual. Normally itrsquos women who are lambasted for committing minor or imaginary faux pas, people judging them, like books, entirely by their covers. In this, as in so many realms, men have got away lightly down the years. Perhaps that exemption should end.Itrsquos not that I care much what anyone wears. As a journalist, I learned to note down immediately what interviewees were wearing, otherwise later Irsquod completely forget. Nor have I ever been chic. Even I, however, can tell the dference between a well-dressed inidual and one who has gone out of his way to appear grungy and hip. Thatrsquos fine for the weekend, but not when yoursquore on the office clock. Mark Zuckerbergrsquos rail of unormly grey tee-shirts, to save him time choosing in the morning, set a terrible trend. Now Alpha males who aspire to rise beyond reach of the common ruck seem to equate a miserably relaxed style with a placard screaming lsquobillionairersquo or lsquopowerful beyond your wildest dreamsrsquo.The ever-suave George Clooney shows they are missing the point. A wedding guest who was told recently to remove his tie before he could attend the ceremony because ties are uncool, should have turned on his polished Oxford heel and left. Making a sartorial effort is a tangible way of expressing respect, not merely for yourself but for others. Emulating the kids, or pretending that casual clothes make no dference to your performance or the impression you make, is an older manrsquos delusion. A good suit and tie inspire confidence and trust, whatever your age. What baffles women is why, with such a simple formula for success ndash unlike the minefield of female fashion ndash there are still so many men dressing badly."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-large-glasgows-exotic-ottoman-coffee-house---graeme-souness-connection","story":"As soon as Imran clambered down from the roof he was forced to race to the basement where he checked the electrics, which have been acting up.When I arrive in the middle of all this frenetic activity hersquos looking a little stressed and exhausted, as yoursquod expect. But elation is in the mix, too. Is that because hersquos helped himself to a sly slug of the rich black perk-you-up brew bubbling volcanically in the corner of the coffee house  Possibly. However, the main reason hersquos in an upbeat mood is that a dream came true the day before. And today that dream continues.Imran is the co-owner of the Ottoman Coffee House, along with his brother Irfan. For several years theyrsquove used the location to host occasional parties and charitable events. But for the most part it has lain dormant, lurking just below the surface of the general publicrsquos awareness. A myth and a mystery to most, like a certain shy water-serpent from down Loch Ness way.For those who did manage to cross the threshold, it was almost like stumbling into the toy shop where that saggy old cloth cat Bagpuss occasionally woke to tell his tall tales. Or the quirky clothes store where Mr Benn got booted and suited and bolstered for adventure.Nerve-rackingRecently rumours started to circulate about the Ottoman Coffee House. Glasgowrsquos more knowledgeable boulediers whispered to each other in tones of conspiratorial awe and wonder: ldquoAn under-the-radar coffee shop, you say  With doors firmly slammed shut to the hoi polloi  Then let us snag an invitation at all costshellipIt was never the brothers Akhtarrsquos intention to keep the business hush-hush for so long. The reason it wasnrsquot open for regular customers is disappointingly prosaic, and dispels the fog of mystery that has for so long enveloped the curious bolthole, like a peasouper draped over Sherlock Holmesrsquos London.The unnished truth is that Imran and Irfan were far too busy to give the place the necessary love and attention it needed to thrive as a commercial proposition. They both have full time jobs that have nothing to do with catering, meaning there was precious little time to set up a fully operational coffee house.Yet the dream never died. And then, exactly one day before my visit, the dream became a reality, with just a little bit of nightmare tossed into the blend, to give the brew a slightly acrid tang. But no matter. Imran canrsquot contain his excitement, even with weather woes, electrical mishaps and supplies not turning up on time. ldquoItrsquos incredible that wersquove now actually opened for full-time business, he says. ldquoIncredible, but also a little bit nerve-racking.He sits me at a table and asks his brother to prepare coffee. And, no, that doesnrsquot mean a few heaped tablespoons of Maxwell House tossed in a mug. Nor is it the sort of homogenised gloop available in those MacCoffee shops that are scattered across every town in Scotland. Itrsquos not even that swanky Italian coffee, best drunk while wearing sunglasses, and before scooting off on a Vespa.Whatrsquos on offer here is unfiltered Yemeni-style coffee. ldquoItrsquos similar to an espresso, says Imran, ldquoBut an espresso is acidic and bitter. This is much lighter. Whereas an espresso hits your tongue and lower palate, this gives you a chocolaty full-bodied flavour in the mouth.Souness the MagnicentWhile Irsquom sipping my drinkImran and I talk coffee. We delve into the history of the drink, which my host has researched thoroughly, becoming quite the geek regarding the grinding of beans.ldquoThere are some stories that say coffee started in the farming communities of Ethiopia, he tells me. ldquoApparently the sheep were tasting these beans and acting pretty lively. A coffee house was opened for the first time in  in Istanbul. This was in the days of the Ottoman Empire. ldquoIt was two brothers who launched that place, too, says Imran with a proud twinkle in his eye.Because the empire was vast, the popularity of coffee spread far and wide. The pitch black brew drenched entire countries and cultures. However, Imran and his brother want to bring back some of the distinctive flavour of those original coffee establishments. The deacutecor in their establishment has a Turkish feel to it, which isnrsquot surprising as most of the furnishings were bought in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul where the Akhtar brothers were holidaying.There are also ious paintings on the walls of impressive looking personages. ldquoThose are pictures of Sultans, says Imran. Pointing to the portrait next to our table, he adds: ldquoThat one there is Suleiman the Magnicent.I peer at the canvas. Blimey. Suliman looks an awful lot like a certain former Rangers manager.ldquoIt could be Graeme Souness the Magnicent, I point out.Imran groans. ldquoYoursquore right, he says. ldquoNow every time I look at that painting, I wonrsquot be able to stop thinking that.Souness is perhaps best remembered in Glasgow for bravely grasping the thorny issue of segregation in the city, by signing Mo Johnston all those years ago and making the club more cosmopolitan.So perhaps it makes a strange kind of sense that a Souness-like fizzog is watching over the Ottoman Coffee House. Because this is a very cosmopolitan joint, with a genuinely eclectic clientele.ldquoWe want our place to be somewhere you can come in and chat and meet dferent cultures, says Imran. ldquoWersquove got Arabs over there, he says pointing at one table. ldquoAnd there are a few Turks at the back. Hopefully this place can be a regular sort of United Nations.Give a little backJust as important to Imran is the vibe the place offers. He doesnrsquot want people to feel theyrsquore being harried and hustled out the door. There are chess sets to play, sofas to sink into. Afternoons to ease through in a slumberous cat-in-a-sunbeam sort of fashion.ldquoPeople donrsquot want to get up in a rush, and I donrsquot want them feeling they have to get up in a rush, he says. ldquoWersquove already had people queuing to get in. But Irsquod rather they would come back after an hour, or maybe another day, so that the people inside can just relax.Food is provided on the premises courtesy of a pop-up kitchen run by Yemeni suppliers. ldquoItrsquos a lot like Asian food, though not as heavy, says Imran. ldquoAlso the spices are very subtle.The community kitchen was also set up to provide food packages for the homeless. Helping those who are struggling is very important to the brothers Akhtar.Imran explains that his father, a respected and successful Glasgow restaurateur, originally bought the space that is now the Ottoman Coffee House intending to turn it into a restaurant. But when he was refused an alcohol licence the plan floundered, resulting in him eventually losing his house.ldquoThings can be going well, and then, just like that, yoursquore struggling, says Imran. ldquoAnd it can come out of nowhere. So you never know why someone is homeless, or what theyrsquove been through. Thatrsquos why I think itrsquos so important to try and give a little back to those in most need.Imran says he learned a lot from his father, who died a few years ago. ldquoHe never complained and was always smiling and positive, even when times were really rough, he says. ldquoRemembering his attitude is incredibly inspiring for me and my brother. Especially when we are trying to push forward and achieve so much with this coffee house."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-brink-says-msp","story":"Moderate Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie will use a speech in Glasgow to say the party must change direction or risk extinction at next yearrsquos Holyrood election.As members start voting, she will say the choice on the ballot paper is between ldquochange or continuity and ldquomore of the same wonrsquot do.This is a dig at left-wing rival Matt Kerr, a Glasgow councillor who backed Jeremy Corbyn and is close to Scottish leader Richard Leonard.Ms Baillie, who was sacked by Mr Leonard in  for briefing against him, will play up her electoral success as the only Labour MSP to hold her seat at ever election since devolution.She said: ldquoThis is more than just a choice about who will join Richard Leonard as part of the leadership team it is about the future direction of Scottish Labour.ldquoThis isnrsquot a debate about what kind of future we have, but about whether we have a future at all.ldquoWe are fighting for our very survival at the next Scottish Parliament election, and we owe it to our party members and to the people of Scotland to get our act together.ldquoWe canrsquot hope to expose the SNPrsquos policy failings and arrogance in power unless we introduce the change within our party that will get us on the road to recovery.ldquoAs deputy leader my focus will be on campaigning and organising, working with our members and trade unions to build networks and coalitions of voters in every community, which is how I have won in Dumbarton.Mr Kerr has said the party must look to a ldquonew generation of activists, improve its organisation, its candidate selection and its local branches."},{"url":null,"title":"former-gove-aide-charge-scottish-tory-policy-review","story":"The Scottish Tory leader has promotedGordon Hector to behis new director of strategy.Previously the partysdirector of research, Mr Hectorwas also head of communications for Circle Healthcare, the first private firm to run an NHS hospital.He wasa speechwriter for Mr Gove in  and  when he was Education Secretary.At the time, Mr Gove was pushingthe free-market into schools south of the border with the help of his controversial adviser Dominic Cummings, who now works in Number .The SNP said Mr Hectorrsquos promotion showed the Scottish Tories would not be changing their spots on privatisation, despite Mr Carlaw promising a new look party in .After being elected leader last week by a three-to-one margin over rival Michelle Ballantyne, Mr Carlaw said he wanted an urgent review of all Tory policies by Easter.He hinted the party was likely to drop its previous support for university tuition fees and the two-child benefit cap which gives rise to the so-called lsquorape clausersquo.Mr Hector is to have a key role in the review alongside MSP Adam Tomkins, who was made shadow secretary for strategy in a shadow cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday.The first policy away day is due to take place on Monday.In , Circle landed a -year contract to take over struggling Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridge, which had  beds, , staff and a pound million budget.Three years later, the Care Quality Commission branded the hospital \"inadequate\" and it was put into special measures.Circle pulled out of the deal early admitting it could not find the savings needed to make the hospital financially sustainable.Mr Hector, who was educated at pound,-a-year George Heriots school in Edinburgh and has a first in modern history from Oxford,worked for Circle during the Hinchingbrooke failure.Hejoinedthe firm in mid- before moving to the Scottish Tories in .The House of Commons Public Audit Committee later reported oversight of the contract had been \"poor and inadequate\", leaving the taxpayer exposed, and said the projected savings in Circles bid to run Hinchingbrooke were \"overly optimistic and unachievable\".Before working for Mr Gove, Mr Hector was public affairs manager for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and worked for the London PR and lobbying firm Fishburn HedgesAn SNP spokesperson said: \"This may set alarm bells ringing.

That was six years ago.Painstaking stop-start rehearsals for the trio of dads at the cavernous Carlton Studios in Glasgow led to a debut EP which spawned Youre The Bomb three years later, that made my Best Scots Tunes of  list and served to indicate that they might just have something.If they began as a part-mash up of Radiohead and Bloc Party with a fragile heart, their long-awaited debut album shows a ersity that they have only hinted at before, perhaps a reaction to all the, privately disliked, Thom Yorke comparisons.They kick off with a bang. Crime of the Century was the bands first single off the album, and probably their most blatant attempt at pop, which actually turns into a four-minute surf-rocking aural voyage through a forgotten spaghetti western.If the band prefer not to be identied alongside any popular beat combo which has head and radio in their name, then the engaging Last People On Earth propels them away into twisted Wedding Present territory, at least the predominant rf does.:Video -New Scots band The Wild Places share the ten songs that most influenced themWhile you know what to expect, say, from a Lewis Capaldi album, Wires takes you on a far dferent journey, from deep melancholy, to hope and even anger, while the band musically blast off in dferent directions. Its a thrilling ride.The recruitment of recording guru Steven Wardhas helped to further expand the soundscape beyond the original guitar-drums-bass axis, and keep the trio with a semblance of direction.Nevertheless the delightfully dynamic Light The Way takes the loud-soft-loud axis and then cheats by ending just when you expect the crescendo. More is less, I guess.Fergus may not have employed his newswriting skills in his tantalisingly oft abstract lyrics employed in the pounding Little White Lies with its \"Ill take you down,its the last thing I do\" hook and enticing baggy beat. It may sound like it is about infidelity but it is actually about \"the overwhelming power of obsessive love and the line between constructive and destructive relationships\". Not a million miles off.The idea of moulding reggae and prog-rock might seem a fools errand, but the breezy Ghosts On Every Corner really works.There is a feeling that the band themselves are not sure when they are at their best.The debut EP highlight This Is How, wasthe last song , and their big anthem here arrives at track nine out of . The cinematic Fear City has everything that make this band so exciting, a flicker of desolation, a hint of regret and lost love, a smidgeon of optimism, cunning guitar work, dramatic percussion, thrusting bass and a soaring, spinetingling Thom Yorkevocal pay-off, that comes half way through rather than, as you would expect, at the end.The less immediate Hello Monster and In The Dying Light in the second half of the album, are suffocated against the other more compelling nine tracks here, but fit neatly into the sheer eclecticism on offer.:Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  The towering finale comes in the shape of Black Sky, a surprisingpiano-led ballad with its \"Im lted up, into the atmosphere\" hook which even finds room for a delicate drum n bass and an unexpected power-drum before drting off into the ether.It is no wonder the band picked Danish artist Trine Bork Christensen for the cover artwork.Like the album it is sometimes dark, partly colourful, always twisting, quite hypnotic and ultimately magical.And all this from a home-recorded LP. Theres no place like it.What do the band say Ewan said: ldquoWe love recording and are used to working in the time-pressured environment of a professional studio where time is money and everything can get pretty stressful.ldquoWith these songs we didnrsquot want that, we wanted to really take our time and make the record we knew we had in us. So thanks to our very patient families we took about  months and basically did everything at home. Even Timrsquos pretty full on massive drum sound was recorded in my living room with a full drum kit, which my very kind family and cat were good enough to put up with. It was hilarious. There were mics everywhere, the living room, the kitchen, cables all over the place.\"Chaos... but it worked.ldquoWersquore all dads with day jobs and kids and all that real le stuff, but itrsquos been important to us to really get this record right - a proper labour of love in granular detail. You never knowyoursquore going to get the chance to do this sort of thing again so you really need to grab it. When Steven told me he was up for working with us again, I thought -wersquove really got to go for this!ldquoI think the results speak for themselves, which is absolutely the core philosophy behind the band - itrsquos all about letting the music do all the talking.ldquoWe also had the privilege to work with a fantastic Danish artist Trine Bork Christensen who made lots of incredible unique artwork for our music. Irsquove been friends with Trine since I met her when she was studying at Glasgow School of Art.\"Over the years wersquove worked together to make art for some of our other music projects so it was amazing to work with her again.

After Brexit, the only well-founded complaints about immigration ndash that matters such as deportation and access to welfare services were outwith UK control ndash are settled. Nor, in political terms, is there any need to pander to the tiny minoritywhose objection to immigration looks suspiciously like xenophobia.Governments do not need to dictate quotas, points-based systems reliant on nebulously defined skills or unrealistic salaries it is businesses, communities and public services that are best placed to identy the need to attract workers from where. It is bizarre that a Government that calls itself Conservative should opt for a centralised, state-managed, position, rather than trusting such decisions to those most affected by them.With devolved government, flexibility should be the default position. The English regions have their own needs too, but separate tax codes for Scottish residents ought to make decision-making that works for local circumstances readily achievable.Claims that immigration has driven down wages are much less plausible than the view that it is the ludicrously complex tax credits system, amounting to a taxpayersrsquo subsidy of large corporations, which is the main culprit. Immigration per se is not damaging: the evidence suggests it is a boon.For Scotland, it is a necessity. The important powers ndash deporting criminals, the ability not to have to take any and every EU citizen, offering them the same benefits and state support as UK nationals ndash are already Westminsterrsquos. There is no need to insist upon micromanaging the needs of local communities or businesses, let alone to dictate the priorities of a devolved government in Scotland.A bridge too farThe Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement that it may be several years before the issues surrounding the Queensferry Crossing are resolved shows not just the deficiencies endemic in ministerial oversight of public works, but the torpor which impedes attempts to recty matters.This newspaper did not criticise the Government for bad weather, the formation of ice on the bridge, or for itsdecision to close the crossing on safety grounds. Our complaint is that a problem was identied almost a year before this crisis arose, and the reaction of those responsible was dilatory, complacent, and utterly beneath the standard that the public ndash which depends on the service, and has paid for its construction ndash has a right to expect.The impressive achievements of the project ndash as a piece of engineering, and as public infrastructure built on time and under budget ndash risk being undermined by this failure. The pressure on politicians to obtain value for money is justied, but the taxpayer has a right to expect that the whole value of a tender be given the same scrutiny as the bottom line of the bill. Public works which prove unfit for purpose, thanks to short-term cost-cutting, or a lack of attention to detail from those elected to oversee infrastructure projects ndash be they hospitals, ferries, schools or transport links ndash are no saving in the long term.Elected officials have failed to meet public expectations, the most basic of which is not just what the taxpayer ends up paying, but that the finished product comes up to scratch. That is a fair cause for criticism, and an imperative for closer oversight in any future works of this kind."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-first-ministers-education-pledge-truly-come-back-haunt","story":"Unfortunately, Ms Sturgeon is wriggling and squirming as she tries to find some new excuse for why her neck should not be on the line.

Ignoring the obvious is becoming an SNP trademark. As Scotland gradually sinks down all the league tables, it is also losing its desirability to the European Union of offering membership to a state so riven with problems. It might not actually be the Tories who save the Union after all, it might be the SNP itself.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon has asked that she be judged on her record on education, so the disclosure that the there is a marked decline in attainment in Highers in key subjects must be a source of worry and embarrassment for her, but perhaps not. The results, showing a decline in our gold standard in education is a serious worry for all of us who care deeply for the future prospects of our young people, when they will have to compete for university places against young people from other countries who are achieving much better grades. A cynic might say that this situation might benefit the SNP Government as our pupils will not have the qualications to apply for university, so solving the cap on university places for Scottish pupils.However, the downward trend in Highers is even more worrying as it will almost certainly be a deterrent to future foreign investors who will be looking for a highly educated workforce, and sadly Scotland is increasingly unable to supply such a pool of talent.Maureen Henry, Bearsden.I WAS interested to note that there is to be a review of Curriculum for Excellence by OECD on behalf of the Scottish Government.Because the nature and outcome of any such review is critical, it would be very useful to know the answers to a number of questions.. The nature and extent of the review, its subsequent report and timetable.. The composition and size of the OECD team. For example, will it be composed of academics selected from several countries or will it include experienced Heads of education from authorities or regions, headteachers, teachers who have been through similar experiences . The actual gathering of evidence. For example, will it include meetings  discussions with representatives of the principal teaching unions, the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, the Association of Headteachers and Deputies in Scotland, universities and further education, SQA  How many schools will be visited, classes seen and senior and unpromoted staff met to see the curriculum in action and its consequences . Does the above basis for gathering evidence seem over-ambitious, impractical or implausible  I suggest not, but such an exercise requires the use of suitably experienced and qualied people, time and effort to form the basis of an effective review. If the review does not extend beyond a potentially cursory visit, then, I suggest, it is a waste of time and money and will have little credibility and, sadly, fail to resolve perceived weaknesses in the current provision.At the very least, it would helpthe Government publicises its proposals as soon as possible.GPD Gordon, Bearsden.ONE gets the very strong impression from the BBC, and indeed from the media in general, that nothing goes right in Scotland and there is one \"problem\" after another to report on a daily basis, but not much to praise.It might be helpful thenThe Herald and even the BBC, were to look at the international sepsis problem of terrible infections, with a high death rate in world hospitals which is increasing in most countries.The NHS in Scotland strongly reversed that trend in the period -, which shows a remarkable per cent-plus reduction in one year. This appears to be as a result of more effective hospital cleaning services. The new level of sepsis infection in Scottish hospitals is half of the level in England and only one-third of the level in the United States. So perhaps you could look into this and give Scotland some credit for a change and do something useful by drawing attention to other health providers what is being achieved by the Scottish NHS.

OIC has also said all profit would stay in the islands and be used to aid in preserving and enhancing key services as well as providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.OIC claims the wind farm projects would also allow the council to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Planning applications for the Hoy and Faray projects are likely to follow in Summer and Autumn respectively, due to additional survey requirements for these sites. Public consultation events will be held shortly in these areas to present the latest plans and gather public views.All three developments are substantial, and the turbines are of a height not used in Orkney before, being .m tall at blade tip. The council says it recognises that the projects present a number of potential impacts and these must be weighed against the project#s potential benefits. Iniduals will have dferent opinions on that balance and through the planning process have the opportunity to express their support or objections to the development.Councillors agreed late last year that a request should be made to the Scottish Government to call-in the application on the grounds that the development is of national signicance. That request has now been made and the council is awaiting a decision as to whether they will call in the application or not.The full application documents are available through the council website, with more information available at the application search and submission page, here.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While provision has been made, it has consistently fallen short of what is required to reflect fair ferry funding.“Ministers may have changed, but the commitment was one made on behalf of the government. Indeed, the First Minister spent much of last summer in Shetland repeatedly the promises of fair funding.“Claiming it is the responsibility of everyone  to deliver the promises they have made lacks credibility. Instead of holding communities in Orkney and Shetland to ransom each year, the government should honour its commitment to fully deliver on fair ferry funding for these lelines services.”Ms Wishart added: “This Government has already accepted that it must provide full and fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles. Continuing to deny Shetland and Orkney the funding needed to run these leline services is completely unacceptable. At worst it is total cynicism.“The Government needs to step up and deliver on the clear evidence that it has been presented with year after year. We will not allow previous commitments to be traded away.“It is no exaggeration to say that the future of some island communities relies on sustainable ferry services. However, the money that has been given to Shetland Islands Council in recent years does not meet the true cost of running our ferries.“When the budget was announced it was described as having “wellbeing and fairness at its very heart”. But this settlement does not reflect that and is not reflective of a Government that is alive to the needs of island communities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The second advert, due to be screened in the spring, will showcase Orkney’s lestyle, along with work and study opportunities in the county.The adverts comprise footage created by Orkney-based digital content agency, Start Point Media, as part of the Digital Media Orkney Project, a three-year Orkney Marketing Programme initiative funded by LEADER, Highlands and Islands Enterpriseand Orkney Islands Council .Editing and advert composition was undertaken by STV as part of its Growth Fund initiative, aimed at encouraging Scottish businesses and organisations to advertise on the channel.Morag Robertson, economic development officer at OIC, said: “We decided to create these impactful television adverts with the backing of STV’s Growth Fund and the LEADER programme, as a complement to our marketing activities and as a way of driving more visitors to the official Orkney website, Orkney. It’s the main portal now for our visitor information, and the place anyone keen to learn more about living, working and studying in the islands should head, so we felt a TV campaign would be a great way to both highlight the site and everything Orkney has to offer.”“We’re really delighted with the quality of the two adverts,” added Maureen Shearer, development manager at HIE in Orkney. “The feedback on the first, focusing on Orkney as a visitor destination, has been fantastic and we’re already seeing an increase in the hits on the Orkney website.

It acknowledged that Orkney’s internal ferry services fell short of minimum standards in terms of cost, reliability, frequency and accessibility.

Stream the hustings here #https:t.co MtHIRXxWw pic ywIIgkjyvmdash The Labour PartyFebruary , The leadership race comes as the BBC faces a potentially drastic overhaul by the Tory Government while also coming under fire from some on the left of the political spectrum.The candidates were asked in Peterborough on Saturday how they would tackle the ldquoright-wing dominated press.Each agreed that every Labour leader had always faced smears, but said Mr Corbyn suffered worst, while Ms Nandy accepted they too will face the ldquosame onslaught from the media.ldquoI think therersquos partly a reason for this is because wersquore a thoroughly decent but cautious country and wersquore a party that doesnrsquot accept the status quo and always goes out to fight for radical change.ldquoThat means we have to meet a higher bar, Ms Nandy said.ldquoYoursquove also got to ask who actually owns the media and who runs it.ldquoI would like to see us mutualise the BBC so those decisions are taken by a wider group of people.She was expected to give more details on the proposal in due course, but a mutual organisation is one owned by and run for the benefits of its members who are actively involved in the business.In the past, MPs have suggested in the BBCrsquos case that this could also see its board elected by licence fee payers rather than by the Government and current board members.Ms Nandy also said: ldquoIrsquod like to see us not just move the headquarters of Channel  and the BBC out of London but commissioning power too so that what gets made and what is said is not determined by a small group of men behind a desk in Westminster or Whitehall.Ms Long-Bailey said she would set up a ldquorebuttal unit within Labour to ldquocounteract the negative press and ldquosmears.The shadow business secretary has previously suggested it would create ldquoviral content on social media to ldquospeak directly to voters.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir did not propose any new plans but said there must be ldquoersity of the press.He blamed Mr Corbyn being ldquovilied on some trying to ldquostop an incoming radical government actually changing things which elements in the press didnrsquot want changed.The ballot for the leadership and deputy leadership opens on Monday, with the successor due to be announced on April .The BBC is also facing a major challenge from Boris Johnsonrsquos Government.Nicky Morgan, who was culture secretary until the recent reshuffle, signalled the possible end of the TV licence fee, which underpins the current funding of the broadcaster.And a senior Downing Street source has also reportedly said the BBC could be forced to sell off most of its radio stations, reduce its television channels and scale back its news website.copy -.

Hate is a poison and this poison exists in our society and is already to blame for many crimes.” Responding to the murders of at least nine people in Hanau, Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were clear signs that the killer had been motivated by racism.Merkel, of the centre-right CDU party, has been described by some as the new ‘leader of the free world’ because of her strong stance against the sinister ideology espoused by those such as the far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Echoing Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he has declared “the age of liberal democracy is at an end” on the grounds that it is no longer able to “provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture”. Normally the US President is the unofficial leader of the free world, but Donald Trump, quite accurately, views Orban as “probably like me”.: Andrew Sabisky: what the former No.  adviser is alleged to have said about pregnancies, eugenics and race as he steps down: Boris Johnson is not a ‘real racist’ despite Brits criticism, says Home Secretary Priti PatelFor Orban, the Christian culture of Europe is under threat from “Muslim invaders” and there is, and always will be, a great iding line between these two religions. He is right about one thing, but wrong about everything .There is indeed a iding line that separates human beings, not just in Europe, but all over the world. On one side of this line are groups like Isis but also far-right killers such as one in Hanau another who massacred  people in Christchurch, New Zealand, last year and the man who killed  people in attacks in Oslo and the island of Utoya in Norway in .The fascists may view the ‘Islamofascists’ as their deadly enemies, but they are fundamentally the same. Disagree with them too much and they will kill you belong to the wrong group and they will kill you.On the other side are the vast majority of people – of all religions and none – who are decent, peace-loving and respectful of others’ basic right to exist.Racism and other forms of bigotry are ideological mechanisms, societal poisons, that can persuade people to cross this line into a le of violence, murder and death.So , on playing a word association game, you say “terrorist” on hearing “Muslim”, beware, because you are heading in a dangerous direction.The basic premise of liberalism – the prevailing philosophy of all true democracies – is that each and every one of us is an inidual. It is, therefore, the antidote to the poison of prejudice.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how to stay rational about coronavirus in the face of panic dr antonis kousoulis","story":"The Covid- coronavirus outbreak may feel scary to some, but it is important to retain a sense of perspective and seek out reputable sources of information, writes Dr Antonis Kousoulis.The UK is a bit on edge at the moment. Following hot on the heels of Brexit, we’ve seen weather challenges, and a news agenda dominated by the Covid- coronavirus outbreak. It’s fair to say public health and climate related emergencies are only likely to become more frequent in the next few years, as environmental and human challenges become more pressing.In the case of the coronavirus, we don’t know yet what will happen.The very best scientists in the world are studying the virus and its impact, and responding appropriately with containment, treatment and advice. We don’t know what that will mean for the UK and the wider world - how the disease will develop, whether it will spread and what the implications will be for our ability to stay healthy, to work, to visit people and to move around freely.Uncertainty breeds concern – and several mental health helplines are getting calls about the virus. We worry about change, and about things we can’t control. There is a lot of information and advice out there, some good, and some bad. It is changing all the time, and there is a lot of fake news around. Even health organisations have often taken a very top-down approach with patronising messaging about what people should or should not be doing, instead of properly engaging with the communities that are facing the real stresses.: Man from Heriot Watt University tests negative for coronavirus after advice sent out to students: A coronavirus hoax message is circulating on WhatsApp - here’s what to doyou receive itThe situation may feel scary but panic and stress can cloud our judgement and lead to bad decisions for our health. There are things that you can do to stay mentally healthy.We need to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak. Rumour and speculation fuel anxiety. Some diseases, such as bird-flu, did not develop at all. And not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Having access to good quality and up-to-date information about the virus can help us feel more in control. You can get up-to-date information and advice on the virus from the NHS, Gov.uk, Health Protection Scotland and Public Health Wales.Find a balanceWe should all be following hygiene advice such as washing hands often, particularly after using public transport or after being in public places, using tissuesyou sneeze or cough and disposing of them, and staying at homeyou are feeling unwell.Not everything you see or hear is going to be true. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it’s important to find a balance. It’s best that you don’t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intakeit is bothering you. You might want to mute or turn off news notications or your smartphone or limit your news intake to once a day.At times of stress, we usually work better in company and with support. It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we consume news about the outbreak, especiallywe have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It’s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health, and avoid increasing habits that are not helpful, like smoking and drinking.Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. You may also like to focus on the things you can doyou feel able to: use stress management and relaxation techniques, keep active and eat a balanced diet.Rumours at schoolOur response to infectious outbreaks, like in mental ill-health, has a history of discriminating against the most vulnerable. It’s really important not to judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. Being caring and supportive improves the chances of prevention and recovery.Talk to your children and your family and reassure anyone you know who is worried. Involving family and children in plans for mental health is essential. We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. They could have picked up rumours at school. Don’t avoid the “scary topic” but engage in a way that is understandable to them. We have more advice on talking with your children about world news.All around the world, there are epidemiologists and public health doctors whose job it is to look out for patterns in disease. But as the news cycle has become -hour, and our connection to distant world events more and more immediate, there is a very real risk that real, but small threats become hyper magnied in our minds before we have the chance to work out how concerned we should actually be.The critical thing for our mental health is that we gain appropriate perspective and context – without cutting ourselves off from important public health advice.It may be that the coronavirus outbreak burns out. It may join the other four human coronaviruses as a condition which appears and disappears from time to time – or it may become a global threat to public health. Whether it is this agent, or another, there will come a time when we need to be able to receive and respond to urgent public health advice. That includes making sure that we are in our best mental health to be able to act rationally when required.Dr Antonis Kousoulis is a director at the Mental Health Foundation, a medical doctor specialist in public health and a visiting lecturer at the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"stormy weather to continue in scotland into next week as new alert issued","story":"The north of the country is to be under a yellow \"snow and ice\" warning until am on Sunday - with separate warnings for wind, snow and rain issued for Monday.The yellow warning for snow affects for every region in the country and will come into effect on Monday between am and pm.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH1402NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 14th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

There is much more ‘going ons’ than merely learning lines and ‘tech’ work as the -strong cast fill the stage and raise the roof with their storming ‘Another Op’nin, Another Show’ number. The pace throughout is fast and crackles along towards the interval as Fred and Lilli lock horns but work to bring the show to le.Matthew Cavan, a familiar face to many as his cabaret drag act alter ego ‘Miss Cherry Ontop’ welcomes the audience to Act Two with a belter rendition of its ‘Too Darn Hot’ as the whole cast weave in and out of the stalls onto the stage. A special mention must go to Marty Maguire and Darren Franklin, two mobsters looking to ‘collect’ but take time to tell the audience to ‘brush up their Shakespeare’ in a classic comedic set piece. Cast and crew’s energy throughout the two hour running time is infectious as we hurtle towards the finale and the question of can or should the ‘Shrew’ be tamed  A timely question for our age.The Lyric and NI Opera’s co-production is a high octane, visually beautul way to kick start the Lyric’s  programme. The ‘Wunder’ bar has been set very high indeed.Kiss Me, Kate runs at the Lyric Theatre until February .

When the family approached us, they didn’t have a grave number but informed us the grave was in City Cemetery. When we checked our records, three people had been buried in the grave at City Cemetery.“It later transpired that the correct grave which belonged to the family of the deceased was actually in Glenalina Cemetery, which is adjoining. We appreciate the immense pressure on families when arranging the burial of a loved one and apologise for any upset that was caused by Council during this dficult process.”Responding to the council’s apology, a family member insisted that council officials had earlier admitted entering the wrong coordinates for the plot, incorrectly entering the letter ‘j’ instead of ‘i’.“We totally expected Belfast City Council to turn the blame back on us,” she said.“My brother told the council that the correct grave was in the top part of the City Cemetery, officially called Glenalina, but they obviously didn’t listen.“The council should just admit that whoever keyed in the plot number got it wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-16.02.40.png","title":"healthy food has never been this tasty","story":"YOU could be forgiven for wondering why a new café has opened so close to one of the busiest gyms in West Belfast. After all, who wants a feed after healthy work-out However, Kaff is a café with a dference. Located beneath GymCo in the grounds of the thriving Devenish Complex, Kaff offers a food and drink menu that is very much caterd for those gym-bunnies who hop by it daily.From a range of breakfast items to an all-day brunch, there is something for everyone on the menu – and for those who want a ‘cheat day’, fear not, Kaff offers a selection of freshly-made traybakes too, including caramel squares, raspberry ruffles and chocolate brownies.It was a Thursday lunchtime when myself and two colleagues paid a visit to Kaff, which opened a fortnight ago. We were shown to our table by a friendly and helpful member of staff.We were assured the coffee is very popular, so it would have been rude not to order my favourite, the simple, timeless, classic Cappuccino. An Americano and what I would call proper tea – the one in a pot with tealeaves – completed our drinks order.On to the food and the menu was a challenge – in a really, really good way. You can be as creative as you want using the ever-popular sourdough bread, eggs cooked the way you like them, not to mention salads, sandwiches, smashed avocado and beans.As it was lunchtime, we were drawn to the mouth-watering choices on the main food menu. I was immediately attracted to the ham hock, served with crushed potato, spring onion, spinach, a fried egg and siracha sauce. As someone who’s not exactly a gym regular, the dish was what I would describe as on the middle-range of healthiness.The pulled ham hock was melt-in-your-mouth stuff and full of flavour, perfectly-accompanied by some expertly-cooked potatoes, spinach, spring onion and perfectly fried egg, all bound together with that hot kick of siracha sauce. Every bite was mouth-watering and I would not hesitate in rushing back to Kaff to order again- it was that good. Priced at just £, it was great value for the generous portion.Across the table, a colleague was feeling creative and opted for toasted sourdough, complete with smashed avocado, smoked jalapeno salsa, poacher and black sesame. The dish had an abundance of flavour and he described it as “refreshing” given that nice kick thanks to the jalapeno. You can do a lot with sourdough bread, as you will see in many cafes across Belfast, but Kaff’s offering was unique and clearly a lot of thought was put into it.Our final lunch-goer couldn’t resist trying Kaff’s all-day breakfast – or to put it more factually, “a healthy fry”. It is was not a surprise to learn this is already proving to be a real hit with customers already – and it’s not hard to see why. It was made up of black pudding, beef sausage, grilled bacon, cherry tomatoes and some of the best poached eggs I have ever seen, all served with the aforementioned sourdough bread and smashed avocado.My colleague was particular impressed by the smashed avocado and plans a rapidjust so his better half can give it ago. I have to admit I was kind of jealous when it was brought to the table. For just £, you’d go a long way to find that quality at that value.With our stomachs satisfied, we resisted the temptation to go for an after-lunch traybake, but I was instructed via phone by a colleague back at the office towith a chocolate protein ball, which I was duly informed is essential for that tasty little bit of extra energy to get over the line in the weekly parkrun.Kaff is serving food and drink with a dference. If, like me, you have tended to pull a face whenever you’re hungry and healthy food is mentioned, then,l again like me, you’re in for a very pleasant surprise.Kaff Belfast,- Finaghy Road North,Belfast,Tel:   www.kaffbelfast"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/sketch-1581936686704.png","title":"meet the inspirational lori","story":"“THE greatest pleasure in le is doing what people say you cannot do.”That is how Lori Gatsi-Barnett begins her typical day. Lori has this amazing personality she is a very good listener and that is one of her attributes that makes her your favourite TV personality. She presents Join Her at Northern Vision’s NvTv.Lori is not a household name in Northern Ireland’s TV industry but I can bet you my last shilling she is daring and it will not be long before we see a sea of work from hershe decides to work in this media sector. Imagine not having your typical chest thumping, mean drama kings and queens we are used to on our television sets.I would say she is arguably one of the most influential voices in the Black and Minority Ethnic community in all Ireland. Her fair and balanced approach is something rare these days, always well researched, the audience feels assured that this is not just a regular motivational speaker but someone who loves her job and wishes one thing: that changing one is changing many. Of course, not everyone will agree with the person on the podium. The human mind doesn’t work like that. It would be very odd and annoyingeveryone agreed with you. But those who have perfected their art in using the power of speech to change society know only too well that the more critics you attract, the better.Lori loves sports, especially basketball, which she played at professional level and she enjoys swimming whenever she gets time for it. Her le is enriched with business skills, which has helped Lori to train clients in ersity work, small and medium enterprise and corporate social responsibility. She cannot afford to be idle becauseshe doesn’t do it, someone will, that’s the reality.Last year, Lori launched a community interest company called JoinHer Network. It is an open-for-all, impartial, internationally erse group of women whose main scope of work is to change women’s lives for the better. For all women, she says, “Things may be challenging but le is what one makes it. There are many surprises out there, you will not know until you take the chance. There are no limits to what we women can do.”Belfast needs many Loris. We do.The JoinHer Network has seven solid members from dferent jobs and erse experience in the arts, community action, health and business. The group is mobilising new members from across the community to get involved in pushing for making their stories and experiences something that would inspire young women not to give up in whatever successes they have ambitions for.Besides the JoinHer network and continuing to spice up Ireland with good food for thought, Lori is absolutely the essence and mother of good TV. Headhunters should be looking right here.Finally, another factual week. The first-time ethnicity was used as a tick box in the Northern Ireland Census was in . This event provoked hopeless debates in the prelude to the census in England, for example. The ‘crisis’ question was, why would the Scottish and Irish be granted an ethnicity status while the English were left out of this Well, the ethnicity question I am interested in here also brings the African to the table.•Elly Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renewed calls to open historic cemetery","story":"THERE have been renewed calls this week for Belfast City Council to re-open the historic Clton Street Cemetery to the public.The gates at the Henry Place site are locked to the public and can only be accessed by prior arrangement with Council officials.Local Sinn Féin councillor JJ Magee seconded a motion brought by colleague Geraldine McAteer calling out Council for their neglect of the historic graveyard which has led to undergrowth along its perimeter walls and accelerating deterioration of a number of headstones.Speaking to the North Belfast News, JJ Magee said: “We have tourist signs that guide walking tours and visitors from the city centre up to Clton Street Cemetery only for people to find out the gates are closed.“We are pushing Council to get the gates opened and make it a facility for tourists and local people.“I have been disappointed with the slow response from Council so we brought forward this motion to get a report back.“It is a massive asset for the people of Belfast with huge history. It is the jewel in the crown of Belfast.“The Council say it is closed due to health and safety issues. Nature has caused damage with trees growing and it has really been left abandoned by the Council.“Enough is enough. We need to start now and start fixing it up.”The call has been backed by historian Joe Baker from Belfast History Project.“Clton Street is one of three ancient cemeteries in Belfast,” he explained.“It is the most unique because it didn’t belong to a church. It belonged to the old Belfast Poor House at Clton House.“It opened in , two years before United Irishmen rebellion.“For me, the most remarkable thing is the ersity of graves. It is a small graveyard but there are , people buried in it.“That is so many le stories. It is a very historic place. The largest famine grave and largest cholera grave is in there as well as the graves of famous names such as United Irishman Dr William Drennan and the McCracken’s.“I am hoping it gets re-opened so people can learn more about its history.“It is also one of the very few green areas in the district so it would be a huge asset to the local community.“The Council say about costs and health and safety but that can be addressed very easily.”The motion has been referred to next month’s People and Communities Committee to allow time for a report to be brought back by Council officers.A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said: “We can’t make any comment until that report has been discussed at the March meeting of the People and Communities Committee, a decision made and subsequently agreed by council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"how to find out which foot you kick with ulster museum exhibition takes on northern ireland stereotypes","story":"Derry Girls blackboard star pieceExpandExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe Culture lab exhibition on display at the Ulster Museum.photo by Peter MorrisonThe CultureLab exhibition on display at the Ulster Museum.

The Belfast Agreement itself allows for people living in Northern Ireland to identy as British, Irish, or both. This Government#s clear preference is for Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. We have always made clear that, in accordance with the  Agreement, it is for the people of Northern Ireland to decide and we will always back their democratic wishes.It remains the Secretary of State#s view that a majority of the people of Northern Ireland continue to support Northern Ireland#s place in the United Kingdom and that this is unlikely to change for at least the foreseeable future. The circumstances set out in the Belfast Agreement that require the Secretary of State to hold a referendum on Irish unication are therefore not satisfied.The Irish government response failed to commit to the creation of a forum, and offered no further criteria for a border poll. The letter states: The Taoiseach has stated that the Government will continue to listen to and engage with the views of everyone on this island, both on rights issues and on the constitutional future that they wish to see for NI - whether nationalist, unionist or neither. These are extremely important issues which naturally require very careful and serious consideration and the Government will continue to engage and reflect on them.The motion, proposed by Stormont Communities minister and former councillor Deirdre Hargey, states: This city has an ever-growing population of young people who will ultimately have to live with the long term consequences of this British Government#s damaging policy of attempting to drag citizens out of the European Union against the wishes of the majority of citizens in Belfast who voted to remain.There is no Brexit that is a good Brexit for the citizens of Belfast or where in Ireland. This council must, therefore, investigate alternative solutions to Brexit that seek to protect its citizens from the damaging effects which Brexit will ultimately bring. In seeking alternative solutions to protect Belfast citizens, a referendum on Irish Unity, as enshrined within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, must be legitimately considered. This is a solution that would protect our citizens from Brexit and is supported by categorical statements from the European Council where, in the event of Irish Unity, the citizens in the north would be ed back into the European Union.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandPoll shows no evidence to back calls for border vote: AikenUlster Unionist leader Steve Aiken has said a major study showing less than a third of people here support a united Ireland shows there is no evidence to back calls for an imminent border poll.CommentOpinionMarisa McGlinchey:Dissident republicans see the PSNI as upholding the British presence in IrelandThe declining number of Catholic police officers in the PSNI has led to a recent recruitment drive by the organisation in a bid to encourage new recruits, particularly from a Catholic background. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadFarewell to a hero: Harry Gregg funeral told of legend#s courage and ability as Manchester United greats join mournersFriends tell of heartbreak after Co Antrim crash kills two young livesHow to find out which foot you kick with: Ulster Museum exhibition takes on Northern Ireland stereotypes Man in serious condition after Belfast crash Man in serious condition in hospital after Belfast daylight stabbing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Anyone aged  or over can join the Luncheon Club, with many members also availing of the free transport service provided for those living within two miles of Abbey House.The service also provides takeaway meals for older people who may be sick or have mobility problems.Kevin Doherty has been a member for the last  months and goes to Abbey House five times a week from his home in Donal Casey Court, a Choice Housing sheltered scheme located next to Templemore Sports Complex on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push Recommended“During a stay in hospital, healthcare staff were worried about how I would look after myself when I got home as I don’t cook and recommended the luncheon club. “The food is very good the casseroles and stews are my favourite and they do fish every Friday. “But the main benefit is the company, it gets you out of the house and I’ve made many friends here. I get picked up by the Apex bus and left home too you couldn’t ask for a better service.”Eileen White has been attending the Luncheon Club for the last six years, getting the Apex minibus every weekday from her home in Alexander House, an Apex sheltered scheme in Bishop Street. Company googletag.cmd.push Having raised a family of five children, Eileen cooked for seven people most of her le but after her husband died, she found she disliked having to cook for just herself.“I can’t fault the food and the staff are very goodyou don’t like something they’ll change it for you. “First and foremost, it’s about the company. I’ve got to know so many people and twice a week I leave from the Luncheon Club and go to older people’s clubs in the Gasyard and Brandywell. Takeaway meals“Anyone living on their own should join a Luncheon Club. It’s a long day sitting by yourself in the house the club has allowed me to meet so many people. I don’t know what I’d do without it.”“In addition to those who attend the club in Abbey House, the service also provides takeaway meals for local people who may be sick or have mobility issues.” John O’Kane says the service has been a ‘God send’ for his mother who broke her hip last year and as a result wasn’t able to cook for herself. “The doctor was concerned about her losing weight and her carers suggested we might be interested in getting meals from the Luncheon Club. “At the time, she was very frail, but now she gets her meals brought to her every day by her carers, has put on weight and looks a lot better for it. “The meals are very high quality and my mother enjoys them – especially the desserts. As I work full-time, I wasn’t able to cook for her every day so this service has been a God send.”Donna Matthewson, from Apex Housing Association, said: “It’s wonderful to hear so many positive experiences of the Luncheon Club in Abbey House. Not only does the service provide nutritious and high quality meals for local older people, it offers an opportunity for friends – new and old – to come together five days a week for a chat and a bit of craic. “Unfortunately, social isolation and loneliness can be a problem faced by many older people. We’re proud that our Luncheon Club goes some way to prevent that locally, and hope its membership will only grow in numbers.”A meal from Abbey House Luncheon Club ranges from pound to pound., depending on the number of courses and free transport is provided for those living within a two mile radius of the scheme.

When boarding a Dublin bus in Dundrum, my constituent was refused entry to the bus and told that his pass was invalid, which of course is not the case. Obviously, this was a source of frustration and embarrassment, and would in many cases discourage a potential traveller from using the SmartPass.The MLA added: I have written to the Minister for Infrastructure to request that the notice that these passes are eligible in all  counties is made explicit on the pass, and also that there is greater tie in with bus operators in the  counties to ensure that drivers are trained correctly and made aware of the eligibility of these passes.I will be raising this issue with our infrastructure spokespeople in the assembly and in the Dail to ensure that a meeting is requested with the bus operators in the  counties, who should be training their staff properly about which passes are valid for use.The dark days of cross-border travel being an issue are thankfully well behind us. Obviously, Brexit threatens this again, and it is in the interest of all elected reps to ensure that free movement across Ireland remains a norm. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its such a wonderful cause and Lucy really opened my eyes to it.I was nervous when it came to getting it cut, but she couldnt wait and she was all smiles.I took some photos of her getting it done and didnt realise until after that shes winking in one of them.Lucy raised pound through an online sponsorship and the rest was donated by family and friends.Its a great charity and its lovely that Lucy will be helping other children, continued Ms Cruickshank.Its nice to raise awareness that the charity is out there and maybe other girls will want to do the same thing.Id also like to thank Selena Doherty McFeely, of Syenna Hair and Beauty in Pump Street, where she got it cut and Dearbhla Lynch, the hairdresser who cut it for her. googletag.cmd.pushIf you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The children and young people have explored what it feels like to grow up in Derry City and Strabane, talking about things like places to play, meeting friends, being healthy and feeling safe.The information collected during the discovery phase will be used to shape the two-three year action plan to make the vision of a Child Friendly Community a reality.Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, attended the event and thanked the young people in attendance for their useful and honest contribution.“Child Friendly Communities aim to create cities and communities where all children have a meaningful say in and truly benefit from the local decisions, services and spaces that shape their lives,” she explained.“With expert training and guidance from Unicef UK, the partnership sees politicians, staff and volunteers turning to children’s rights – as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – to guide decisions that affect children and young people.“Ongoing work has been taking place at a local level and a range of youth and adult stakeholders have already been involved in remote consultation.”Concluding, the Mayor said:“This event allowed children and young people to have an input into the decisions that affect them – from major policies, to decisions around the care they receive.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

The Leitrim Road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all weekend.The Department of Infrastructure says that it has programmed the resurfacing work and traffic management arrangements to minimise inconvenience, but warns that drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Confirmation of the Leitrim Road scheme has been welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and SLieve Croob councillor Hugh Gallagher.Mr McGrath said the resurfacing scheme represents signicant investment in a rural area.He continued: ldquoThere has been concern for some time among many people in South Down that there is a regional disparity between how much investment rural areas have received compared to the more urban counterparts.ldquoI am absolutely delighted that infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon is working to alleviate that. When the Assembly was restored I spoke about how she would work to connect communities. In this instance that is literally what she is achieving. This is win for everyone.Mr McGrath said he looked forward to the completion of the Leitrim Road scheme and asked drivers to be patient as work progresses and use the ersions that will be in place.Cllr Gallagher said while Slieve Croob is a ldquomost beautul area,roads are not up to scratch, no one will enjoy the location.ldquoThis resurfacing scheme is about more than just making the road fit purpose. It can act as a driver for future investment in this area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Archaeologists.jpg","title":"Archaeologists find ‘treasures’ during dig  ","story":"SOME of the medieval lsquotreasuresrsquo unearthed during a dig at Down Cathedral last year will be revealed next month.Excavation director Brian Sloan from the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork, Queenrsquos University Belfast, will display several of the items recovered when he gives a talk at Down County Museum on Wednesday, March , from .pm.Last summer archaeologists from the centre, working alongside members of the community, discovered hundreds of medieval artefact in a dig at a site adjacent to Down Cathedral.More then  people took part in the dig mdash most of them young mdash while it also attracted some , visitors to come along to view the process.An earlier community dig in  had exposed a medieval kitchen building and associated rubbish pits at the siteLast yearrsquos dig went further and produced hundreds of medieval artefacts, including some surprises, reinforcing the importance of Downpatrick during the medieval period and before.Some of the artefacts included medieval pottery, animal bones, bronze pins, an Early Christian cross slab and a bronze section of a medieval cross with settings for precious stones.Wooden barrel staves were found at the bottom of one pit and Mr Sloan at the lecture will reveal how they have been dated.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey encouraged all those interested to attend the free event.He said: ldquoThe archaeological excavation revealed some very exciting and unusual objects and shows how important this site was in the medieval period.The attendance at the dig during the summer shows how widespread interest is in archaeology and this talk will provide people with a great opportunity to find out more.The dig was part of a series of projects funded by Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilrsquos PEACE IV programme.The digs were designed to find out more about le in the past, but also to help people understand local history and culture and gain skills in working in archaeology.Members of the Centre for Archaeological Fieldwork spent five weeks investigating the site working alongside volunteers.The archaeological project was supported by

this week.Newry, Mourne and Down councillors heard on Monday night that the long awaited Ballykinlar Community Centre has yet to be occupied even though it has been ready since Christmas.The issue is that NIE Networks is having problems getting agreement from the Ministry of Defence to carry out work on its land at the nearby disused army barracks in order to get a mains supply to the council-run

Ballykinlar.Councillors attending a meeting of the Active and Healthy Communities Committee were told that the connection agreement ldquocould be a long-term problem and the longer the facility is left unoccupied, the more prone it will become to vandalism.They also heard that Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association was ldquovery keen to open the facility with numerous users waiting to move in.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason urged council officers to step in and to seea temporary supply of electricity could provided by generators in the interim.She said: ldquoThe community groups are crying out to use these facilities and a lot of things depend on it such as the allotments and formation of a new Menrsquos Shed.Downpatrick councillor John Trainor also asked the council to see what could be done as he said it was clear that the facility was much needed.Council officer Janine Hillen offered a temporary solution of using pound, to pay for the use of electricity generators until it ran out, which was proposed by Cllr Mason and seconded by Cllr Trainor.If a generator is used to provide electricity to Ballykinlar Community Centre, it will be the second council facility to use this method as a generator is used at the Flying Horse civic amenity centre in Downpatrick.Yesterday Cllr Mason said it was ldquocompletely unacceptable that the Ballykinlar community have been let down on this.ldquoThis community group have worked tirelessly to get this much needed new facility in the village, she remarked. ldquoBoth council officials and County Down Rural Community Network have worked alongside the community to secure funding and resources for the site, but they now find themselves unable to use it due to lack of an electricity connection.ldquoIt is imperative that NIE and the Ministry of Defence overcome any barriers that is stopping this electricity connection.Cllr Mason said South Down MP Chris Hazzard had made representations to the Secretary of State to stress the importance of the community facility for Ballykinlar and to ldquosort this issue as soon as possible.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he would continue to call on the council to get the matter sorted out as soon as possible.ldquoIrsquom very annoyed to think that this much-needed facility is lying idle as the community has been waiting on this for years.ldquoPeople were delighted to have been told that they would get this facility on a site which had been used as a drinking den and itrsquos about time they were able to use it.After the meeting Niall Addis, chairman of the Ballykinlar and Tyrella Community Association, spoke of his growing frustration at not being able to use the centre.ldquoWe are all so ready to get into the building and use it, said Mr Addis, ldquoApart from our group, the Forever Young pensioners group wants to use it, the Allotments Society, a new Menrsquos Shed and I have at least five people who wish to hold parties at the centre but I canrsquot give them a date when it is opening.Mr Addis said he had to lobby to get the council to allow the contractorrsquos generator to be used to power the councilrsquos sustainable Christmas tree for a few days and he is angry that this was not continued beyond that.ldquoThis is not acceptable and needs to be sorted out, said Mr Addis. ldquoIrsquom calling on the council, NIE and the MoD to address the power supply on as soon as possible.Last night the Ministry of Defence indicated that it had been working with NIE Networks and ldquoawaited confirmation of the proposed works.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the

All reported that they were looking forward to the real event with even more anticipation having had the tester.Last One StandingAs usual, on this weekend every year, the Last One Standing take place in Castleward.Admittedly, the organisers donrsquot usually have to consider the elements to any great extent as it is an endurance test of the inidual against whatever arises, but the warnings about the arrival of Storm Dennis meant that extra caution had to be exercised this year.With most of the course on grass or muddy forest tracks and with much of it also under the usually benign shelter of the many trees, consideration of the likely effects of the much heralded Storm Dennis had to be a priority.However, cometh the hour cometh the manwho were undaunted by the prospect of storm force rain and wind in their attempts to attain the coveted title of Last One Standing .I personally have to take my hat off to every one who set out on the journey, which no one knows how long it will take or how far it will be, depending as it does on the persistence and bloody mindedness of those participating.The format is basically that every runner has to be on the start line at  noon on Saturday and they then have to complete the course of . miles within the hour and be on the start line again at pm and so on for every hour thereafter.Anyone who fails to finish within the hour or who fails to be on the start line when the next hour begins is automatically excluded from further participation.So, then it develops into a poker game of who will keep going the longest as hour after hour the field gradually reduces until only one person begins what will be the final lap, which he she has to complete to be declared the Last One Standing.In theory, anyone can win, though there are, like in every branch of sport, those who will attract greater support as favourites because of their previous experience at this type of physical activity. Among those would be the likes of previous winner Peter Cromie, from Omagh and Cork man Eoin Keith, who has won many long distance events both in Ireland and abroad, including setting records over  hours endurance races, where the emphasis is on how far one can travel in the allotted time, unlike this one, where itrsquos a case of how long can one keep going for, knowing that all one hour will yield will be . miles.But they have the stickability factor which is so important in this type of event. And so it came to pass that after completing  laps and . miles that the winner was Peter Cromie, following Eoinrsquos retirement at the end of lap . What a battle this proved.In the absence of any results it is not possible to comment further on how any locals fared, but hopefully Irsquoll have more information next week.Jimmyrsquos If you havenrsquot yet signed up to Jimmyrsquos ,  then you should put it on your to do list asap as it is only four weeks until race day.Entries online at https:athleticsni.org Fixtures Jimmys-Ten- or email info@eastdownac for further information.

This film is her fight to understand the events that shaped her le, in order to move on.The storyline has some parallels with her own le as before her family moved to New York, her father was sentenced to six years in the former Long Kesh prison after being arrested in  on suspicion of carrying a weapon.Apart from writing and filming The Shore at Killough, which was produced by Oorlagh, Terry early earned his film-making credentials as the screenwriter for the film, In the Name of the Father , based on the story of the Guildford Four and wrote the screenplay and directed Some Motherrsquos Son .He has since gone on to write other major films such as The Promise in .While Oolagh worked alongside her father in some of his productions, she has branched out on her own and is currently developing a television drama called Faultline, which she co-created with The Wire writer, Edward Burns.It took six years for Oorlagh Georgersquos screen play of Stranger with a Camera to make it into production. The project has been developed through Sundance Institutersquos Screenwriting and Directing Labs.Oorlagh is producing the film with Mary Ann Marino , Molly Egan , and John Wallace .The film is supported by Sundance Institute, Northern Ireland Screen and Screen Ireland, with additional grant support by The Utah Film Centre and Artemis Rising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Schoolchildren.jpg","title":"Schoolchildren name social housing scheme in Crossgar  ","story":"A NEW social housing scheme in the heart of Crossgar has been officially named.Work on a scheme by Clanmil Housing to build  homes on a former derelict site in Downpatrick Street is nearing completion and has been named Everogue Lane.Housing officials approached Glasswater Primary School and Cedar Integrated Primary School to ask pupils to take part in a competition to name the new development by coming up with an imaginative name that would reflect the sitersquos surroundings or some other interesting aspect of the local area.A total of  entries were received from P pupils at the two schools, the most imaginative of which were submitted to Newry, Mourne and Down Council to select the winning name.The developmentrsquos new name reflects the original name for the village, Everogues Bridge, before it became known as Crossgar, with the winning name a combination of ideas from former Glasswater pupil Grace Chapman and Gabriel Gormley, a former pupil at Cedar.Clanmilrsquos community cohesion officer, Philip Whyte, presented Grace and Gabriel with Amazon Fire tablets in recognition of their creativity.ldquoWe are delighted by the interest that the children have shown in our development and very impressed by the standard and range of names suggested, he said.ldquo Well done to everyone who got involved and thank you to the schools for helping with the competition.ldquoCongratulations to Gabriel and Grace who have together come up with the perfect name for the scheme.

It was then that the availability of an open space in the centre of Crossgar was highlighted with Clanmil.ldquoFollowing lobbying by myself and former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie it is good to see the end result, with Everogue Lane providing much-needed homes in the area and part of the shared future scheme all of which is an excellent idea.The Everogue Lane shared housing scheme is being delivered through the Programme for Government Shared Housing Programme lsquoHousing for Allrsquo with the Department for Communities providing pound.m towards the cost of developing the scheme and support the development of the shared schemersquos five-year good relations plan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Provinces.jpg","title":"Shane and Connor tie the knot  ","story":"NEWCASTLE man Shane Robinson and his new husband Connor Phillips made history last week when they became the first male gay couple to marry in Northern Ireland.Shaneand  year-old Connor married less than two years after meeting while working in Butlinrsquos in Minehead in May, .They celebrated their wedding ceremony and reception with over  relatives and friends at Hugh McCannrsquos in Newcastle last Wednesday.The grooms had best men mdash their respective fathers Patrick Robinson and Neil Phillips mdash and three bridesmaids each.They observed the tradition of not spending the night together or seeing each other before they met at the ceremony.Shane, who wore a pink suit, was walked down the aisle by his mother Marie while Connorrsquos father escorted him.Donna Murray, general manager of Hugh McCannrsquos, said there wasnrsquot a dry eye in the venue as the men exchanged their vows in a civil ceremony.ldquoIt really was a beautul ceremony and also very emotional for the grooms, family and friends. Our wedding planner team had to be very well organised to ensure that both grooms and their bridal parties were escorted unseen into separate rooms before the ceremony but it was all worth it. We wish the happy couple well for the future.While the couple are now honeymooning on the Costa Blanca, Shane spoke to the Recorder about what the day meant to them and their families.ldquoIt was absolutely brilliant and we canrsquot thank our family and friends for being so supportive, he said.ldquoIt means so much to Connor and I and our families that we are now married and that is legally recognised. Our families came together so well and have been really supportive from day one when we first came out. They have been behind us the entire way.Shane believes that he and Connor, whorsquos originally from South Devon, were meant for each other.ldquoFor me, it was definitely love at first sight. Once we got together, we became inseparable, said Shane, whorsquos a support worker for Autism Initiatives in Newcastle.ldquoI just loved Connorrsquos personality and how caring he was as a person and how he would do anything for anyone. Of course, hersquos also beautul.For Connor, who works in a Newcastle cafeacute, said he was drawn to Shanersquos ldquoopen, honest face and knew right away he was ldquoa good guy.When the two young men decided to commit to one another, they initially believed that it would be a civil partnership ceremony.Same-sex marriage was only made legal in Northern Ireland mdash in line with the rest of the UK mdash on January  as it was voted in by MPs in the House of Commons last autumn. Only the re-opening of the Stormont Executive could have prevented it becoming law and the Executive did notuntil after the necessary deadline date last October.Shane explained: ldquoWe registered for a civil partnership for our date last week but then when the law was passed on January , we gave our  days notice to the registry office that we were going to be married rather than the civil partnership. it was all go from then.ldquoWe did think of getting married in England as Connor is originally from there but my grandmother Kathleen Robinson is coming  this year and we couldnrsquot expect her to get on a plane to come to England.However, the couple did not expect their wedding to attract so much media attention as they were interviewed live on the Nolan Show on BBC One Northern Ireland after the ceremony.Another same-sex couple, Robyn Peoples and Sharni Edwards, married in Carrickfergus the day before Shane and Connor.BBC Breakfast initially asked themthey could cover their wedding by contacting Hugh McCannrsquos first.Shane explained: ldquoWe turned them down at the start as we were afraid of any backlash, but then the producer from the Nolan Show actually got in contact with our photographer so we were approached by them from every angle. We only agreed to appear on the show just two days before the wedding.Shane and Connor realise that while many people will celebrate their union, there is still a large group of people in Northern Ireland who remain opposed to same-sex marriage.But for them, it was just about being seen as a couple like everyone .ldquoWe just wanted to be married and didnrsquot carewe were the first, said Shane.ldquoObviously now we know we are the first male couple. Itrsquos a really big thing and part of Northern Irelandrsquos history so we feel privileged to be a part of it.The couple intend to make Co Down their home in the future and see themselves as parents.Shane said: ldquoWe would love to have children, whether thatrsquos by using a surrogate or by adopting, but itrsquos definitely one of the big things in our future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Storm.jpg","title":"Storm sewage deluge  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Ballynahinch have appealed for an end to what they have described as a ldquoflooding nightmare at the busy Lisburn Street junction with Main Street in the town.Persistent heavy rain swept in by Storm Dennis last Saturday left the busy Ballynahinch junction under water with traders forced to take precautions to protect their property.Storm water and raw sewage flow into a combined drain which struggles to cope when there is heavy rain, with speculation locally that a section of underground piping is blocked.Matt Comiskey, of Jordyrsquos Bar, said sewage was evident during last Saturdayrsquos deluge and revealed that while the issue has been raised with NI Water on a number of occasions, no affirmative action has been taken.He has been informed that work to address the issue will result in a section of Lisburn Street having to be dug up. He said it is important this happens as soon as possible.ldquoI am fed up ringing NI Water about this issue, the businessman declared.ldquoI have been given countless reference numbers by officials but no one is doing anything about this. The business community at this part of Ballynahinch should not have to put out sand bags every time there is heavy rain.Mr Comiskey described last Saturdayrsquos flooding incident as ldquoserious and revealed that he had to close a metal shutter at the entrance to the bar to prevent a mix of rain water and sewage from entering the premises.ldquoThis problem needs to be sorted as the issue impacts on a number of businesses. Six months ago the local council gave us sand bags and while a drainage firm has examined the drains on several occasions, its staff have told us that there is nothing that they can do, he said.Mr Comiskey said there is speculation locally that debris from work on Ballynahinchrsquos public realm scheme which was completed several years ago may be causing blockage.He also revealed that the volume of water being forced up through drains is powerful enough to lt heavy metal covers which could damage passing cars.Mr Comiskey added: ldquoWhen the drain overflows you can see raw sewage mixed with storm water. Every time there is heavy rain we have to be on our guard. We have been flooded in the past and do not want this to happen again.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is seeking an urgent meeting with NI Water engineers to discuss the flooding issue.He said there is increasing concern about the problem at the Main Street junction with Lisburn Street where there is a combined sewer which deals with rain water and raw sewage.ldquoBusiness owners should not be forced to take measures to protect their properties with sand bags when there is heavy rain. While the storm drains at this part of Ballynahinch have been cleared with powerful water jets, the problem continues to persist.ldquoWe cannot continue to allow raw sewage to spew out of storm drains next to businesses. The current situation is unacceptable and must be addressed.The Rowallane politician has also asked that work to resolve the combined sewer issue must be carried out in the evening to minimise the disruption that it will inevitably have on town centre traffic.Cllr Walker added: ldquoGiven the fact that raw sewage is involved, this issue must be dealt with immediately. Every time there is heavy rain, business owners are running for sand bags in order to protect their properties. They should not have to live like this.A spokeswoman for NI Water said that its wastewater team has confirmed that the combined sewer is operating ldquonormally and that the issue at Lisburn Street in Ballynahinch is a matter for the Department for Infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th February 2020 Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford residents in local boost  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Strangford can now keep up to date with all that is happening in the village, thanks to a boost from the Big Lottery Fund.It is financing a new village noticeboard, website and newsletter to keep everyone in Strangford abreast of all that is going on.Given the many clubs and societies in Strangford mdash which currently number  mdashthe villagersquos residentsrsquo group is delighted with the Big Lottery Fundrsquos cash windfall which ensures that it can deliver in its vow to improve communication.Group member Jenner OrsquoReilly has been writing feature articles in the newsletter about inidual residents and it has been a great hit.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him.

On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: ldquoIt has been a privilege to be headteacher of Dinas Powys Primary for so long.ldquoEvery day is dferent, bringing its own rewards and challenges.ldquoI have witnessed the great success of our pupils and now have the wonderful experience of over  children of our past pupils attending our school.ldquoThe whole team of staff ensures the best possible opportunities are provided for all our lovely children.ldquoIt is dficult to choose a single highlight. I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common.

The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
