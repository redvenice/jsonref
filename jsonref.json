Tuesday’s occurred on the first anniversary of the Lion Air flight 610 crash in Indonesia that killed 189 people. In March, after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed, killing 157 people, the 737 Max was grounded worldwide, and Muilenburg pledged such accidents would not happen again.But he was subjected to withering questioning from US politicians from both sides of the political aisle, in the first of several planned hearings and further investigations into Boeing’s conduct over the top-selling jet.Boeing was accused of putting profits over safety and developing a cosy relationship with regulators that permitted the company to rush the 737 Max, Boeing’s most profitable model, into service.“Both of these accidents were entirely avoidable,” the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, a Republican, said. “We cannot fathom the pain experienced by the families of those 346 souls who were lost.”Last week, an Indonesian report into the Lion Air crash criticized the design of the anti-stall system that left pilots fighting for control, as well as “deficiencies” in the flight crew’s communication and manual control of the aircraft.The Ethiopian Airlines crash led to the grounding of the aircraft. That decision is estimated to have cost Boeing as much as $9bn.At the hearing, the Connecticut Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal sharply accused Boeing of engaging in “a pattern of deliberate concealment”, noting that Boeing’s 1,600-page pilot’s manual mentions the so-called MCAS anti-stall system just once. Blumenthal accused Muilenberg and Boeing of supplying “flying coffins as a result of Boeing deciding to conceal MCAS from pilots”.At issue are recently disclosed internal instant messages that Boeing had not previously handed to committee investigators. The messages, sent by Boeing’s chief test pilot Mark Forkner in 2016, complained of “egregious” erratic behavior in flight simulator tests of the MCAS system, and referred to “Jedi mind tricks” to persuade regulators to approve the plane.Muilenburg claimed he was not fully briefed on the details of the messages until a “couple of weeks ago” despite the company knowing of the exchange before the Ethiopian airlines crash.The Texas Republican senator Ted Cruz called the test pilot’s exchange “shocking” and accused Boeing of withholding knowledge of the systems faults from regulators.Cruz said: “How come your team didn’t come to you with their hair on fire, saying, ‘We’ve got a real problem here’? What does that say about Boeing? Why did you not act before 346 people died?”Lawmakers accused Boeing of selling safety as an “add-on feature”, referring to a warning light that advises pilots of any discrepancy in the aircraft’s pitch, which was sold as an add-on rather than included as standard.“If you want to be the leader in aviation manufacturing you have to be the leader in safety,” offered the Washington senator Maria Cantwell, the committee’s top Democrat.The committee has said it plans to change the program that gave Boeing, rather than regulators, authority to sign off on aspects of the jet.“We don’t ‘sell’ safety, that’s not our business model,” Muilenburg claimed under questioning. “We have learned that we’ve made mistakes, and there are things we can improve. We take responsibility for that, we own that, we’ve made fixes going forward.”As the first Boeing official to testify on Capitol Hill about the crisis engulfing the company, Muilenburg said that since the 737 Max was grounded, the company has conducted extensive testing with updated software.Several other inquiries are also expected to report soon, including an international panel convened by the Federal Aviation Authority, the US regulator, to recommend changes to the way planes are certified. There is also a looming criminal investigation by the US justice department.Asked if Boeing could have done more after the first 737 Max crash, Muilenburg said: “I think about that decision over and over again. If we knew then what we know now we would have made a different decision.”The Democratic Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, a former military pilot, questioned why Boeing did not disclose more details about anti-stall system’s lack of safeguards.“You have told me half-truths over and over again,” Duckworth said. “You have not told us the whole truth and these families are suffering because of it.”Duckworth said the pilots did not know enough about the anti-stall system. “You set those pilots up for failure,” she said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44cb85d72b8f7cb5c32da52b1dd93d0c04554480/0_900_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797bb9332fc1667be47fcb56564a7085","title":"ms launches buy now pay later service","story":"Retailer hopes to woo younger customers in the run-up to ChristmasMarks \u0026amp Spencer will start offering a “buy now, pay later” service on its website next month as it tries to attract younger customers and boost trade going into the key Christmas period.The retailer has teamed up with Clearpay to offer customers the option of paying for orders of more than £30 in interest-free instalments. The Australian firm and its better known rival Klarna are among a wave of fintech companies being embraced by millennials on tight budgets. Many of M\u0026ampS’s rivals, including H\u0026ampM and Asos, already offer delayed payment services and the struggling business is eager to attract a younger generation of shopper, including families with young children.M\u0026ampS said its customers were increasingly looking for ways to spread the cost, particularly of larger purchases. The Clearpay service enables customers to spread the total over four instalments paid back across six weeks. The maximum spend is £800 and does not require a credit application and customers can manage their payments through a phone app.Unlike traditional high street credit products. these fintech firms typically make money by earning commission on the sales transaction itself rather than charging shoppers interest, although some also offer interest-bearing products. Shoppers using the plans typically spend more, more often, making it an attractive proposition for a retailer such as M\u0026ampS where clothing sales are in decline.More than 4,000 UK retailers, including Asos, JD Sports and Boohoo, work with Klarna which says it is more than 3m British customers. Clearpay, which only launched in the UK three months ago, says it had gained more than 200,000 active customers in the first 15 weeks of trading.Sue Anderson of the debt charity Stepchange said it was possible that these payment plans could encourage people to spend money they so not have. “The services are presented to consumers as a major convenience and an opportunity to ‘try before you buy’,” she said. “But the knock-on consequence can be that people take on credit when they otherwise wouldn’t have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5b74ccde1debd8c6d2d8f084df7b976a26a3839/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1bde11915e6b962382a13d6c9133b82","title":"the guardian view on a snap election a reckoning the voters may not want","story":"General elections must be about the issues. The 1997 election was about 18 “wasted” years of Tory government, with Tony Blair’s manifesto saying “Britain deserves better”. In 1974 Edward Heath called an election seeking an answer to the question of who governs Britain – the prime minister or the unions. The answer the electorate returned was the unions. More often than not, politicians overestimate their ability to frame the terms of political debate. Theresa May reasoned that Brexit would be the issue in her snap election of 2017. It dominated voters’ thoughts – but that did not help her. Boris Johnson might be on the verge of making a similar mistake.The prime minister has the election he long sought, though there was a surly undercurrent of resistance in parliament not giving in to Mr Johnson. It could be seen in the number of MPs who wanted to lower the voting age to 16 and give citizens of EU countries the vote, both of which are permitted in Scotland’s Holyrood elections. However, Mr Johnson persevered to foreshorten his mandate. He wants to weaponise the exhaustion that voters feel with the first stage of Brexit and shift blame to a “remainer” parliament for the delay. He hopes to stir apathy in his opponents’ base. The election is to be held in December, the first since 1923. There’s a reason why the month has been avoided for national polls. Cold, dark nights are not the ideal conditions to go canvassing, or to get people to a rally or to a polling station, however important the issues facing the nation might be.Reckonings like this are an insult to voters. The prime minister has tried to manipulate opinion to give the impression that this election is for the benefit of the people, rather than for the benefit of himself and his party. Mr Johnson wasted time after attaining office by not talking to the EU. He then unlawfully prorogued parliament to evade scrutiny. Mr Johnson came out with a set of proposals that were unacceptable to Brussels before being swiftly amended. There was no way MPs would permit Britain to be bundled out of the EU with no deal or on terms that threaten jobs, the economy, peace in Northern Ireland or the union with Scotland. The courts and MPs did not allow the prime minister to disregard proper procedure – to their credit, because a future government could use the precedent established for more sinister purposes. Mr Johnson does not care about such things. His calculations revolve around naked self-interest and power.Democracy should be about more than cynical calculation. Forcing the country to go through an exercise that there is little enthusiasm for is a way of feeding the distaste for politics that Brexiters often rail against. MPs voted for Brexit last week in the shape of the withdrawal agreement bill. Mr Johnson could have pushed ahead to get this deal through the Commons. But that would have been beyond the political skills of the Tory leader, who lacks the intellectual grace to accommodate the ersity of his opponents’ views. Instead the prime minister, whose political career has been marked by untruths and evasions, hopes to fight a dirty election aided by the propaganda he can mobilise on platforms like Facebook that allow lies in political advertising.Brexit will be central to the campaign. This ought to surprise no one. Dealing with the tension between the plebiscitary demand to leave the EU and the parliamentary urge to hammer out the least damaging Brexit compromise will remain the biggest task for the next government. Yet plenty of other issues are going to be foregrounded: the economy, inequality, and austerity. On the right, it seems that leading figures such as Mr Johnson and Nigel Farage scare and repel sections of the electorate. Opposing them are politicians whom many voters tell pollsters they don’t like or trust.

My 12-year-old daughter thrust a crumpled order form at me and I smoothed it on my knee to look over. It looked standard, with various packs and add-ons to choose from, all costing a fortune.Then, I saw some options I hadn’t seen before, next to the keyrings and USB sticks. Not one, but two different “retouching” packages, promising to “remove blemishes” and in the more expensive option to also “whiten teeth, remove scars and even out skin tone”.For $12 you could choose to airbrush your primary school child.My husband asked school staff why they were offering this when he dropped the girls off, and they shrugged and said it was common practice. He then bumped into the photographer himself and asked the same. “Kids get zits, you don’t want to be reminded of that.” And the teeth and skin tone? “Who doesn’t want to look their best?”When did “looking your best” become not looking like you do in real life? When did we start to tell kids altered versions of themselves are more attractive, better than the real version?My youngest daughter has mastocytosis, an autoimmune condition that presents itself as skin lesions. She has them all over her body and face. She has always had them and although they have faded a lot, she will always have them.Since she could understand what the lesions are, we’ve talked about the fact that they are as much a part of her as anything else. “My spots are part of the family,” she always says. Any “evening out” of her skin tone would be airbrushing away the person she is. As part of the same condition, she also has an issue with the enamel on her teeth. They’re a pretty shade of yellow. They are also what makes her her.When you order pictures, you get the class group photo thrown in. It’s not clear if you click “enhance” whether they pick your child out of the crowd to clean them up, or do a job lot. Will my girls be the only two without DayGlo smiles and perfectly contoured skin?Surely the joy of the school photograph is in the revisiting decades later. The dodgy haircut, the chipped tooth and wonky tie are part of the memory. Where’s the joy in homogeny?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f73e2dc8ae9a9e6c276fcd7578d0f1907771e662/0_263_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b27202c2c5c26afec491af34176036d6","title":"bus sized fatberg cleared from london sewer","story":"Blockage in Greenwich prompts Thames Water to reissue warning about waste disposalA 40-tonne fatberg the size of a double-decker bus has been cleared from a London sewer by Thames Water engineers who pulled out some of it by hand.The mass of fat, grease and other materials that weighed the same as three red buses, was discovered earlier this year clogging up a sewer in Greenwich, the water company said.Fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease are poured down sinks and drains and combine with items that should not be flushed down the toilet, such as unflushable wet wipes, nappies and cotton buds.Thames Water’s network protection team has been visiting food establishments in the area, to make sure they are not putting fat, grease and oil down their sinks and that fat traps are installed and working.Matt Rimmer, Thames Water’s head of waste networks, said: “This was a massive and disgusting blockage that took a great deal of effort and teamwork to clear and get the sewer working well again.“I’m happy that our team was able to get down and work hard to quickly to clear the fatberg before it could cause problems for our customers and the environment.“We’d urge everyone to help fight the fatberg by only flushing the 3Ps – pee, poo and paper – as well as disposing of fat and oils in the bin, not the sink.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23423099b4b20d066a7e80b0fdec7b72403c2423/0_0_5779_3853/master/5779.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2f56e6999744fde353f2411a6ebdf1a5 960w","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

Halloween is huge. What was once a cobwebby half-term afterthought has reinvented itself. Olde-world graveyards and broomsticks have been ditched in favour of Instagrammable nail art and carefully curated pumpkin stalls.There are lots of reasons why Halloween is a really bad idea. It is the demon enabler of the evil sugar industry. It is an environmental disaster zone of disposable plastic tat – the charity Hubbub recently estimated that throwaway costumes and accessories generate polluting oil-based plastic equivalent to 83m plastic bottles. And, if that wasn’t bad enough, every year it completely spoils an entire week of Strictly Come Dancing with green body paint and coloured contact lenses. Yet, in the end, none of this matters, because Halloween is supposed to be nasty. The worse it gets, the better. Deal with it, because it is not going away.Halloween is scary, funny and probably bad for you. It is hypersexualised and narcissistic and all about how good you look. It is restless, always on the prowl for the most up-to-date joke, the newest hot take, the most zeitgeisty meme. In contrast to Christmas and Easter, which are convened around wholesome, home-cooked family feasts, Halloween catering is all about the sweets andor alcohol, depending on your age bracket. It rewards the skills of being good at putting on makeup, overthinking pop culture and having an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes. And it looks great in photos. It is, in other words, the most 2019 party it is possible to imagine.While impressing your friends with your fabulous Christmas party dress is still cute, in a retro, early-00s-Richard-Curtis-movie kind of a way, it is your Halloween look that now wins the most points. Halloween is like the Met Gala, but everyone is invited. It requires wit as well as showmanship, gore as well as glamour. And it has to be rethought every year – sustainability red flag here, as discussed, but all the more reason to aim a bit higher than whatever crudely styled, statically charged tat you can get next-day-delivered on Amazon Prime. Read on for the looks that will make the cut this Halloween.The 31 October deadline will not come to pass, but the Halloween timing the PM repeated at every opportunity has fused the longest-running political horror show with the festival of terror and absurdity. Johnson – this year’s pop culture baddie – is the obvious look just rough up the Donald Trump wig from Halloween two years ago and add a bike helmet. But the Tim Burton vibes of Jacob Rees-Mogg also have potential. Maximum points to the person who figures out how to dress up as the Irish backstop. I have been working on a plan involving an Irish flag with a hard border, but I would be lying if I said I could explain it.“Avocado” was the word of the first half of this decade and “surreal” has been the word of the second half, a term that came into mainstream culture as politics became more and more absurd both here and in the US. Quirkily cartoonish takes on modern life are very Halloween 2019. Upcycle the papier mache art project that Year 3 made when they read James and the Giant Peach and combine with a model of the White House for a Dali-esque impeachment costume. Or team giant Chanel earrings, bronzer and false eyelashes with a Sherlock Holmes costume for a Coleen RooneyWagatha Christie look.No need for any of that goodwill-to-all-mankind, better-to-give-than-to-receive nonsense that you get at Christmas. Halloween is all about you. However, it is no longer socially acceptable to add “sexy” to a noun at random. A witch in a corset, a nurse in suspenders? Babes, the 20th century called – it needs its dressing-up box back. Instead, recruit a photogenic friend or family member and have them dress up as you. The Kardashian clan are, as ever, ahead of the curve here: three days before the date itself, one-year-old Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, was being proclaimed on social media as the “winner” of Halloween thanks to a bespoke outfit recreating her mum’s lilac feathered Versace Met Gala gown. Jessica Biel dressing as her husband Justin Timberlake (the ‘NSync era version) also podiums here. File under: because internet.It is like virtue-signalling, but without morals, and it is major. Obviously you have flawless taste, so this is your time to shine. Be the Hot Priest from Fleabag. (Also: so easy. Don’t forget the can of G\u0026ampT.) Or pay homage to Succession: is there anything scarier than Logan in a shawl-collar cable knit? Note: you can’t do Stranger Things – that was old last year.The late Karl Lagerfeld and his beloved kitten are the Gomez and Morticia of the 2019 Halloween circuit. For Karl, dust your hair with talcum powder, flip up the collar of your stiffest white shirt and pin in place with a fancy brooch. If you don’t have a brooch, one of those pearl hairclips that are everywhere and a couple of safety pins will do the trick. Add black shades, fingerless gloves, a fan and a can of Diet Coke. For Choupette, white cat ears and a mohair jumper should do it. If you are keen to show off your abs, there is always J-Lo in that green dress on the Versace catwalk. Or for insider fashion lolz, raid secondhand stores for a tweed suit and a boater hat and channel the gatecrasher who stormed the Chanel runway at Paris fashion week this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a75082955b937fa9366cc04adc7250306625a9b/0_37_5730_3438/master/5730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5be4272bc3ab47d807578534ac280b","title":"share your worst halloween pumpkin carvings","story":"We’d like to see your worst Halloween pumpkin carvings and find out what happened to them.

While Everton were on top by the time Holgate came up for a corner and stuck around to score the opening goal, they will have to play a lot better against Spurs at the weekend if they are to avoid a sixth league defeat in seven games. The Carabao Cup may not come to Silva’s rescue should that happen, for a side who take over an hour to score against Watford have no business dreaming of Wembley with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City still at large.Richarlison was booed throughout by the Watford supporters in the Bullens Road stand and seemed to be unnerved by the experience of facing his former club. His first few touches were indecisive, and when Lucas Digne presented him with space to run into down the left – right in front of the travelling fans – the Brazilian made a complete mess of a good chance to open the scoring.With both Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Moise Kean waiting in front of goal a pass was undoubtedly the right option, yet after storming into the area all he could manage was a tame, misdirected lay-off that went straight to an opponent.Half an hour into the game the stadium was eerily quiet and the atmosphere tense, despite Everton going to the trouble and expense of placing a blue plastic flag on every seat before kick-off. It that was an attempt to raise spirits and introduce a little cheerfulness, it failed to take into account the mordant Scouse wit. “What’s all this?” a supporter boomed as he took his place behind the directors’ seats. “Has Silva been sacked already?”The Watford fans were naturally speculating on the imminence of such an event during an entirely forgettable first half, one which saw the visitors gradually show more aggression and confidence as they realised how little Everton had to offer. Silva’s players had been full of running and ideas when last seen here against a ponderous West Ham. Now they had reverted to stodgy build-ups leading to predictable attempts to cross from the flanks, an unthreatening approach that Watford were able to deal with quite comfortably.Silva sent on Theo Walcott for Kean at half-time, presumably in the hope of some final product as well as pace, for though he saw little of the ball the young Italian had not convinced with what opportunities did come his way. Walcott immediately showed what had been missing, making a run behind the Watford defence that was cleverly picked up by his former Arsenal teammate Alex Iwobi, only for the latter’s passing accuracy to let him down with a ball too close to the goalkeeper.Watford’s best chance came after an hour, a thunderous drive from Andre Gray that Jordan Pickford did well to parry. It was perhaps not the most difficult of saves, though Pickford was doing well to still be awake after enduring 60 soporific minutes as a virtual spectator, and Gray’s shot came with little advance warning. At least the game came to life in the last half hour, and with Adrian Mariappa stopping a shot from André Gomes on the line and Iwobi hitting the angle of post and bar, Everton were the side looking most likely to score. Digne hit the bar with a free kick as Everton stepped up their search for a winner, and after Walcott won a corner on the right he popped up on the left to collect a cross from Iwobi that would otherwise have run harmlessly out of the penalty area, returning it with more pace for Holgate to head home from the six-yard line.Everton were defending somewhat doggedly when Richarlison scored the stoppage-time second that earned them a rather flattering scoreline. Home hearts were in mouths when Gerard Deulofeu lined up a last attempt against his old club that might have taken the game to penalties, only for Cenk Tosun to sweep the ball upfield after the shot had been blocked to allow Richarlison to finish stylishly at the other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b04a3961224878997efb11b00bd6b5de3dd7a21d/0_101_4831_2898/master/4831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d91dd778b130aae42af505ee2ef700ce","title":"manchester city southampton carabao cup fourth round match report","story":"Manchester City took their unbeaten Carabao Cup run to 1,098 days in a near-stroll of a victory over a still-smarting Southampton. This was the visitors’ first game since Leicester trounced them 9-0 and it showed. Southampton did, at least, lose by only two goals and achieve against Pep Guardiola’s men what they failed to do against the Foxes – score – but until City slackened off towards the end they were too tentative.Guardiola, who made nine changes, gave 18-year-old Tommy Doyle his senior debut and selected both Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus – in his 4-3-3 – for the first time since September’s 2-1 win over Newcastle United here. Ralph Hasenhüttl retained five of the XI that were humiliated by Leicester - Oriol Romeu, James Ward-Prowse, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, Jan Bednarek and Yan Valery.Immediately after kick-off the City fans taunted their opposition number with a rendition of: “We want 10”. The first shot they witnessed was Riyad Mahrez aiming low at Alex McCarthy’s goal but the keeper was able to gather the ball with ease. There was far less composure when McCarthy flapped at an Angeliño cross and saw the ball ping around in front him the visiting keeper was lucky this did not lead to the City opener.Doyle was operating in the centre of the middle three, asked by his manager to play the holding role. The No 69 spoiled a tidy start by spraying a corner from the left straight out during an opening passage in which Saints were pinned back.The challenge before the holders was one of trying to break down opponents who held position around the edge of their area. After 20 minutes they succeeded. This time Doyle took a short corner to Bernardo Silva, he swung the ball in and Nicolás Otamendi moved between Romeu and Bednarek to head past McCarthy from close in. It drew a self-mocking chorus of “one-nil to the empty seats” from the home support, as they referenced swathes of unoccupied areas inside the stadium.For Saints there was some succour to be found in their having been 3-0 down at the same point against Leicester. Yet, when Shane Long found himself with the ball deep in City’s territory just before the 30-minute mark it was the furthest his team ventured throughout the opening half.Guardiola was not totally content, though. More than once he urged his side to move the ball forward at pace rather than sluggishly and sideways. When Sofiane Boufal shoved Doyle over City had a free-kick 20 yards out. Agüero stepped up but his radar was awry and the ball sailed wide.Moments later there was no mistake from the Argentinian, City’s second arriving because they upped the tempo. Jesus fed Silva who fed Mahrez and, when Walker overlapped along the right, his instant cross was volleyed home expertly for Agüero’s 11th strike in 12 appearances this season.The expectation was for more of the same and so it proved with the team in blue again controlling the contest with ease. When high gear was engaged the visitors could do nothing about it, as illustrated when Agüero burst through the middle, flipped the ball to Mahrez, and his reverse pass had Silva in. He was thwarted by a desperate, ing McCarthy.City’s only concern was the possibility of a loss of concentration that might allow a Southampton breakaway. Mahrez’s clumsy touch offered an example but the ball was claimed back instantly and, seconds later, City has scored once more. Silva’s slick footwork left three defenders trailing before he found Mahrez. The Algerian saw his shot ricochet off Romeu and there was Agüero, again, to poke home from a few yards out.That was, surely, City through to the quarter-finals, and Southampton were left to try and ensure three would not become four, or more. Mahrez came close when a close-range effort was blocked but the sense was a next City strike was on the way.Hasenhüttl took off Boufal and Long for Ché Adams and Nathan Redmond on 70 minutes and his team soon claimed a corner. Ward-Prowse took it from the right and Jack Stephens forced a save from Claudio Bravo. It was the defender who scored Southampton’s consolation, heading past Bravo from another corner after Angeliño lost him. But this was a canter for the holders and Southampton will hardly be looking forward to returning on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1948fcb2cfd8fd9766668017e5900caeca11658d/651_69_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36f18d1bfcc826b83afd92003a761395","title":"toni duggan interview atletico madrid manchester city","story":"“It hurt,” Toni Duggan says, “it hurt a lot.” It remains raw, and serves as inspiration. All that time, all that effort, the expectation, and it was over before it had really begun. The England striker had reached her first Champions League final and so had Barcelona, her club, yet after five minutes in Budapest they were a goal down to Lyon, the competition’s winners three years running. After 15, it was two. After 30, it was four. “I wanted the ground to suck me in you just want the game to end,” Duggan says. Instead, there was an hour to endure, empty but for regret. There isn’t an adequate word for it. “It was so...”, “it was just like …”“You don’t want that for women’s football, you don’t want that for yourself, to be part of that,” Duggan says. “I’m a positive person. I was saying: ‘we’re going to win it, we’re going to win it’. I believed in the team, but when that happens against Lyon you’ve got a mountain to climb. On the pitch, I still had belief but it’s more anger and frustration and embarrassment. I watched Istanbul and that was a mountain too but Liverpool have history, they’ve been in finals, won trophies. With Barcelona, it was new and Lyon have won and won and won and won and it was so easy. It was really difficult to take.“The family had travelled over and you feel so much like you’ve let people down. Naturally, people aren’t going to say that, but … it was an amazing achievement to get there and one day I’ll look back, but that day I was devastated.”Not everyone shared her tears. “A lot of the Barcelona girls are young, 22, 23, and they’re getting selfies with their medal and stuff. I’m not criticising: it’s amazing to reach a Champions League final at 22, make history for your hometown club, but I was in a different mind-set,” she explains. “I’d been to semi-finals with City. I was always that close. I’d been defeated by Lyon so much. And I felt this was the day. I just felt it. And it wasn’t. I don’t know, maybe my expectations were higher. I was so upset. They were trying to console me: ‘don’t worry, we’ve done well’, but I was in a different place.”Soon, she really was: a different city, a different club, but the same aim. On Wednesday, Atlético Madrid, the club Duggan joined this summer, domestic double winners last season, face City in the round-of-16 second leg having drawn 1-1 in England. “The girls want to create history, reach the next round for the first time. I can’t wait,” she says. “A big part of signing for Atlético was the Champions League. There were other clubs interested, good offers, but they weren’t in it.”But why not stay at Barcelona? “It’s about being happy. I was happy but the football was a little bit frustrating. They have an identity, a philosophy, which I enjoy but I felt it didn’t get the best out of me as a No 9. I looked at Atlético, where I would fit, spoke to the manager and president. I played them last year and knew their style, the supporters. And I turn up and it feels like a family already. I haven’t yet scored as many as I did there to start with, but I’m more involved in the game, more comfortable, more happy with my performances.”Atlético also hosted last year’s men’s Champions League final, and Duggan’s family are huge Liverpool fans. “Talks hadn’t started yet,” she laughs. “It would’ve been a big pulling factor, that: two tickets to the final. I always try to get my brothers tickets, Liverpool got there and they were like: ‘Toni’ll sort it’. I literally tried everything without being too cheeky, but this time I couldn’t.”Now the focus is another final of her own. Another shot at Lyon, the club that sometimes feels invincible? “Yeah, they do,” Duggan says. “The financial support has helped them bring in top players, unbelievable. Other clubs don’t have that luxury. Consistently winning breeds success, too. Teams fear them. I used to feel that a bit at City: I wouldn’t say it was easy but come 70 minutes their mind-set would be ‘we’re against City, we’ll never win’. As soon as someone breaks Lyon down – we came close in preseason – and people see they’re not invincible, it might change.“I speak to the four English girls there and they tell me: all they care about is the Champions League. At Barcelona, our aim wasn’t to win the Champions League. There was a sense everyone was happy to be there, a fantastic achievement, but I don’t care who you’re playing, it’s a one-off: you can win that football match. I was like ‘this is the day’. It didn’t happen, but it’s inspired me to try again.”It hasn’t been the easiest start. The Atlético manager, José Luis Sánchez Vera, left for personal reasons 10 days before the first City game, they were hammered by her former club, and they’ve suffered injuries. But Duggan insists: “the spirit to deal with all this, I can’t tell you say how strong it is – that’s got to be a reason they won the league the last two seasons. We’re playing well now, winning, I’m really enjoying it.”“Here too. I feel like a travel agent, always sorting flights, but I couldn’t do this without them. The fans gave me a good reception there too, as always: they’re amazing. It’s nice they appreciate you, there’s respect, but if a couple stick the finger up or said I was crap I wouldn’t blink. It’s football. It’s City but it’s tough whoever you face. We lost in Kazakhstan last year. That’s the Champions League, it’s amazing. That’s why I came. I absolutely love the competition. I want to be a part of it and I want to be part of it to the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/459cbac7e84cef9b398813ef5d924c4a9707ea5a/184_314_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51d14e0ee65a66987ad8e923ecae1c30","title":"english football high horse racism eufa sanction bulgaria fa","story":"While news of Uefa’s sanctions on Bulgaria was breaking, Haringey were facing Yeovil in take-two of an FA Cup tie in which racism caused a player walk-offThe English reaction to Uefa sanctions for racist incidents is now so predictable as to be almost comforting: general, immediate scorn, and another airing for Nicklas Bendtner’s boxer shorts. The deluge began this time within seconds of Uefa announcing its disciplinary committee’s verdict on the shocking abuse from a section of Bulgaria’s supporters, targeted at England’s black players during the European Championship qualifying match on 14 October.The sanction – a full stadium closure for Bulgaria’s next international match, a second full closure suspended for two probationary years, and a €75,000 (£64,800) fine – is just tokenism, went the prevailing wisdom, and shows Uefa does not really care about racism. English football’s anti-racism campaign, Kick It Out, said it was “disheartened but not surprised”, called on Uefa to explain its decision-making – which it certainly should, much more clearly – then went further and called for the whole sanctions system to be overhauled.The €100,000 fine levied on Bendtner at the 2012 European Championship for “ambush marketing” – flashing boxer shorts branded with the publicity-gobbling bookmaker Paddy Power after he scored for Denmark against Portugal – made its mandatory appearance, presented as the barometer of Uefa’s skewed values. The fact that the €100,000 was confiscation of the money Paddy Power paid Bendtner struggles for a mention, as does the reality that a full stadium closure is a significant financial penalty, particularly for a country like Bulgaria.Of course the sanction is fair game for criticism and argument, particularly in these disturbing times of revived and rising racism. It is very difficult in any field of activity for punishments to really fit crimes, and for many this is inadequate.Piara Powar, the executive director of the Europe-wide Fare network of football anti-racism campaigns, formerly Kick It Out’s long-term chief executive, worked with Uefa on developing this sanctions framework in 2013, but he argued it should have been more strongly applied against Bulgaria. Powar says that in general he believes these sanctions work, that partial or full stadium closures do make a strong public statement, a broadcast humiliation and financial hit for a country or club. But he said Uefa should have jumped a step in the sanctions process, to expulsion from the tournament, because this is the third such incident of racism by Bulgarian “ultra” gangs this year, and there is an intensely worrying contagion of far-right hate in parts of Eastern Europe. The Liverpool player Rhian Brewster tweeted his dismay at the penalty for Nazi salutes and racism, saying “The world needs to wake up”.Yet English football fans competing for the weariest Uefa put-down might be wise to recall the reaction in Bulgaria of the English FA chairman, Greg Clarke. He declined to mount the high horse too readily, grimacing that we have a problem or two ourselves. The very next weekend the players of Haringey Borough did in north London what the England team declined to do in Bulgaria and walked off the pitch, after their goalkeeper, Valery Pajetat, said he had been racially abused by supporters of homely, West Country family club, Yeovil. A Manchester United supporter was thrown out of Old Trafford for allegedly racially abusing Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold, and subsequently banned. Police and club investigations were instigated into alleged abuse by Bristol City fans of supporters from Luton Town at their match in the Championship.The penalties for such inidual acts of racism are applied to the fans themselves, who may be banned or prosecuted, not to the clubs. That is perhaps understandable but the effect is that on the same evening that Uefa was being ridiculed and Bendtner’s pants were trending, Haringey Borough were preparing to replay their FA Cup fourth-round qualifying tie against Yeovil, like nothing ever happened.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsPowar is not alone in arguing that the anti-discrimination fight is being dangerously compromised, as Britain rudely departs from the European Union following a Leave campaign based on anti-immigrant lies and demonisation.Many Brexit proponents say they are not motivated by racism or xenophobia but hostility to other countries and their people has become acceptable and normal, indulged as our new national mission by government policy and a prime minister with a long-standing casual racism habit. Increasing incidents in football reflect this, and while Uefa’s regime should certainly explain itself, we should also, as football people say, have a long hard look at ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6023495e8717ded873c5ec2e7263265bfd3b9f0/0_4_3955_2373/master/3955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=677941ad5e67f79dea16a4ce06be52d5","title":"man city v southampton everton v watford carabao cup live","story":"Manchester City, Leicester, Everton, Oxford and Colchester all earned quarter-final spots on a night of occasional dramaAnd with that, my race is run. We’ll be back for a whole lot more tomorrow night. Bye!Here’s Paul Doyle’s report from the Pirelli Stadium:Leicester advanced to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals despite being spooked by Burton. Brendan Rodgers’ men seemed set to dish out another emphatic beating after goals by Kelechi Iheanacho and Youri Tielemans put them 2-0 up after 20 minutes. But rather than lie down like Southampton, the League One side rebelled, halving the deficit thanks to Liam Boyce and forcing Danny Ward to make several fine saves. James Maddison came off the bench to settle the tie in the 89th minute.Much more here:Extraordinary scenes at Oxford tonight: “We could actually hear the crowd at the Oxford United stadium cheering,” reports Mark Piesing. “We have never heard any sound from the stadium before.”Paul Wilson was at Goodison Park:Goals from Mason Holgate and Richarlison spared Marco Silva’s blushes against his former club and sent Everton into the last eight of the Carabao Cup, circumstances that will probably prevent the beleaguered manager being sacked in the morning, whatever the Watford fans present might have wished.Everton wore down their opponents in the end, though it was not the convincing performance Silva was seeking to impress his current employer or his old one. While Everton were on top by the time Holgate came up for a corner and stuck around to score the opening goal, they will have to play a lot better against Spurs at the weekend if they are to avoid a sixth league defeat in seven games. The Carabao Cup may not come to Silva’s rescue should that happen, for a side who take over an hour to score against Watford have no business dreaming of Wembley with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City still at large.Much more here:The quarter-final draw will be held this Thursday, live on Zoe Ball’s Breakfast Show on Radio 2, for some reason, at 8.45am.“I moved to Oxford for uni a couple of years ago,” boasts Alex Yeandle, “but am originally from Colchester.

Here’s Jamie Jackson at the Etihad:Manchester City took their unbeaten Carabao Cup run to 1,098 days in a near-stroll of a victory over a still-smarting Southampton. This was the visitors’ first game since Leicester trounced them 9-0 and it showed. Southampton did, at least, lose by only two goals and achieve against Pep Guardiola’s men what they failed to do against the Foxes – score – but until City slackened off towards the end they were too tentative.Much more here:The keeper goes the right way and makes an easy save!

Meanwhile at the Pirelli Stadium Demarai Gray is played through, takes the ball round the outrushing keeper, but his left-foot, side-footed shot is feeble and a defender clears.Gray has a hand in another goal, and Leicester wrap up the tie! The winger bursts down the right, gets to the byline and pulls back to Maddison, only recently off the bench, whose first-time shot goes in at the far post.Burton have a chance to equalise, but Sarkic appears to panic as the goalkeeper hares out towards him, and blasts over the bar.A cross from the right, and Luke Gambin controls brilliantly, turns and slams the ball into the roof of the net!An equaliser for Sunderland!

It’s a corner on the right which is deliciously flighted to the far post, where Jack Stephens thumps in a header!Everton hit the back of the net! Walcott gets the ball on the left of the area and crosses to Holgate, who is completely unmarked five yards out and can hardly miss!Southampton have had a shot on target! And three shots in total! A massive turnaround in their fortunes at the Etihad.Everton hit the woodwork again!

I loved all his designs and when he showed me this dress, I thought it was the perfect thing to wear for my 21st birthday party. It’s amazing that it has become so iconic everybody wants to wear it. I feel proud every time I see someone wearing a version of this look. When I moved to New York, I would always wear these outfits that stood out – no one was dressing that way – and now I see them everywhere. I love being a fashionista, it’s amazing to start trends and to see my picture on moodboards.Everything that Macdonald makes looks like it would be uncomfortable because it’s so intricate and crystalised, but his pieces are of such amazing quality that they are easy to wear. I love that he designs clothes that make you feel confident and beautiful.Growing up, I always had my own sense of style. I loved being unique and original and coming up with my own trends. I love the way Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham dress – they always look so chic and stylish. When I go to a party, I love to be glamorous and go all out I like to sparkle and feel amazing. However, my everyday wear is very comfortable. I love Juicy Couture’s velour tracksuits I probably own 100 of them in every colour. That’s my uniform when I’m chilling at home or going to the beach – anything that doesn’t involve a red carpet.I do have a signature look – I love pink and I love sparkles – but my style has changed over the years. I have been really influenced by my sister Nicky, whose style has always been the complete opposite of mine. I’ve learned to tone it down a little bit, be a little bit more understated sometimes. But it depends on the situation I’m a chameleon. I can show up in a Chanel suit, looking like a businesswoman, but if I’m at a party or Halloween or Burning Man, then I’m going all out.Paris Hilton’s 25th fragrance, Electrify, is available in the US and is coming to Europe in January 2020.

But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98f730f211af415ec50ec48704141d74dbe2f97c/1_105_804_483/master/804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83beffe7ebf573f89c1de6e9e19598b5","title":"brexit meltdown 50p coins with 31 october date to be recycled","story":"Decision over special-edition coins by Royal Mint comes as departure from EU is delayedThe 50p coins minted to commemorate Brexit on 31 October are to be “recycled”, the Treasury has confirmed.The decision comes after ministers agreed last week to “pause” production of the special-edition coin by the Royal Mint because of concerns that plans to leave the EU at the end of the month were unlikely to be fulfilled.It is understood that thousands of coins with Thursday’s date on them will be melted down and the metal kept aside until the next Brexit date is agreed.A Treasury spokesman said: “We will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the EU.”The coins were supposed to mark Britain’s departure at the end of the month but the Treasury told the Royal Mint to begin stockpiling last week.Officials waited before making a final decision about the coins until the EU heads of state agreed an extension to the Brexit deadline and it was clear that parliament would prevent the UK from crashing out without a deal on 31 October.Once an extension was agreed on Monday and No 10 had made it clear its preference was to have a general election, officials were given the all clear to prepare for a future Brexit date.About 3m coins were due to be ready to go into circulation under plans put in place by the chancellor, Sajid Javid. The coins bore the inscription “Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations”, above the leave date: 31 October 2019.The cost of designing and producing commemorative coins was met by the Mint out of its own revenues, the Treasury said, and the costs of recycling would also be met by the Mint.There was speculation that the thousands of coins minted so far could fetch a premium on the 50p cover price, possibly selling for as much as £800 each.However, Brexit coins bearing the October date “will now be recycled”, the Treasury said.Javid’s predecessor, Philip Hammond, had planned a limited edition of about 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for £10 each in time for the first deadline on 29 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9052c70af83976aa6cfb6e51c4e4036ac2ecbe48/0_15_1724_1034/master/1724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a069b208e3f2b643c611fdf6cb86c167","title":"brexit reduced to a petty squabble classic dom","story":"Johnson and Corbyn only cared about election timing – leaving this parliament to expire as it had lived. A laughing stockIt came down to a matter of days. Once Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, a man with both eyes on the top job had – as expected – chosen not to select amendments on EU citizens and votes for 16-year-olds, the only issue was about timing.The Tories wanted 12 December because that was the day they had first thought of and didn’t want to look like they were making any concessions. So tough. So brave. Classic Dom. Not wanting to be looking like the only leader too timid to vote for an election, Jeremy Corbyn muscled in on the Lib Dems and the SNP to insist that it took place on 9 December instead.Nine was the magic number. The only day that could possibly do. Partly because it would get darker three minutes later. But mainly because it wasn’t the date the Conservatives had picked. Too bad – 12 December it was. Brexit reduced to a petty squabble over something entirely trivial, because it was far too hard to consider the things that really mattered. This parliament was determined to expire as it had lived. A laughing stock.Proceedings had begun with Jacob Rees-Mogg putting forward a truncated programme motion to allow the government to pass its general election bill inside six hours. It was a simple matter, he said. For once he was almost telling the truth, as all the opposition parties had already indicated they would pretty much vote for whatever was put in front of them. Many MPs are now so Brexited out, they are incapable of rational thought. Rather, it’s become a race to be the last party to lose consciousness.Once Stella Creasy’s amendment to allow further amendments at the committee stage of the bill had been passed, it was over to Boris Johnson to open the debate. The Chronicle of a Death Foretold. The death in question being that of the entire UK, which was about to get six weeks of the same mediocrities telling the same lies and making the same unverifiable claims. The cruellest of punishments for a country hellbent on slipping out of the G7.In his dreams – those private moments he spends in front of the mirror, serenading the person he loves best – the prime minister is the master orator. The man with the golden voice who can charm all those with whom he comes in contact. The reality is that he struggles for coherence, his voice barking out subconscious pleas for help via morse code. A speaker who can just about scrape by as a feelgood after-dinner turn, recycling the same tired gags, but lacks the sincerity and concentration to survive sustained scrutiny. The only thing he really cares about is himself.Johnson had opened on auto-pilot. Labour had blocked Brexit by forcing him to have a massive sulk once MPs had insisted on having more than three days to debate his withdrawal agreement. The extension to the end of January would cost the UK an extra £1bn per month. Both statements blatantly untrue, but sure to be dragged out in every stump speech throughout the election campaign until enough people – possibly even Boris himself, if his lack of conscience allowed – came to accept as fact.As so often, Johnson then began to get bored with saying the same stuff he had said the day before and the day before that. So he just ad-libbed. The Commons chamber is really only an extension of the Oxford Union for him, with Tory backbenchers merely fawning acolytes. If anything, his contempt for his own MPs exceeds that for the opposition. There was no apology for breaking a commitment he had made to leave – “do or die” – by 31 October. Just a long moan about how difficult Brexit had become. It was the most passionate argument in favour of remain anyone was to make all day. Classic Dom.Corbyn had more than enough fantasies of his own. It was a complete lie that Labour had consistently resisted the chance to contest an election. The party had been gagging for one all along and it was only the absurd contortions of the Tories that had prevented one. Then he went into full stump mode. This wasn’t an election about Brexit. It was an election about public services and austerity. No one on the Labour front bench could quite bring themselves to break it to their leader that the entire reason the election was taking place was because of Brexit. The other stuff was nice and worth a mention but this was a Brexit election.Unbelievably, these opening speeches were pretty much the highpoint. Ian Blackford merely shrugged and said an election was a win-win for the SNP. If the Tories were defeated then all well and good but if they won then Scottish independence was one step closer. Bill Cash merely gave the edited highlights of all his speeches over the past 40 years. He won’t be missed. Not even by himself.“I’m going to carry on with my thoughts,” declared the Tory Vicky Ford to the astonishment of the five MPs left in the house. Because it hadn’t been obvious up till then that she had had any. One can only feel sorry for her constituents. Bob Seely wondered out loud why no one appeared to trust Boris before realising he had answered his own question. Because he’s Boris.The one standout moment was a passionate defence of futility from Labour’s Jess Phillips. The coming election would not answer any of the questions that had precipitated it. People would interpret the results to suit their own ends, she argued, and Brexit wouldn’t be resolved for years.All that was happening was that MPs had run out of ideas. An election was an admission of collective failure. Unable to resolve their differences, MPs had turned their sights on each other. A collective act of self-harm.

The Conservatives start the campaign with a 10-point poll lead, a margin that translates into an overall majority of about 58 for Boris Johnson, according to estimates produced by Electoral Calculus.If anything, the latest Brexit wrangling has benefited the Conservatives, extending the party’s lead by two points since 1 October, even as it became increasingly clear that Johnson’s “do or die” Halloween deadline would be missed.Certainly, the Conservative strategy for an election campaign looks simple enough – “let’s get Brexit done” – an appeal that plays to the idea that the nation is worn out by Westminster’s endless battles.That contrasts with the opposition’s argument, easy to portray as overly complex: vote Labour, negotiate a new deal and have referendum on the deal the party just negotiated. It is a promise of more Brexit debate and no certain final outcome.Labour’s best hope is to reset the agenda, if it can convince the electorate that Brexit is not so important. It worked in 2017, largely because voters thought the UK’s exit was a foregone conclusion, but will be harder this time around.In a campaign, the opposition knows it can draw on a suite of policies beyond where the Conservatives can go: renationalisation, free student education, tax increases for wealthy earners and perhaps on public spending, although here Johnson has tried to blunt the anti-austerity attack with pledges on schools spending and police numbers.Labour is way ahead among those aged 18 to 34, where student finance looms large, according to Ipsos Mori, although that is more than offset by a clear Conservative lead among the over 55s and a marginal lead among 35- to 54-year-olds. Pledges made to pensioners and older working age voters by both sides will be critical – particularly after the Tory disaster of the dementia tax in 2017.That would, however, amount to an 11 point gain from the Lib Dems’ dismal showing in 2017 and an extra 18 seats on an even swing. But, barring something unforeseen, it remains hard to see how they can win significantly more than 30 seats, up from 12 last time.For Johnson, margins are finer still. If the Tories lose all its 13 seats in Scotland to the Scottish National party – a distinct possibility given the polling there – it needs to gain 21 to get to an overall majority of 326. Other Tory seats in London and, to a lesser extent south-west England, could be at risk, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c027744a6f3e272e8cc19cc28120ab19ec9fd0cf/0_131_5183_3110/master/5183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199e6d52615d8266460def1db496815d","title":"how do i register to vote in the 12 december 2019 general election","story":"With MPs voting to call an election on 12 December, there’s still time to make sure your voice is heardTo vote in a UK general election you must:You also need to be on the electoral register.

For tactical reasons, you might decide it is better to vote in one location or the other – for example, you might usually live in a marginal seat, and your university address might be in a safe seat, or vice-versa.One further complication this time around – Thursday 12 December is close to when term finishes, so you might already have travelled home. But there is nothing stopping you applying for a postal vote in your university constituency if you want to vote there.There are two ways to vote if you can’t be there to vote in person on the day of an election – with either a postal vote or a proxy vote. To apply for a postal or proxy vote you must already be registered to vote and on the electoral roll.Voting by proxy A proxy vote means someone can vote on your behalf. Anyone can act as your proxy provided they’re registered to vote and allowed to vote in the same type of election.Usually, you need to apply for a proxy vote at least six working days before election day if you want to vote in England, Scotland or Wales – ie before 5 December.

We’re a laughing stock abroad,” said Deb Metcalf, 52, after the lunchtime rush in the town’s bakery. Metcalf said she was fed up that Brexit had not been delivered and that some – including this area’s Labour MP, James Frith – were arguing for a second referendum. “It would be a massive slap in the country’s face. I know a lot of people are peed off with him because he’s gone against everyone’s wishes.”In Alternative Arrangements, a flower shop down the road, 72-year-old Anne said Brexit was “making people depressed” and that a pre-Christmas poll would drive people up the wall. “In eight months’ time this will have taken as long as the first world war – that was on for four years and three months,” she said, clutching her shopping bags. “It’s quite frankly doing my head in.”It is leave-voting Labour seats like Bury North that will be high on the Tories’ target list in the coming weeks. In a marginal seat that has swapped from blue to red twice in its 35-year history, Frith was elected two years ago with a majority of 4,375. Speaking after Labour’s backing for an election on Tuesday, Frith acknowledged it was not “top of everyone’s Christmas list” but that voters understood the parliamentary deadlock and that a national poll was “inevitable, sooner or later”.Frith said he was confident he would keep his seat if he won the backing of those who supported him in 2017, despite figures suggesting the Brexit party came out on top here in the European parliamentary elections in May.In Plentiful, a shop selling plastic-free goods, Sharon Henley Hewitt, 64, said the country needed to focus on bigger things than another election, namely the climate emergency and overhauling the voting system. “It’s representative of the broken system we’re in that we need another general election at this time, but if it means we get rid of this current government then I think it’s great,” she said.Olchon Lang, a gallery owner, said he was concerned about voter turnout in a winter poll, especially in this bitingly-cold and often-dark corner of the Pennine Moors. “It’s the wrong time of year to do it,” he said. “It’s going to be dark and quite a lot of our older people are going to struggle to get to polling stations. Possibly it will sway the electorate to the young people.”Nonsense, said Elizabeth Benson, 69, and her husband Alan, 79. “Bring it on – that’s what I think. We will be voting for the Tories and we want out,” said Elizabeth. “It’s a disaster but I don’t think it’s Boris’s fault – it’s parliament. Whatever he tries to do they’re stopping him.” Josh HallidayFor 33-year-old Jamie Bourn, who works in a homewares shop in Chingford, north-east London, an election can’t come quickly enough. “I think we’ll just carry on going around in circles like we are now if we don’t have an election,” he said on Tuesday afternoon, following the announcement that Labour would back a pre-Christmas poll.“I voted remain – I thought we were getting along nicely in the EU – but I think it’s time to leave. That’s what everyone voted for. It’s not something I agree with, but it was a decision made by the majority of the public.”Homes and Gardens, a few minutes from Chingford station, has seen a few heated debates about Brexit over the past three years, says Bourn, “but that hasn’t happened so much lately because people are fed up with it”.Safer, who voted leave in the EU referendum, didn’t have strong opinions about Duncan Smith – “He’s all right. He came in and wanted to use my loo once” – but said he would back the Conservatives in the election, and expected them to win.“I’d very surprised if they were calling a general election and weren’t confident they were going to win,” he said. “This area is full of old Tories, so I can’t see Labour winning here.”Mary Jenkins, 87 – another Tory supporter who voted to leave the EU – said the debate around Brexit had been dragging on too long. “In the end it gets boring,” she said. “It has taken up a lot of my time because I live on my own and I put the TV on to see what’s on the news and you get hypnotised by it.”Her message to politicians: “Get on with it before I kick the bucket.” Frances Perraudin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21d57dac1e4990db1731ac5124258ef204b1a3bb/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=001b71f6bb84d63b9d8056ebab5163ba","title":"lib dem mp heidi allen stand down next general election","story":"Ex-Tory says ‘nastiness and intimidation’ she has endured behind decision to quit politicsThe Liberal Democrat MP Heidi Allen will not stand at the next general election, citing the “nastiness and intimidation” she has endured as a politician as being behind her decision to quit.The former Tory, who defected to Change UK before joining the Lib Dems on 7 October, said in a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire: “I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace. Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.“Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all too regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising. I have reluctantly come to the decision that I will not re-stand when the next general election comes.“I am heartbroken, but I know it is the right decision because I am no longer delivering the change that drove me into politics in the first place.”The 44-year-old defected to the fledgling political organisation Change UK in February alongside her fellow Tories Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. She had been a longstanding critic of austerity and other Tory welfare policies since her election in 2015 and was a vocal part of the pro-remain faction within the party.When Change UK became an official political party she acted as leader but after failing to win any seats at the European elections, splits started to emerge over the party’s future direction.

The prime minister has promised to abide by existing standards to maintain “the level playing field” the EU requires to negotiate a free-trade agreement.Barnier said maintaining “fair” competition, rather than “wild” deregulation, was in the interests of the UK, and he warned that the EU-UK free-trade deal could be blocked by any one of three dozen national or regional parliaments. “Don’t underestimate the difficulties of the process of ratification,” he said, referring to the trade deal, but also other agreements the UK must negotiate in the coming years. “If it is not ratified, we return to zero.”Speaking in his first interview since being appointed one week ago to lead the EU’s taskforce on future relations with the UK, Barnier also said:Barnier was speaking shortly before parliament debated a snap December election that would deepen the uncertainty over Brexit.Brexit is scheduled for 31 January at the latest, leaving the UK just 11 months to negotiate a future relationship that covers trade, security, foreign policy and numerous technical topics, including transport and fisheries.Barnier said the EU would be ready to launch negotiations on the future “the day after” the withdrawal agreement was ratified. His team would prioritise trade and security among other topics, while some subjects would take more time. “We cannot do everything in 11 months, we will need more time,” he said.In a potentially helpful intervention for Johnson, Barnier said it would be possible to negotiate “the principle elements” of a free-trade agreement to avoid an economic cliff edge before the end of 2020.Barnier disagreed with suggestions that extending the transition period was inevitable, but said the UK would have to pay a “proportional” contribution to the EU budget to remain in the single market beyond 2020. The withdrawal agreement allows a one-off extension of either one or two years.Barnier said Brexit talks had taken longer than the EU expected, adding that “due to the British political situation we are obliged to be patient”.He now has a one-year, renewable mandate to oversee the EU’s future ties with the EU. European leaders were impatient to end “this negative negotiation of separation and orce and to open a new page on the future relations” he said. “And we are preparing for this. We are ready for this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eefc17e67555b201f66abe6883c501ca0344162/0_0_3552_2132/master/3552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00d5c7fd125afeb97392aaa48416a887","title":"peoples vote standoff escalates as staff confront chairman","story":"Most staff say they have no confidence in Roland Rudd after he fired two executivesThe standoff at People’s Vote has escalated after about 40 staff called for the resignation of their chairman, Roland Rudd, who has sacked two senior executives and was planning to make a number of new appointments later on Tuesday.The bulk of staff working on the campaign for a second referendum went to confront Rudd at a meeting in a hotel, after he fired James McGrory as campaign director and Tom Baldwin as media director over the weekend.The staff had believed they were to meet Rudd, a City PR firm boss, in their Millbank offices in London on Tuesday morning, with McGrory and Baldwin having vowed to turn up to work as usual.However, Rudd changed the location to the Hilton hotel next door and staff supportive of the sacked executives initially declined to attend. They later moved en masse to the Hilton, where security guards denied entry to Baldwin and McGrory.Following the meeting with Rudd and his new acting chief executive, Patrick Heneghan, 40 staff members said they had no confidence in Rudd and called on him to quit, while three came out in favour.McGrory, who still describes himself as director of People’s Vote, said: “We are asking Rudd and Heneghan to quit because no one – least of all the millions of people in the country who are desperate for us to succeed – can allow boardroom politics to overshadow the real politics taking place on Brexit.“This has been a brilliant cross-party campaign and this is a crucial week in the fight to stop Boris Johnson forcing his Brexit on the people. We are ready to launch the biggest and most sophisticated tactical voting campaign this country has ever seen if there is an election.“But Roland Rudd has chosen now to put a wrecking ball through the campaign, locked key staff out of the office and tied others up in legal threats.“All we want to do is get back to campaigning for a People’s Vote. None of us chose to get into a fight with the Open Britain board. Instead, those seeking to disable this extraordinary campaign must now take responsibility for playing into Johnson’s hands.”In a letter sent to Rudd on Monday night, the 40 staff told him: “As the staff of the People’s Vote campaign, we demand you allow us to continue with our work under the leadership of James and Tom. This campaign has always been about trusting the people. If you want us to succeed, you must trust us now.”A People’s Vote source said Rudd had not wanted to be “ambushed” at the Millbank offices by people prepared to film him, but that he had waited in the hotel with tea and coffee for anyone who wanted to discuss the management changes. They said the Hilton meeting room was used regularly and the staff had been issued with “direct orders from the chief executive and chairman” to attend.Rudd and Heneghan were expected to announce more staff appointments later on Tuesday.One person on Rudd’s side said concerns about the management of the organisation had been fuelled by a report by some consultants last year. In the report, quotes from those who worked in the campaign included: “There are dozens of people who have not done a full day of work in weeks. You end up getting shouted at in a meeting so you just go home.”Another read: “It’s a completely unworkable, dysfunctional campaign at the moment. I have never been part of one that has so little accountability.”On the other side, some senior People’s Vote figures supportive of McGrory and Baldwin said the dysfunctional structure was a result of Rudd’s control over the campaign through its parent organisation, Open Britain.One board member also disputed the idea that Rudd had been trying to improve its governance by merging it with other pro-European organisations, saying this had been the idea of the campaign’s management.They pointed to an email to Rudd in August in which four People’s Vote constituent organisations said they wanted a “shared ownership of the campaign across all the organisations involved and accountability to its members”, and rejected Rudd’s “proposal for a new campaign controlled by Open Britain” as unacceptable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab1929d0534b54c3b67ad53d21684f17ba4c274a/0_109_5183_3111/master/5183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ad7c6add9405754cf0b60a7ad3de27a","title":"time to reassess a corbyn led labour partys chances in the next election","story":"Too much time has been spent worrying about Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity, and by implication Labour’s electability. Like many others who are optimistic and positive about Labour’s likely offer to the electorate, I’ve found myself getting sucked into this displacement activity, when it would be far better to be challenging the substance of the government’s performance since Johnson arrived in Downing Street three months ago.Polly Toynbee’s withering critique of his government’s record, coupled with a challenge to the view, peddled by obedient commentators, that Labour voters are now ready to back a ided, inconsistent and mediocre Tory party, lifted me above the standard narrative – that Labour is doomed, unless and until there is a change of leader (Even if the Tories win an election they will be finished, Journal, 29 October).Maybe they are currently hiding their light under a bushel, but I doubt that many Tory candidates, or the manifesto on which they will stand, will show any understanding of – or sympathy for – the problems confronting those whose lives have been blighted by austerity. When the election comes, let’s hope that it will be possible to see through the Brexit fog.Les BrightExeter, Devon• Polly Toynbee makes interesting comments, but falls into the trap of exaggerating the Labour standing across the UK. She says 30-year-olds are twice as likely to vote Labour. But where? Certainly not in Scotland, where Labour has sunk below the radar at all levels of government. The famed “duopoly” are not functioning well north of the Tweed either, and Scotland can no longer be shoehorned into the UK political landscape south of the Tweed. In fact, after the joint statements made recently by Nicola Sturgeon and the Labour Welsh first minister, Labour in Wales is developing a less metropolitan focus in relation to an indyref2.Polly Toynbee seems to forget that there are other parties and nations of the present UK represented at Westminster, which can and have altered the cosy duopolistic hegemony.John EdgarKilmaurs, Ayrshire• My goodness, why can’t your contributors see what the rest of the country sees and address the nub of the matter? The electorate will not vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be our prime minister – he is not up to it. Polly Toynbee and Tom Kibasi (The polls may seem dismal. But here’s how Labour could win a general election, 28 October) seem gloriously unaware of this. Bash Johnson all you like, but that’s not the problem. Labour’s problem is internal. Their inability to select an electable prime minister will be the key to Labour losing a lot of seats – remember Ed Miliband? Lesley GoreIlkley, West Yorkshire• Your correspondents agreeing with Jonathan Freedland’s criticism of Jeremy Corbyn as leader neglect one important element (Letters, 28 October). Whoever leads the Labour party with a manifesto that explicitly ditches neoliberal economics and supports Palestinian rights will receive very much the same treatment as Corbyn. Ed Miliband’s stance was much less radical, but look at the treatment he received – and he lost badly. Tony Blair received the backing of the Murdoch papers, and thus a good public image, because he negotiated a deal with Murdoch. He was allowed to be elected as long as he followed the same economic path as the Tories.Hazel Davies Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside • Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

He originally proposed 12 December, which would have allowed a few more days for MPs to debate his withdrawal agreement bill, and tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.That plan failed to win the backing of the required two-thirds of MPs in the House of Commons on Monday night, with Labour abstaining, but Johnson immediately announced he would table a one-line bill, again calling for a 12 December election.This would require a simple majority to pass, and echoes a plan put forward by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party at the weekend, though they preferred a 9 December date.Corbyn’s party has agonised about whether to support a pre-Christmas poll. The Labour leader has been keen to hit the campaign trail, but some members of the shadow cabinet were very reluctant.Some had hoped a second referendum could have been secured first, while others would have liked to see Johnson’s Brexit deal debated and agreed, to allow Labour to focus on domestic policies during a campaign.But Corbyn eventually prevailed and Labour will now back a December election.Students may have broken up for Christmas by 12 December and it could be harder to get this cohort to vote if they are travelling between two locations. Corbyn brought this point up with Johnson at the dispatch box on Monday night and was heckled by Conservative MPs.Daylight hours are reduced and in Scotland it is dark at 4pm, or earlier on some of the islands. Some MPs say they are reluctant to go out campaigning in the cold and dark.The Conservatives say they do not want MPs to try to amend it and risk the bill being stuck in endless parliamentary gridlock.Some of Johnson’s advisers, particularly those who are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, have been pressing for an early poll, hoping they can capitalise on the prime minister’s success in securing a deal with the EU and Labour’s discomfort about its Brexit stance.The Lib Dems and the SNP proposed an election on Monday 9 December to ensure the government had no time to bring its Brexit deal back. They have also warned about the risk of students being disenfranchised.The Lib Dem MP Chuka Umunna said the party was not prepared to accept the 12 December proposal. “If you have the 12th, it presents an opportunity for the government to get their withdrawal agreement bill through,” he said.“The reason the 9th is preferable is because it would stop them from bringing forward their withdrawal bill and completing its passage through the Commons.”The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the date was not realistic as 25 working days were needed between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. Parliament would have to be dissolved on Friday, while also securing royal assent for the election bill, and passing a Northern Irish budget bill, which could be very difficult.The SNP and the Lib Dems were warmer on 10 or 11 December than 12 December. Labour has suggested it is likely to back efforts to amend the date, but the party is unlikely to withdraw support from the government’s election bill as a result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7938781c558f20447f8c70b5f2c41c3f41624134/0_108_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db8ae9c8826391353634907a49c3914","title":"uk general election confirmed for 12 december after brexit stalemate","story":"Boris Johnson wins vote to secure snap poll at fourth time of asking MPs voted on Tuesday night to finally resolve their Brexit deadlock by calling a general election, setting the stage for a 12 December contest that could be the most unpredictable in a generation.Boris Johnson won his fourth bid to go to the polls by 438 to 20 after Jeremy Corbyn declared that Labour would support an election as a “once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country”. The pre-Christmas vote will be the first December poll since 1923.The Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party abstained, after their preferred day for it to be held – 9 December – was rejected. Almost half of all Labour MPs were absent or voted against the legislation in a sign of unhappiness about a snap election, although some blamed a mix-up by the whips for their failure to attend.Parliament will dissolve next Wednesday for a short campaign of five weeks, so long as the House of Lords passes Johnson’s legislation as expected in the coming days.Corbyn set the stage for his campaign by calling on voters to kick out Johnson’s Conservatives who think they are “born to rule”, while Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, said it was “our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit”.Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, Johnson argued that a “new and revitalised” parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union. “We are left with no choice but to go to the country to break free from this impasse,” he told MPs.But he later struck a cautious note, telling a backbench meeting of Tory MPs that it would be “a tough election but we will do the best we can”. He told them he had not wanted an election but was forced to seek one because Labour would have “sliced and diced” his Brexit legislation beyond recognition.In a move to unite his party, the prime minister decided to readmit 10 of the 21 MPs he expelled last month for defying his Brexit plan.The major battle lines of the campaign will be drawn along on the subject of Brexit, after Johnson failed to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October “do or die” as he had promised.The Conservatives will campaign to get Brexit done by pushing through Johnson’s deal, while Labour is promising a second referendum to let the people resolve the EU question.The Brexit party will try to outgun the Tories by arguing for a no-deal Brexit, while the Lib Dems will seek to attract remain voters from Labour by pledging to revoke article 50.Although parliament voted decisively for an election, many backbenchers in the two biggest parties are extremely nervous about going to the polls at such a politically volatile time and an unusual time of year. The Tories under Johnson are about 10 points ahead of Labour in the average polls, roughly half the lead that Theresa May had before she led her party to a disastrous result that saw her lose her majority.Labour has been deeply split for months about whether to back an election or a second referendum first. In a sign of reluctance on the backbenches, more than 100 Labour MPs abstained and 11 voted against the motion. Those rejecting an election included strongly pro-remain campaigners such as Margaret Beckett, Peter Kyle, David Lammy and Owen Smith, who later said he would be standing down.Speaking earlier in the Commons, Corbyn confirmed that the party would back a poll after rejecting one on three previous occasions, after getting confirmation that the EU had granted an extension to article 50.“I’m ready for it, we’re ready for it,” Corbyn said. “Because we want to be able to say to the people of this country there is an alternative to austerity. There is an alternative to inequality. There is an alternative to sweetheart trade deals with Donald Trump.”Polling experts have said the result is likely to be hard to gauge, with the British Election Survey suggesting a third of voters have switched parties in the last two elections.The Tories will be targeting leave-voting Labour marginal constituencies in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, while defending areas of the south-west against the Lib Dems and its seats in Scotland against the SNP.Labour will be hoping to build on its successes in 2017 at picking up marginal seats from the Tories, especially in remain-voting urban areas. Corbyn’s campaign will also be bolstered by the leftwing activists in Momentum, who are planning to mobilise tens of thousands of people to knock on doors in marginal seats and launch a “viral video response unit” to reach millions online.The Lib Dems have been speaking to the Greens and Plaid Cymru about maximising the chances of pro-remain parties, by standing single “Stop Brexit” candidates in certain seats. However, the number of these is likely to be limited.Paula Surridge, a political sociologist at the University of Bristol, said the 12 December election was “likely to pose key challenges to both the Labour and Conservative parties, both of whom need to improve on their performance in terms of seats, while simultaneously unlikely to match their 2017 vote share”.“Who manages to hold on to the larger part of the 2017 votes is likely to form the next government. Will this be the Brexit election 2017 never quite managed to be? The Liberal Democrats and the Brexit party will be pushing hard to make it so, while Labour are likely to want to talk about almost anything else,” she said.In its remaining days of business, the government is planning to hold a debate on the Grenfell Tower fire report and rush through legislation relating to Northern Ireland’s budget. However, it is still unclear whether a vote on the new Commons Speaker will be able to take place on Monday, as many MPs will be heading back to campaign immediately and are likely to be reluctant to return.The candidates for the job are split as to whether to press ahead, with Lindsay Hoyle, the favourite, and Meg Hillier, pushing for it to happen, while Chris Bryant, Harriet Harman, Rosie Winterton and Eleanor Laing, would prefer a new parliament to decide. John Bercow, the outgoing Speaker, could decide to defer his decision to stand down and allow the new parliament to elect his successor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8966c127a79390328f092c4a1a5a47a75565b7/0_105_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeff1cbb93ab406d079e98fdd191e8c2","title":"have you experienced weekend loneliness share your experiences","story":"If you’re single and struggle with weekend loneliness, we’d like to hear from you We’d like to understand more about whether weekend loneliness is on the rise among single people and especially in big cities where it can be harder to feel a sense of community.

Instead she claimed Freeman had got the testosterone at the request of Shane Sutton, who at the time was the head coach of Team Sky and British Cycling. In his witness statement, Sutton denied knowledge of the delivery and denied the testosterone was intended for him.Freeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017 before resigning, is also expected to accept he made false statements and that he failed to keep proper medical records. Some of those were on a laptop containing, among other things, details of the contents of the mystery “Jiffy bag” delivered from British Cycling’s headquarters in Manchester to the Team Sky bus at the 2011 Critérium du Dauphiné. The lap-top was stolen in August 2014 and the contents had not been backed up.O’Rourke conceded that her client had “told a lot of lies” in previous statements to the GMC, which has brought the case against him, and UK Anti-Doping.Quoting Freeman, who was sitting alongside her at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing in Manchester, she added: “I couldn’t bring myself to tell the truth, even to my lawyers. I am here now and this is the truth.”Freeman faces losing his doctor’s licence if the tribunal finds against him in a case that was postponed in February because of his ill health. While Freeman now accepts many of the charges against him, O’Rourke denied his motive was to acquire testosterone for a rider to improve performance. “The GMC aren’t going to believe whatever he says, they are bent on saying it was doping,” she said.O’Rourke added the only GMC witness she required to cross-examine was Sutton, who was also the personal coach to the 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins. The GMC will call on an expert endocrinologist and will say that Sutton had no medical problem that needed Testogel and to prescribe it would have been “inappropriate”.Simon Jackson QC, for the GMC, also urged the panel to look at the history of what had been said by Freeman before the submission of his statement in September to highlight what it deems to be inconsistencies.The tribunal accepted Freeman could be shielded from the press while giving evidence – and also screened from Sutton, if he appears in front of the tribunal. O’Rourke also took exception to a proposed GMC amendment to the charges from suggesting Freeman’s motive was to supply the Testogel to an athlete to saying Freeman knew or ought to have known this was a possibility.But Jackson said the burden of proof had not changed and the amendment reflected updates from Freeman.Jackson also took exception to O’Rourke’s description of her client as a “jobbing GP” – pointing out Freeman had worked in senior jobs in football and cycling. “He is on the GMC register as a specialist in sports medicine before he started at British Cycling and Team Sky he had been at Bolton Wanderers as a doctor to the youth academy, and in that role he had a specific brief to deal with anti-doping.”A GMC investigation originally drew up 22 allegations against Freeman, including ordering testosterone, administering testosterone, making false statements and asking the supplier to support his assertions the drug was delivered in error. Freeman is now contesting only three of the charges.The tribunal is in camera making its decision on the GMC’s application to amend the allegation. It is due to reconvene on Tuesday 5 November and is scheduled to run until 20 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/437756d3cfc151da550321aa0ca5eab8cdcd48e3/0_39_1845_1107/master/1845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71aeefc75b6c8717a03e8d845353b419","title":"broadway theatre new york american politics","story":"In an era of uncertainty and anxiety, New York theatre is shunning its obsession with private lives to throw a powerful spotlight on politicsIt used to be argued that British drama is driven by a fascination with public affairs and its American counterpart by a preoccupation with private lives. On the evidence of a week’s intensive theatregoing in New York, I would suggest that hoary generalisation has been blown to smithereens. At a time of potential impeachment, political polarisation and profound uncertainty, American theatre seems to be heavily engaged with the wider world.The most surprising – and controversial – new play I encountered was Will Arbery’s Heroes of the Fourth Turning at Playwrights Horizons. It offers a direct rebuttal to the stock charge that modern drama simply reflects the liberal assumptions of the theatregoing audience. Arbery writes about a group of deeply conservative Catholic friends who meet in Wyoming for the installation of a new president at their old college. The play neither caricatures nor cauterises these figures. It shows them to be passionate, articulate and as capable of quoting Hannah Arendt as Heidegger. At the same time, it suggests they are just as ided as any other section of modern American society.What is startling is their vehemence. The most extreme figure is Teresa who admires Steve Bannon and is excited by the idea of a war to save western civilisation. Her ex-lover, Justin, sees proximity to LGBT people as a threat to Christian children and advocates training in marksmanship for the college’s students. But Arbery also presents us with the alcoholic Kevin who feels spiritually empty, and the more rapturous Emily who worked for an anti-abortion women’s organisation helping domestic abuse victims. Everyone, it seems, loves Emily except her mother, the newly elected president, who turns up at this outdoor drinks party and argues for a return to religious orthodoxy.If anything unites these squabbling Catholics, it is their dislike of President Trump who is variously described as “a gross monster” and “chemotherapy”. But Arbery’s main point is that there seems to be a malaise affecting the whole of the United States of which these fervent rightwing Catholics are yet one more symptom. Arbery overdoes the symbolism – as with a noisily explosive generator that echoes the breaking string in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. But his play is robustly challenging and Danya Taymor’s production boasts a fine Edward Hopper-like set from Laura Jellinek and striking performances from Zoë Winters as the poster girl for the new apocalypse and Julia McDermott as the sickly Emily.If Arbery’s play offers little in the way of comfort, Soft Power at the Public Theater addresses the nation’s ills with the breezy bounce you expect in a musical. It has a strong pedigree in that the play and lyrics are by David Henry Hwang (M Butterfly) and the score by Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change). The framework is complicated and derives from a street stabbing in which Hwang was the victim. But what we see is a fantasy musical that he imagines in his fevered post-op dreams and that offers a parodic inversion of The King and I. Instead of a British governess lecturing a Siamese monarch we see a Chinese film producer, Xue Xing, arriving in America and offering a lesson in civics and good governance to Hillary Clinton.There are some genuinely funny numbers, including one where Xue tries to teach the stiff-lipped Clinton (neatly played by Alyse Alan Louis) how to pronounce his name. As the all-Asian chorus line, bewigged to resemble standard Broadway hoofers, strut their stuff, we realise just how offensive it is when, as more often happens, occidental actors play oriental roles. But the virtue of the show is that it pins down the current American crisis with jaunty irony. “The ballot box has thrown your country into chaos,” claims the communist Xue. While Clinton agrees, she plangently sings that you have to stick with democracy. She even finally endorses a Chinese proverb that proclaims: “Good fortune will follow if we somehow survive.”While Hwang’s musical and Arbery’s play deal with the current crisis, Robert Schenkkan’s The Great Society at the Vivian Beaumont looks back to the historic past: specifically to the last years of Lyndon Johnson’s presidency from 1965 to 1968. What is immediately striking, in sharp contrast to today, is the moral purpose that drove LBJ and his success in getting, with the help of Republicans in the Senate, both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act on to the statute book. But, as shown by Christopher Hampton’s 2013 play Appomattox – which has sadly never been seen in Britain – LBJ was one of the great tragic heroes of modern times. A progressive politician and genuine idealist, who got 104 bills through Congress, will always be defined by his disastrous escalation of the war in Vietnam. Brian Cox, who plays Johnson in Bill Rauch’s energetic production, doesn’t look much like the man himself but it is still a titanic performance that captures LBJ’s political guile and ingenuity as well as his descent from a great height.Not all New York plays are overtly political. I caught an intriguing work by Adam Rapp, The Sound Inside, about the odd relationship between Bella, a 53-year-old professor of creative writing at Yale, and a young student, Christopher, who has a passion for Dostoyevsky. Rapp keeps you on tenterhooks as to the real reason for the couple’s extra-curricular friendship and, in a highly literary play, makes a number of shrewd points. One is that fiction is, more often than not, camouflaged autobiography. Another is that, in today’s world, readers (and theatre audiences) crave elliptical conclusions. Mary-Louise Parker is brilliant as the self-contained, solitary Bella and Will Hochman suggests a dark undertow to her inquisitive student. I only hope that if David Cromer’s production makes it to London, as it surely will, it finds a more intimate space than Broadway’s Studio 54. But this is a fine play that, even if not directly about public affairs, proves that uncertainty is the defining condition of modern life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8402bb961cccd87a228d1918846d878eac9ed3f9/0_480_2140_1284/master/2140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1488d8bece814087164799bb43e31ad","title":"how smart tech can put us on track to sustainable travel","story":"People are willing to change their travel habits for the good of the environment. From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home.

It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

So other! So extraordinarily strange!” So said Sue Perkins as she walked across Tokyo’s most crowded zebra crossing in the opening sequence of her travelogue. But shouldn’t this all be more familiar by now?After all, BBC One’s Japan With Sue Perkins, which aired last month, was only the latest in a long run of British TV programmes inviting us to boggle at the east Asian country. These shows always feature a shot of the aforementioned Shibuya Crossing, items on AI and sumo wrestling, and a concerned interview with an undersexed young man (sometimes called otaku) andor an overexcited young woman (something to do with kawaii). Only rarely do they offer fresh insight.At least the upcoming Queer Eye: We’re in Japan! on Netflix and BBC Two’s drama GiriHaji have obeyed the most basic rule of making British TV about Japan: don’t name it after that slightly racist 1980s hit about masturbation. That’s where Channel 5’s Justin Lee Collins: Turning Japanese went wrong. Or rather, it was the first of many wrong turns in which the since-disgraced comic’s 2011 travelogue erred.TV’s other orientalist missteps are less daft, but more common. The premise of Queer Eye – five sophisticates makeover a sad-sack – puts Karamo Brown in danger of doing an accidental “Lawrence of Arabia” when he arrives in Tokyo. That is, updating the colonial yarn of the westerner who is eventually accepted by an alien community and then asserts his inherent superiority by embodying the culture better than the locals. Happily, Queer Eye has addressed that risk by including Kiko Mizuhara, a Japanese-American model and Tokyo resident as its guide.The illuminating presence of Mizuhara is, however, unusual. “British television programmes have a tendency to represent Japanese people as stereotypically odd or kooky, without explaining the cultural context,” says Professor Perry R Hinton, an expert in intercultural communication.This kind of othering reveals a narrow-mindedness. As Shinichi Adachi, the Japanese-British film-maker behind YouTube culinary series The Wagyu Show explains, Japanese culture isn’t particularly strange, just more accepting of humanity’s strangeness. “They respect people, even if they don’t understand them. People don’t really care if others have weird hobbies.”Another big contextual omission is Japanese self-awareness. A regular set-up in Perkins’s show involves her making wry observations while her hosts look on, blank-faced from the edge of the frame, presumably excluded from the joke by the language barrier. She’s not the only one. Similar interactions took place in No Sex Please, We’re Japanese (BBC Two, 2013), Joanna Lumley’s Japan (ITV, 2016), Adam and Joe Go Tokyo (BBC Three, 2003), and even in Jonathan Ross’s generally respectful Japanorama series (BBC ChoiceBBC Three, 2002-7).But Japan is in on the joke. Indeed, they’re the ones who cracked it in the first place. Hinton gives the gameshow Endurance as an example. First introduced to British audiences via Clive James on Television, then Tarrant on TV (1982-2006), it began a fascination with Japanese gameshows that has continued through Takeshi’s Castle and the controversial E4 spoof Banzai, which Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans described as “an Asian minstrel show”. Yet all this revelling in gameshow exotica was born out of a subtle mistranslation. Hinton points out that the word “endurance” has a particular connotation in Japanese culture, akin to “stiff upper lip”, with roots in the resilience required for post-second world war reconstruction. “Rather than Endurance representing Japanese otherness, it showed a confidence in being able to mock one’s own national character, similar to Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” says Hinton. The Japanese gameshow is as much an example of cultural similarity as it is of difference, but it’s the latter that British TV producers choose to emphasise.“To attract viewers, it’s understandable,” says Chiho Aikman, of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation in London, “but the reality of Japanese culture is quite different.” She suggests architecture, regional cuisine (“We don’t just eat sushi!”) and the spread of hate speech as topics that don’t get enough attention. Instead, shows about hikikomori (modern-day hermits) and 40-year-old virgins with huge hentai (mangaanime porn) collections give the impression that subcultures typify an entire nation. In truth, such selections often say more about the audience than they do about the subject. So, if anyone comes out of this looking like socially inadequate, culturally insular, sex-obsessed pervs, well, it’s not the Japanese, is it?Queer Eye: We’re in Japan! is available from Friday 1 November on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8f21a61bf81d2bce4b80bb9fec0682274d3fe91/0_139_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41527da6e188b8dd043f8eaf2253967c","title":"the great british bake off final review even paul hollywood couldnt bear it","story":"It was a tearful and disaster-laden final – the natural endpoint for the series that curdled our ultimate comfort TVSpoiler alert: this review reveals the winner of the Great British Bake Off 2019. Do not read on if you have not watched the final.It was the twice-baked Stilton souffles that started the decline. Failing to rise to the occasion, and collapsing in a soggy heap, was Steph’s fate – the soufflés did the same. Going into the final of The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4), she – the four-time star baker – was the one to beat. Watching the prize slip from her floured hands, crestfallen under her fringe, was heartbreaking to watch. Even Paul Hollywood couldn’t bear it. “It doesn’t matter, alright?” he said, comforting her after the only thing her showstopper stopped was her Bake Off-winning dreams. Of course it doesn’t matter. But it also sort of does: this is the Great British Bake Off, cultural institution, a pick-me-up for troubled times, comfort food for the nation.Except this hasn’t been my favourite Bake Off year – a splash of vinegar has been added to the recipe. It wasn’t thrillingly dramatic to watch Steph come undone, it was uncomfortable, and the natural endpoint of a show that has become overly technical and stressful. Joy has not been liberally sprinkled, at least not since the jolly goth Helena – she of the octopus custard pie – was thrown out in a mean double eviction in week five. The judges’ comments have become more withering, and the skits between presenters Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig more forced (please, no more jokes about the diminutive Toksvig hiding in a sack). The showstopper this week suddenly seemed well chosen: the bakers had to create food that, deceptively, looked like something else. I fear the show may be going the same way – all the pastel-coloured, crème pat-making elements are there on the outside, but inside there’s a hint of curdling.The three bakers left – David, Alice and Steph – did deserve their places. David is so trim, I suspect he never eats the cake he makes. Neither, by all appearances, does his partner Nik. Having got to know the bakers over the past nine weeks, there is something really touching about seeing snippets of their home lives. Steph’s mum hints at a tough time for her. There are videos of Alice baking as a child. Her parents, Jane and Henry, say they have always taught her the value of “good management”. It is advice more suited to an appraisal than child-rearing, but I am going to remember it.The first challenge is – thankfully, simply – a chocolate cake. David does a good mirror glaze but – has he learned nothing during his time in the tent? – his Armagnac flavour is too much. Alice’s looks a mess. “Maybe it will taste nice?” she says uncertainly. Steph’s black forest gateau is “a very nice cake”, even though Prue Leith says it is “very 70s”, as if this is a bad thing.There is a surreal moment when Paul and Prue pretend to freeze and fail to leave the tent before the start of the technical challenge. It is deeply weird, but also quite funny. The bakers have to make six stilton souffles their faces drop. Toksvig is astonished at Alice’s limited life experience: “You’ve never made a roux?” she asks, incredulous. Steph is struggling – she doesn’t know a bain-marie needs hot water and her souffles are a puddle. The tears start, and then don’t really stop: “I just feel a bit stupid,” she says. “It’s like eating a sauce,” says Prue.Then it is showstopper day but – disaster! – Alice’s parents may not make it, as their flight from Dublin has been cancelled. More tears: “I couldn’t imagine it without them.” (She doesn’t, however, mutter anything about “good management.”)They have to make a “picnic” of baked treats made to look like something else, using airbrushing and paintbrushes. David is making wedges of lemon pound cake that look like cheese, Alice is doing a carrot cake “pork pie” and Steph is making a lemon poppyseed cake in the shape of a chicken burger, but the cake has stuck to the tin. Her macarons are not going well, either. “I don’t know how I can get through it.” What little confidence she had before has now deserted her. Alice’s creation is “exceptional” but David’s cheeseboard collection is not only that but “stunning”, too. He is the worthy winner. There is always something redeeming about the triumph of the underdog – and his little bread rolls, made to look like peaches, were amazing.I hope the producers manage to find the warmth again. Nothing big, just a recipe tweak – and a plea, too, to drop the cringeworthy “Hollywood handshake”. I wouldn’t dump Bake Off in the bin just yet – this is no ruined baked alaska moment. Maybe, like poor Steph, it’s just having an off day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f490214248099b3d114ce9ad1f029085583c8d21/0_496_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e672de5a6641bcb322662401fadbd69","title":"the great british bake off 2019 final live","story":"Steph, David and Alice battled it out for the win.

The owner of the only store in town keeps irregular hours, and in his absence leaves a container with coins and wrinkled bills on the counter. Residents take what they need and make their own change.The tiny island community in Canada’s easternmost province, Newfoundland and Labrador, is home to 54 year-round residents, and more in the summertime.Most families have been here for generations, subsisting on the once-booming fishing industry.But on 31 December, electricity and water will be switched off and ferry service discontinued. Little Bay Islands is the latest isolated village to agree to resettle on the mainland as part of the province’s community relocation policy, which offers government compensation to people who leave remote areas.Newfoundland and Labrador faces one of the most acute struggles in the country: a rapidly ageing population, spread over a vast area.Ted Grimes has lived all of his 70-odd years on Little Bay Islands. His parents and grandparents did too. But in early 2019, he – and everyone else – voted to resettle the community: he didn’t want to be abandoned along with the island. “I don’t really want to leave, no. But I had no other choice,” said Grimes in a reluctant phone interview.Instead, he will use his government cheque to resettle in a cottage in the town of Lewisporte (population 3,400), leaving behind a lifetime’s worth of mementos on the island. “The sentimental stuff, you take. Some of the stuff the kids and the grandkids gave us, you can’t throw it out,” said Grimes. “It’s gut-wrenching.”The town’s decline began in earnest in 1992 with the cod moratorium. To manage dwindling Atlantic cod stocks, the federal government plunged 30,000-plus people across the province into unemployment overnight.Little Bay Islands stuck it out longer than most by switching to snow crabs, but that industry eventually closed down too, back in 2009. Soon, only elderly people remained. The store shuttered, as did the school in 2018 after two consecutive years with no students. By New Year’s Day, Mike and Georgina Parsons – and their dog – will be the only permanent residents of Little Bay Islands. At 53 and 44 respectively, they are the island’s youngest full-time residents.They moved to the community a few years back, attracted to the idea of living off the grid in Mike’s hometown, and have spent the last couple of years preparing for a life of solitude on the edge of the Atlantic.As winter draws near residents have been slowly filing out, each weekend bringing more farewells. At least half the numbers in the phone directory have been disconnected. Many residents intend to return to their homes in the summers, but for others this may be goodbye.When everyone is gone, he and Georgina will rely on solar panels, a freshwater well, stockpiled food, a satellite connection and other off-grid features to live their secluded life on the edge of the Atlantic. There will be a few weeks each winter where Arctic ice chokes the bay, making it impossible to cross over to the mainland. Then, they will be completely cut off, left alone to witness the town’s fiery sunrises and the dead silence of starry winter nights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03dfdd9c4f422ef04e885d7203eab23a24831e0d/47_349_4769_2862/master/4769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4303173e722daef2061ee407904af82b","title":"paris urban shepherd photo essay","story":"Julie-Lou Dubreuil has been a shepherd for three years in Paris and its suburbs, and founded the Clinamen collective in the city. The photographer Abdulmonam Eassa spotted her flock in the French capital and went to her village to meet herJulie-Lou Dubreuil, 47, is of French origin and works as a shepherd in Paris and its suburbs. She joined a group of urban shepherds and then moved to the suburbs and founded the Clinamen collective.“We go to the border of Paris twice a month, to graze in the course. On a daily basis, the herd grazes an immense 400-hectare park in La Courneuve. And five days a month, they eat in the city on circuits of 9-15km, in an urban area north of Paris that extends from Aubervilliers to Garges-lès-Gonesse.”Dubreuil studied architectural engineering, as her father did, in her hometown of Bordeaux, but she did not finish her studies because of their difficult financial situation at the time. Dubreuil got a job as a field manager, building and renovating homes, and was the only woman in that line of work where she was living.“All our trips are under the control of the authorities. The goal is gradually to make room for the animal – whether wild or domestic – in the urban space.”She said she was not willing to continue with the field manager role after a few difficult experiences and had dreamed of finding something better.The idea of being a shepherd came to her mind while she was watching a herd of sheep. Dubreuil said she felt like she was facing a closed door and the sheep were telling her to open it.Dubreuil humbly describes her six years of being a shepherd, saying: “It was the sheep who taught me how to be a shepherd.” Those willing to learn must keep their eyes open “for the signs the animals communicate to you”.She added: “Many women are very shy, and I tell people there are thousands of women who are working in every sector, but they do not appreciate our capabilities as women. As always. I thought to myself, ‘Paris would appear quite pretty with sheep’.“Once, I was sad when I passed by an area under a bridge in Paris where migrants had set up camp. Usually, the sight of sheep in the streets brings a smile to people I pass by, but it did not happen with them. I thought happiness could at least pass momentarily through their minds when they see the sheep, but unfortunately it didn’t happen. I was very sad after, I kept wondering what life on this Earth did to them.”Dubreuil continued: “Generally, people are happy and especially children, because for most of them, it’s their first time in life to see real sheep. We occasionally pass by a group of snobbish people, who look down on us. However, I feel quite comfortable with my sheep in such fancy places – that is my little revenge against capitalism.”She comes to the city twice a month with her herd, and spends the rest of the time in her village in the countryside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f16213d3ad8ab7933504dad012b2adb52ba45382/0_43_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=784b291ee013bb6435d1306f875d6417","title":"world leaders return davos in desert year after khashoggi boycott","story":"Jair Bolsonaro, Jared Kushner and David Cameron among attendees at Saudi summitPresidents, prime ministers and business leaders have been arriving in Saudi Arabia for “Davos in the desert”, a year after the global elite boycotted the kingdom’s investment summit following the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, India’s Narendra Modi, King Abdullah II of Jordan and four African leaders are among 6,000 people from 30 countries attending the three-day summit in Riyadh hosted by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner is among a large US contingent including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the energy secretary, Rick Perry.David Cameron is due to speak on a panel alongside fellow former prime ministers François Fillon of France, Matteo Renzi of Italy and Kevin Rudd of Australia.Several business leaders who pulled out of the 2018 summit at the last minute because of public pressure are returning this year.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe .All three lanes of the upgraded M7 motorway in Co Kildare are expected to be in operation with a 120kmh speed limit before Christmas, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has said.Lanes are currently operating at a reduced speed limit of 80kmh from junction eight Johnstown ato the M7M9 interchange at junction 11.TII said the M7 remains an “active construction site” as works on the interchanges are completed and therefore a reduced speed limit is necessary.“We anticipate all three lanes will be in operation at the 120kmh speed limit by the first or second week of December,” a TII spokesman said.Construction began on widening a 13.5km stretch of the road in January of last year. It was originally anticipated by the contractors SIAC and Colas that all three lanes would be in operation in both directions by last April.Since early August, the three lanes have been operating in both directions at a reduced 80kmh speed limit.GoSafe speed detection vans were deployed to the route last November to ensure motorists were complying with the reduced speed limits. The latest figures from TII show 14,500 speeding fines have been handed out along the road since the works began.Local District Court Judge Desmond Zaidan and the Courts Service have both raised concerns over how to deal with the increase in cases arising from the speed checks.The M7 is used by some 78,000 vehicles per day.The upgrade project also involved the replacement and relocation of the existing ramps at Junction 10 Naas South Newhall to the main Naas Newbridge dual carriageway, the construction of a new interchange at Osberstown and a new Sallins bypass."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4065932.1572386724!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer what the uk election and the extension mean for brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson during an election debate in the House of Commons. Photograph: Jessica TaylorEPAUK parliament handoutSo Brexit won’t happen on October 31st after all?It won’t. Despite all Boris Johnson’s “do or die” talk, the UK government applied for an extension and it was granted. The process was completed on Tuesday, the EU confirmed. So the new deadline is January 31st, 2020. For Ireland, the key immediate point is that the threat of a no-deal crash-out at the end of October has been avoided. This would have had huge economic costs for Ireland and would have forced the Government to put some checks at or near the Border.And a no-deal Brexit is off the table?Not completely. If the UK does not pass the withdrawal agreement by the end of January, then the threat would reappear. So a lot will depend on the forthcoming UK election, which will now happen on December 12th. If Boris Johnson returns with a majority he could get the deal quickly passed. A hung parliament, split between different views of what should happen on Brexit, would raise questions.The Irish Government will hope to get clarity soon after a UK election that the deal will pass, finally getting no-deal off the table and locking in the terms of the withdrawal agreement . Sources here say that the language from the Conservatives – now concentrating on getting the deal through – is already different from the previous no-deal threats. That said, if the agreement isn’t through the Commons by the end of January, the EU’s reaction is uncertain and would depend on the circumstances. It also remains to be seen if the next prime minister will seek any changes from the EU before the deal is voted on again by parliament. The EU side’s position is that the agreement is now closed, though it did say that before, too. Could Brexit happen earlier than January 31st?Yes. If Johnson wins the election and gets the withdrawal agreement voted through parliament quickly, then under the agreement reached with the EU, the UK could leave on January 1st, 2020. The other option under the EU offer was to leave on December 1st, but that won’t happen now. Johnson has agreed with that Commons will not vote on it again before the election. If the UK leaves with a deal, then it is largely immaterial to Ireland whether this happens on December 31st or January 31st, as the UK would enter a transition period during which not much would change in practical terms. This would last until the end of 2020, at least.That doesn’t sound like very long?It isn’t. The Conservatives have argued that a new trade deal could be completed by the end of 2020 with the EU. Trade experts says this is impossible – and generally such deals take years to negotiate. The transition period can be extended, by one year or two, to give more time An issue in the election campaign will be how this should be dealt with by the UK, to avoid another deadline and more drama at the end of 2020.For Ireland this is important. Were the UK to leave at the end of the transition period without a trade deal, then World Trade Organisation tariffs would be likely to come into play, seriously affecting trade between Britain and Ireland and threatening jobs in the food sector in particular and other sectors reliant on the UK market and pushing up the prices of UK imports here. This impact would be similar for British- Irish trade as a “no-deal” Brexit – leaving without a withdrawal agreement. But with the current withdrawal agreement in place the issues relating to the Border would not come into play in this version of a hard Brexit. Under the new agreement, the necessary checks would take place at ports as goods cross from Britain to the North. A lot has still to be worked out about how this would operate and doing this by the end of next year looks very difficult, too. Could the withdrawal agreement be re-opened ( again) after the election?The EU says no. Firmly. The Irish Government will agree, just wanting to get it done. But who knows? Whether the new UK prime minister would want to do so will depend. Johson may just run with the negotiated deal,knowing it gives him options in future. Jeremy Corbyn, were he to win, would certainly want to reopen parts of the deal and aim for a closer future relationship.Labour would then probably put the outcome to a referendum. But whatever way the politics of this play out, a huge issue for Ireland will be the future shape of Brexit, to be fought over in the election.The indications are that Johnson will campaign for a harder form of Brexit, while Labour would support remaining in the customs union and a closer ongoing relationship. Worker’s rights after Brexit will be a major area of election debate. The Liberal Democrats will seek a second referendum and campaign for remain.For Ireland, it is as it has always been – the harder the Brexit, the worse for us. And the kind of hard Brexit envisaged by Johnson does raise the risk of significant barriers to trade with the UK in the long-term and a noticeable economic cost for Ireland. A “ Breixteer” parliament would make this more likely. And the more the UK erges from the EU, the greater the problem in managing the special arrangement for Northern Ireland, both practically and politically. A closer future trade relationship would limit the economic damage significantly – both to the UK and Ireland – and lessen the challenge of the special arrangements in the latest version of the withdrawal deal. Of course a second referendum and a “remain” outcome would be the ideal outcome for Ireland, but the Government’s recent view has been that this appears unlikely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorUK Parliament handout \u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has promised that Labour will conduct an\u0026nbsp“ambitious, radical campaign for real change” ahead of December’s general election. Speaking at the start of a debate to authorise an election on December 12th, Mr Corbyn said the European Union’s confirmation of a three-month delay to Brexit meant his party could support an early election.“I’m ready for it, we’re ready for it. Because we want to be able to say to the people of this country, there is an alternative to austerity, there is an alternative to inequality, there is an alternative to sweetheart trade deals with Donald Trump, there is an alternative of a government that invests in all parts of the country, a government that’s determined to end injustice in our society, and a government that’s determined to give our young people a sense of hope in our society rather than the prospect of indebtedness and insecure employment in the future, which is sadly all the Conservative government and their coalition with the Lib Dems ever brought them,” he said.ScrutiniseA number of Labour MPs spoke out against an early election, however, with North Durham’s Kevan Jones saying parliament should instead seek to overcome the impasse over Brexit and scrutinise prime minister Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill.While MPs were debating the early election Bill, the government threatened to withdraw it if amendments calling for EU citizens or 16- and 17-year-olds to be allowed to vote in the election. Deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle did not select any such amendments and MPs rejected the only amendment they voted on, which would have changed the date of the election from December 12th to December 9th, by 315 votes to 295.Parliament must be dissolved 25 working days ahead of the election, so this parliament will end just after midnight next Tuesday night. The government’s business managers are confident that this timetable will give them enough time to complete the passage of the early election Bill and to pass a Northern Ireland budget Bill to maintain funding for the civil service in the North.CompensateIndependent unionist Sylvia Hermon and Labour’s Kate Hoey called on the government to provide time to pass legislation to compensate the victims in Northern Ireland of appalling historical institutional abuse, which has already started in the House of Lords.The government on Tuesday restored the Conservative whip to 10 of the 21 MPs who were expelled for supporting legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.

Photograph by HOPRUAFP Getty Images)MPs in the House of Commons have voted for a UK general election to be held on December 12th.The vote, on the Early Parliamentary General Election Bill, proposed by prime minister Boris Johnson, was carried by 438 to 20 on Tuesday night.Earlier, MPs voted by 315 to 295 to reject a Labour amendment for the proposed polling day to be moved to December 9th — three days earlier than ministers wanted. The vote effectively clears the way for parliament to be dissolved on November 6th, paving the way for an election on December 12th.Addressing Tory MPs afterwards at Westminster, Mr Johnson said that he was prepared for a “tough” election fight in the weeks ahead. “I think it’s time for the country to come together, get Brexit done and go forward,” he said.“It’ll be a tough election and we are going to do the best we can.”The opposition parties had wanted to bring forward polling day to cut off any possibility Mr Johnson could make a fresh attempt to ram through his Brexit deal before Parliament is dissolved.Mr Johnson earlier argued that a “new and revitalised” parliament was needed to take Britain out of the European Union as he introduced the legislation.He accused MPs of trying to delay Brexit “forever” in a combative speech after Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would back a general election.He took aim at Mr Corbyn’s previous opposition to having an election, and claimed Labour was not interested in delivering Brexit.“All they want to do is procrastinate,” he told the Commons. “They don’t want to deliver Brexit on October 31st, on November 31st (sic), even on January 31st.”Mr Johnson said an election was needed because delaying Brexit is “seriously damaging to the national interest”, while a fresh parliament would have a “new mandate to deliver on the will of the people and get Brexit done”.He put forward the short Bill, which sets aside the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA), after previous attempts to have MPs approve an election were stymied by the fact that the act demands a majority of two-thirds of MPs to support holding an election.‘Off the table’However, Mr Corbyn told his shadow cabinet he would back an early election now that a no-deal Brexit was “off the table”. His announcement came after Mr Johnson formally accepted a Brexit extension, definitively breaking his “do or die” commitment to leave the EU by October 31st.In a post on Twitter, European Council president Donald Tusk, who is due to be succeeded in the role in the coming days, said: “To my British friends, the EU27 has formally adopted the extension. It may be the last one. Please make the best use of this time. I also want to say goodbye to you as my mission here is coming to an end. I will keep my fingers crossed for you.”Ten MPs who were expelled from the Conservative Party last month after rebelling over Brexit have had the whip restored. Senior figures including Sir Nicholas Soames and Alistair Burt were among those who have been readmitted to the parliamentary party following a meeting with the prime minister.Twenty-one MPs were kicked out of the party last month after they backed a plan to take control of the Commons timetable to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit. Former ministers Caroline Nokes, Greg Clark, Ed Vaizey, Margot James, Richard Benyon, Stephen Hammond, Steve Brine and Richard Harrington have also had the whip restored.Former Tory chancellors Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, along with former justice secretary David Gauke, are among those not to have had the whip restored. Sir Oliver Letwin, Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve, Rory Stewart, Guto Bebb, Anne Milton and Antoinette Sandbach also remain as independents.Meanwhile Owen Smith, the Labour MP for Pontypridd and shadow secretary for Northern Ireland, has said he will not stand at the coming general election. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: ReutersA December general election now looks all but certain, after Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would be prepared to support Boris Johnson’s latest effort to trigger an early poll.What is the UK government proposing?The prime minister wants an election on Thursday December 12th, with a possible compromise date of December 11th. He originally proposed December 12th, which would have allowed a few more days for MPs to debate his withdrawal agreement bill, and tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.That plan failed to win the backing of the required two-thirds of MPs in the House of Commons on Monday night, with Labour abstaining, but Mr Johnson immediately announced he would table a one-line bill, again calling for a December 12th election.This would require a simple majority to pass, and echoes a plan put forward by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party at the weekend, though they preferred a December 9th date.What will Labour do?Corbyn’s party has agonised about whether to support a pre-Christmas poll. The Labour leader has been keen to hit the campaign trail, but some members of the shadow cabinet were very reluctant.Some had hoped a second referendum could have been secured first, while others would have liked to see Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal debated and agreed, to allow Labour to focus on domestic policies during a campaign.But Mr Corbyn eventually prevailed and Labour will now back a December election.Why the row about the date?Students may have broken up for university by December 12th and it could be harder to get this cohort to vote if they are travelling between two locations. Mr Corbyn brought this point up with Mr Johnson over the dispatch box on Monday night and was heckled by Conservative MPs.Daylight hours are reduced and in Scotland it is dark at 4pm, or earlier on some of the islands. Some MPs say they are reluctant to go out campaigning in the cold and dark.Why didn’t Mr Johnson press ahead with trying to get his Brexit bill passed?The Conservatives say they do not want MPs to try to amend it and risk the bill being stuck in endless parliamentary gridlock.Some of Mr Johnson’s advisers, particularly those who are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, have been pressing for an early poll, hoping they can capitalise on the prime minister’s success in securing a deal with the EU and Labour’s discomfort about its Brexit stance.Why do some parties prefer a December 9th poll?The Liberal Democrats and the SNP proposed an election on Monday December 9th to ensure the government had no time to bring its Brexit deal back. They have also warned about the risk of students being disenfranchised.The Liberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna said the party was not prepared to accept December 12th. “If you have the 12th, it presents an opportunity for the government to get their withdrawal agreement bill through. The reason the 9th is preferable is because it would stop them from bringing forward their withdrawal bill and completing its passage through the Commons,” he said.Why does the government object to December 9th?The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the date was not realistic as 25 working days were needed between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. Parliament would have to be dissolved on Friday, while also securing royal assent for the election bill, and passing a Northern Irish budget bill, which could be very difficult to achieve.Which date will win out? Will there be a compromise?The SNP and Liberal Democrats were warmer on December 10th or 11th than December 12th. Labour has suggested it is likely to back efforts to amend the date, but the party is unlikely to withdraw support from the government’s election bill as a result.Labour sources said the party had made a decision in principle to support a December poll. –"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4065114.1572288331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pete buttigieg young democratic candidate defying categorisation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana,  talks to supporters  in Rock Hill, South Carolina on Sunday. Photograph: Sean RayfordGetty ImagesDressed impeccably in a crisp white shirt and perfectly knotted tie, Pete Buttigieg jumps nimbly onto the makeshift outdoor stage in Rock Hill, South Carolina.Close to 1,000 people have gathered to hear the mayor of South Bend, Indiana who has emerged as one of the most talked-about candidates in the Democratic race for president. In a crowded Democratic field, he has managed to stand out from the pack, his personal story and distinctive political stance evading categorisation.At 37 he is the youngest candidate running for president. If elected, he would also be America’s first openly gay president. He married his partner, Chasten, an elementary school teacher, last year.But, in addition to his liberal credentials, the young mayor has attributes that typically appeal to conservatives.After working for McKinsey, he joined the Navy Reserve. He later took a leave of absence as mayor of South Bend when he was deployed to Afghanistan. He is also a practicing Christian, and one of the few Democratic candidates to talk openly about their faith.Born and raised in Indiana, Mayor Pete – as he is colloquially known – is in tune with the American midwest. However, his homely, hometown instincts can sometimes mask a formidable intellect: he studied at Harvard before winning a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, and is fluent in several languages.This idiosyncratic blend of midwestern liberalism has resonated since he announced his candidacy in January.Polls place him at the top of the so-called second-tier candidates in the crowded Democratic field, behind frontrunners Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, but ahead of party stalwarts like senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar.Polling extremely wellWorryingly for his rivals, he is polling extremely well in Iowa, the first state in the nation to select a Democratic candidate. A RealClearPolitics poll for Iowa puts him at 15.8 per cent, just behind Biden and Warren. He has opened more offices in Iowa than any other candidate.Mayor Pete’s steady rise has been bolstered by a formidable fundraising machine. He raised $24.8 million in the second quarter of this year, more than any of his rivals, and $19.1 million in the third quarter – an impressive fundraising haul for a candidate who has never held national or statewide office.Here at Rock Hill, supporters have been queuing for hours to hear from the Indiana mayor.26-year-old Charles Deloach was first in line, queuing for more than three hours. He is a true Buttigieg supporter.\u0026nbsp“I believe that this is the best person to lead the country in the direction it needs to go. His resume is impressive – Harvard, Oxford, all those languages – but he is also a good person who is honest and can speak to people who don’t necessarily agree with him.\u0026nbsp One of the biggest problems facing the country right now is the ision between people, so it’s important.”He references the fact that Buttigieg is one of the few Democrats to have agreed to an interview with Fox News – a decision that he believes shows his willingness to engage with all Americans.Others are waiting to learn more about a candidate who lacks the national profile of figures like Biden, Warren or Sanders. John and Russ have travelled from Greensboro, North Carolina. “I like what I’ve seen so far in the debates, particularly his views on healthcare,” says John. Russ also believes that he could be a good alternative to Joe Biden. “I have a lot of respect for Mr Biden,” he says, “but still . . .” he trails off.Political pragmatistAs he takes to the stage, Buttigieg instantly connects with the crowd. His message is subtle but well-crafted: that he is a political pragmatist who can connect with Americans of all persuasion. \u0026nbsp“The sun is going to come up over a country that is going to be even more ided, even more torn up over politics than we are right now,” he says of next year’s election. “Leadership is going to matter more than ever. I’m running to be the president that can pick up the pieces and bring this country back together,” he adds, to cheers.Throughout his 20-minute stump speech and question-and-answer session, Buttigieg brandishes his credentials as a political centrist, the culmination of an ideological journey that has seen him track closer to the centre in recent months.Neither Elizabeth Warren nor Joe Biden are mentioned, but he jabs at his main rivals nonetheless. On Medicare for All, Elizabeth Warren’s bold plan to abolish private health insurance, he says his policy is “medicare for all who want it”, vowing not to force any one to give up their health insurance.Similarly, he brushes off questions about his age, a veiled reference to 76-year-old Joe Biden, pointing to young leaders such as French president Emmanuel Macron and Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand, and arguing that all successful Democratic presidential candidates in recent history were perceived as outside shots who ultimately won the White House.But while Buttigieg is a hero to the true believers gathered here in Rock Hill holding “Boot Edge Edge” and “South Carolina for Pete” signs, he is also facing formidable challenges.Clear problemButtigieg’s poor polling among African-Americans is a clear problem for his candidacy. Among the 1000 or so people who have gathered for his rally in Rock Hill, only a handful are African-Americans – in a state where the majority of Democratic voters are black.In the AME Zion church in downtown Rock Hill, a five-minute drive from his downtown rally, the atmosphere is very different as the congregation prepares for its Sunday service and annual conference. Buttigieg’s appearance at the church is one of several black outreach events on the mayor’s schedule during this three-day campaign trip to South Carolina as he tries to tap into the African-American vote.As the congregation prepares for their service, most of the worshippers say they have never heard of the young mayor. One person they have heard of, however, is Joe Biden. Flyers with “Joe 2020 – our best days still lie ahead” adorn a table in the church foyer. Biden has campaigned here several times, and the members of this church still remember him.“Pete who?” asks Margaret Holley, from nearby Fall Mill, as she gathers with choir members outside the church door. “Joe Biden’s my man,” she says, as she extols the virtues of a man who she says has done so much for senior Americans and people from her community.As Mayor Pete enters the church, bible in hand, he joins the procession entering the church. In his address to the congregation he sets out his experience as a mayor, and talks to some of the problems facing the black community – poor maternal health records, gun crime, addiction – eliciting applause. He also makes oblique reference to what may be a problem for his candidacy among some church-going African-American denominations: his sexuality. Focus group research commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested that some black voters in South Carolina may be uncomfortable with a gay man as president.Deep faith“I know what it is to find acceptance where you least expect it,” he tells the congregation, as he highlights his own deep faith. “God has been good to me.”Biden’s outreach in states such as South Carolina may pay off down the line, if Buttigieg emerges successfully from the Iowa and New Hampshire caucuses. In the meantime his campaign is ensuring that he visits as many corners of America as possible. Buttigieg even has a word for Irish-American voters, taking some time to speak to The  during his weekend whistle-stop tour through South Carolina. As the mayor of South Bend, where the historically Irish-American University of Notre Dame is located, he is well aware of the power of Irish-America.“I’ve a soft spot for Ireland and obviously the whole city of South Bend, the University of Notre Dame does too,” he says with a smile. “We’ve been honoured in the past to host the Taoiseach in South Bend on the campus and it’s a really important and fruitful relationship,” he adds, noting that, with Brexit, it is “all the more important for us to make sure that our relationship with Ireland is strong”With that he is off to his next campaign stop – a three-day bus tour across northern Iowa next week – as Mayor Pete pledges to convince Democratic voters that he can become the man to lead America."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Ten rebels back in fold, boosting Tory ranks for electionJeremy Corbyn takes Labour into election despite fears the party stands to lose seats \u0026#39up and down the country\u0026#39Brexit latest news: UK will have a Dec 12 election as MPs act to end Parliamentary \u0026#39stasis\u0026#39Hold fire chief to account, says father of Grenfell victim Comment: This should have been Boris’s worst week, but now it’s Labour facing calamityThe Great British Bake Off 2019 final, recap: A rollercoaster of meltdowns, family dramas and shock resultsLib Dems bid for up to 200 seats as it seeks to be leading party for Remain votersScottish Tory MPs claim Nicola Sturgeon leaflets will boost their voters\u0026#39 turnout in winter electionComment: How Boris Johnson can win a majority in the messiest, most important election of modern times\tFind out how your MP voted as Boris Johnson secures 12 December poll in fourth general election bidProsecutors criticised over \u0026#39serious failings\u0026#39 as father and son accused of racially abusing Premier League footballer walk free after case collapses Comment: The British public\u0026#39s chance to drain the swamp has finally arrivedWhen is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? Donald Tusk warns Brexit extension could be the last as he says goodbye to his \u0026#39British friends\u0026#39Essex lorry deaths: Two Northern Irish brothers wanted on suspicion of manslaughterComment: Suddenly, Jeremy Corbyn wanted an election after all... and Labour MPs looked more miserable than everComment: There are better arguments for raising the voting age than lowering itBristol will ban all diesel vehicles from city under new proposalGovernment troops and separatists begin joint withdrawal in eastern Ukraine townFemale MPs sign open letter to Meghan criticising \u0026#39outdated, colonial undertones\u0026#39 of media coverageElon Musk to face trial in December over \u0026#39pedo guy\u0026#39 slur aimed at British cave rescuerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000129779535_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqxb5dtL_ELTE6B8DtWJJotCrQYo3SkySopgii1ZeDLdo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"netflix faces backlash speed watch tv trial time poor viewers","story":"Judd Apatow, pictured at a Netflix event, said directors would not tolerate changes to contentArts and Entertainment EditorFancy watching a two hour film but only have 90 minutes to spare? Netflix has the answer.The US streaming service is trialling a feature in which users can watch programmes or films at up to 1.5 times the normal speed.It is being tested for mobile phones and tablets, favouring those who want to squeeze a show into their commute. Those who would like to binge-watch a box set but worry that they don’t have enough hours in the day might find it a tempting proposition.Shows can also be slowed down to half the intended speed for anyone struggling to keep up with the dialogue, or who wish to watch a scene in slow-motion.Netflix said it was responding to customer demand. But the trial has provoked an angry backlash from Hollywood film-makers including Judd Apatow, Peter Ramsey, Peyton Reed and Brad Bird.Some Netflix subscribers said they approved of the idea, as the speeded-up function would allow them to skip the “boring” parts and the slower speed would help those who struggle with hearing.The speeds - 0.5x, 0.75x, 1.25x or 1.5x - are being trialled on Android devices. Netflix said the service automatically corrects the pitch, meaning speeded-up dialogue does not result in squeaky voices.She said: “We regularly test new features that could help improve Netflix. In the last month, we’ve started testing several additional player controls, including… the speed at which you watch on mobile.“It’s a feature that has long been available on DVD players - and has been frequently requested by our members. For example, people looking to rewatch their favourite scene or wanting to go slower because it’s a foreign language title.“We’ve been sensitive to creator concerns and haven’t included bigger screens, in particular TVs, in this test. We’ve also automatically corrected the pitch in the audio at faster and slower speeds.“In addition, members must choose to vary the speed each time they watch something new - versus Netflix maintaining their settings based on their last choice.“We have no plans to roll any of these tests out in the short term. And whether we introduce these features for everyone at some point will depend on the feedback we receive.”Ten rebels back in fold, boosting Tory ranks for electionJeremy Corbyn takes Labour into election despite fears the party stands to lose seats \u0026#39up and down the country\u0026#39Brexit latest news: UK will have a Dec 12 election as MPs act to end Parliamentary \u0026#39stasis\u0026#39Hold fire chief to account, says father of Grenfell victim Comment: This should have been Boris’s worst week, but now it’s Labour facing calamityThe Great British Bake Off 2019 final, recap: A rollercoaster of meltdowns, family dramas and shock resultsLib Dems bid for up to 200 seats as it seeks to be leading party for Remain votersScottish Tory MPs claim Nicola Sturgeon leaflets will boost their voters\u0026#39 turnout in winter electionComment: How Boris Johnson can win a majority in the messiest, most important election of modern times\tFind out how your MP voted as Boris Johnson secures 12 December poll in fourth general election bidProsecutors criticised over \u0026#39serious failings\u0026#39 as father and son accused of racially abusing Premier League footballer walk free after case collapses Comment: The British public\u0026#39s chance to drain the swamp has finally arrivedWhen is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? Donald Tusk warns Brexit extension could be the last as he says goodbye to his \u0026#39British friends\u0026#39Essex lorry deaths: Two Northern Irish brothers wanted on suspicion of manslaughterComment: Suddenly, Jeremy Corbyn wanted an election after all... and Labour MPs looked more miserable than everComment: There are better arguments for raising the voting age than lowering itBristol will ban all diesel vehicles from city under new proposalGovernment troops and separatists begin joint withdrawal in eastern Ukraine townFemale MPs sign open letter to Meghan criticising \u0026#39outdated, colonial undertones\u0026#39 of media coverageElon Musk to face trial in December over \u0026#39pedo guy\u0026#39 slur aimed at British cave rescuerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000211593158_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"waitrose could do much better vegan tours","story":"Why not lead us gently to the cheese counter, asks William SitwellWhy can’t we get a tour for our special dietary needs?

Although tales of AirPods falling out of ears were few – simply mislaying the tiny gadget was much more common – the new design feels comfortingly safe.The new AirPods are also water- and sweat-resistant. That doesn’t mean they can survive being submerged and you definitely shouldn’t swim in them. The Ingress Protection rating is IPX4 which means “Protected against water sprayed from all directions – limited ingress permitted”. In other words, great for working out or suitable for wearing in the rain.One big new part of the design is the silicone ear tip, meant to be the first way to create strong audio by ensuring there’s a decent seal to keep the outside world out and the music in.Typically, Apple has included its own way of ensuring the perfect fit. Three sets of silicone ear tips are included in the box. The medium ear tip is in place. Once you’ve put the AirPods Pro into your ears, the Ear Tip Fit Test on the iPhone awaits: music is played and the inward-facing microphone can tell if there’s a decent seal or not.If it decides there isn’t, the test advises you to adjust the AirPod or try a new ear tip. Apple has devised a clever system that keeps the silicone tips solidly in place while still making them easy to swap.The tight seal means the audio quality is already better than on previous AirPods but the big new feature on AirPods Pro is also audio-related: active noise cancellation.I’ve been trying this feature more or less continuously and I might as well tell you now, it’s fantastic.As with other active noise cancellation features, it works by using a microphone that listens to the world outside and creating a noise which is reversed in phase to cancel out the external noise.Some other in-ear headphones have this, such as the upcoming Huawei Freebuds 3 and the widely-and-justly applauded Sony WF-1000XM3.Apple’s noise cancellation is very skilfully done, and highly effective. Turning on noise cancellation in a crowded room is almost like watching a movie dream sequence where the voices of people around you smoothly but swiftly fade away.In some headphones, noise cancellation can affect the audio quality of the music you’re playing. I haven’t found that to be the case here.With regular AirPods, and these too, removing one bud from your ear pauses the music, and putting it back starts it up again. It’s the natural way to respond if someone comes to speak to you.That feature is here, too, but there’s also another way to hear the outside world. It’s called Transparency Mode and it means the music still plays but you can hear your voice and that of the person you’re talking to. In other words, it overcomes the noise-isolating seal to make your voice sound as it would if you weren’t wearing headphones.AirPods Pro will scan your ears to tell you if they fit correctlyBattery life on AirPods Pro is the same as on the previous version, that is five hours. Unless you have either noise-cancellation or Transparency turned on, which reduces the charge to four hours 30 minutes. There’s another 19 hours of charge in the case, again as before.Oh, and by the way, although this is a Pro model, it doesn’t mean there’s a USB-C connector on the charging case. Like previous AirPods and like the current iPhone 11 Pro, the AirPods Pro use a Lightning connector.What is different from previous AirPods is the cable that’s supplied - here it’s a Lightning to USB-C cable, not USB-A as previously.Because of the silicone ear tips, the mechanism for changing tracks used on previous AirPods – a vigorous tap on the AirPod stem – isn’t quite so comfortable.So, the stem on the AirPod Pro has a flat capacitive touch panel, called a force sensor which, when you press and hold it, switches between Noise-Cancelling and Transparency mode.\u0026nbsp I found the easiest way to activate this was to squeeze the AirPod stem from both sides.A shorter touch is used to pause tracks or answer calls, repeated touches change to next or previous songs. It’s a different interaction but easy to get used to.Although the new AirPods Pro buds are slightly heavier than before, they don’t feel it and the bigger case is still highly pocketable and light.The audio quality isn’t the only element with AirPods Pro, though it’s obviously the most important. When you pair any pair of wireless headphones with an iPhone, the set-up and usage is important. To pair the AirPods Pro you simply open the case next to your iPhone and it’s done. It makes using AirPods a seamless experience.AirPods Pro are more expensive than regular AirPods which cost £159, or £199 if you opt for the model with a wireless-chargeable case. So, there’s a £50 premium for AirPods Pro which cost £249. This is a higher price than rival noise-cancelling in-ears from Sony and Huawei.Is it worth the money? I’d say yes, just for the jaw-droppingly good audio you get with noise-cancelling turned on. Add in the smooth user experience, the excellent, comfortable fit and the cute design, and AirPods Pro become a compelling prospect.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action.

When you look at our data, you can see part of the problem is more of things being sold that are high sugar.And therefore things that potentially affect the volume of sales are the most important.England\u0027s former chief medical officer professor Dame Sally Davies said she would support calls to ban the broadcasting of adverts for foods with high fat and sugar content.She told the committee: Some (companies) are reducing (sugar content) but through marketing, more is being bought.\u0026nbspUnless the industry knows we are going to take action at the fiscal level, they are not going to move.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it has prompted intense anger from actors and directors, who argue that the change could ruin the watching experience.Actor Aaron Paul suggested the feature would mean Netflix completely taking control of everyone else’s art and destroying it. Judd Apatow said that he would call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this and that the company should leave things as they were intended to be seen.The outcry led Netflix to publish a blog post in which it defended the update and made clear that there was no plan to roll out the feature in the short term.This last test has generated a fair amount of feedback –\u0026nbspboth for and against, wrote Keela Robison, vice president for product at Netflix. Given the questions being raised, I wanted to share more details about what’s happening.Created with Sketch.Best comedy shows on Netflix Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again. New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

We’ve been sensitive to creator concerns and haven’t included bigger screens, in particular TVs, in this test, she wrote in the blog post.Every film and TV show coming to Netflix in NovemberShe also mentioned that the feature has long been available on\u0026nbspDVD\u0026nbspplayers - and has been frequently requested by our members. She pointed to examples such as people looking to watch a scene again, or go slower because they are watching in a foreign language.As well as those changes, Netflix stressed that the feature corrects the pitch in the audio. And users must select the different speed each time they watch, rather than being able to change the speed across all of their content.The feature will not roll out in the short term, Ms Robison wrote. And whether we introduce these features for everyone at some point will depend on the feedback we receive.While few TV and film streaming services offer the ability to speed up or slow down – though YouTube has long had the option – a number of other apps do include the feature. Podcast players in particular usually give users the ability to change the playback speed, a decision that occasionally prompts criticism from producers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was rightA no-deal Brexit is a life and death situation for meMore than 400,000 people sign letter demanding fresh Brexit referendumNo vote was taken at Tuesday morning’s meeting, where Mr Corbyn told colleagues that Labour was now able to back an election, as its condition that a no-deal Brexit must be off the table had been met.Flanked by frontbench colleagues as he announced the decision to the media, the Labour leader appeared to acknowledge that there had been ision within his party over the issue.“The Labour Party loves a debate, but they also love the end of the debate,” said Mr Corbyn. “This is the end of the debate and we are going out there to win.”One shadow cabinet source made clear there had been ided opinions in the meeting, telling The Independent: “Shadow cabinet is a place where there is always discussion, but collective responsibility reigns and people are united in going for an election.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Corbyn and his inner circle, including advisers Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy, have long backed a general election ahead of any referendum on Brexit, arguing that Labour should take office and negotiate its own “credible” EU withdrawal deal before putting it to the people.But he faced growing pressure from senior colleagues, including deputy leader Tom Watson, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry to prioritise a Final Say vote ahead of a general election. In recent weeks, even close Corbyn ally John McDonnell indicated he was ready to consider the referendum-first option.In a key change of stance, Mr Corbyn resisted repeated efforts by the prime minister to trigger an election under fixed-term parliaments legislation, arguing that it should not go ahead so long as no-deal Brexit remained a risk.He stuck by this position as late as the shadow cabinet meeting on Monday, when a Halloween crash-out was taken off the table by the EU’s offer to delay Brexit to 31 January.But last\u0026nbspweekend’s decision by Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party to back a one-line bill for a December poll shifted the political calculations.Knowing that their support could deliver the election Mr Johnson wanted, Labour risked being isolated as the one major party holding out against a vote for the public, vulnerable to inevitable taunts from Tories that it was frightened of their verdict.Mr Corbyn told Tuesday’s meeting that Labour’s condition had now been met and the party would “launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen”.There was immediate dissent from within Labour ranks, with veteran MP Barry Sheerman even predicting frontbench resignations.Mr Sheerman said it was “sheer madness to hold a general election in December and on Boris Johnson’s agenda”.And he added: “A clear majority of our shadow cabinet were against a December election yesterday but Jeremy Corbyn has been persuaded to override them after interventions from Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy.”Paul Farrelly told the Commons that he would vote against an early election, as he did not believe no-deal Brexit had been taken off the table.Although supporting his party’s decision, mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested a new referendum was still the most important next step in the Brexit process.“But if there is to be a general election first, then those whose future is most affected must be given a say – including 16- and 17-year-olds and EU citizens living in the UK,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When the nation voted on whether or not to leave the EU, it was boiled down to the simplest possible question and answer: Yes or No.So the die was cast and we voted to split with the EU. But that’s the thing about orce.Between the time you say you want one, and the time you actually get your decree nisi there is a whole lot of pain as the time is filled with blame, retribution and name-calling.Because of the lack of clarity from the vote on what it meant to leave, no one thought about the most important aspects, the red lines, of how Britain should leave the EU.It didn’t need a clairvoyant to predict that lots of those dferent Brexit visions would be fundamentally incompatible.We can’t stay in the customs union and have complete control of immigration.We can’t have no hard border on the island of Ireland the Good Friday Agreement and also leave the single market. I could go on.The point is that the nation answered Yes or No to something that — it turns out — our politicians have decided to interpret in multiple ways.And that has been the fundamental problem.Because MPs have been unable to compromise in order to find a deal that pleases them enough for it to be passed. And the public despair.Politics only s effectively when a party has a clear majority to get their legislation through government. And this one doesn’t.It’s no surprise that neither party has a clear majority while they are being led by the more extreme and dogmatic elements.I was in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on Wednesday and the contrast in atmosphere between the two is stark.Politicians in the Commons don’t listen or pay each other any respect.And the amount of average front bench MPs on both sides is shameful. No wonder we have stalemate.There is an unbridgeable gulf between Leavers and Remainers, and an inability among politicians to compromise.We’ve either got to leave with No Deal or we have to revoke Article  altogether.There is nothing in between, no room for compromise or pragmatism. As a result, we are paralysed. So the answer has to be to have a general election.Usually it’s politicians who tell us what to do for the good of the country, but now we need to tell the politicians what to do.Because only with a majority government can we put an end to the Brexit misery.Although who relishes the prospect of voting on a dark December night  Least of all Jeremy Corbyn, the only Opposition leader in history who has refused the offer of an election more than once.It’s no wonder when you look at the polls. He’s unelectable, but still using his position to block Brexit and stop us from getting on with it.Until there is an election we remain in this terrible limbo. I voted Remain but, like most people, now I just want it over with.Politicians must stop using Brexit for their own political aims.If they don’t soon come up with a solution, the risk is that people are increasingly likely to vote for extreme options in a bid to make it stop.And that is a scary prospect.WHEN it comes to le choices I am a big believer in the live and let live school of thought.Andpeople choose to have cosmetic surgery because it makes them feel better, that’s their choice.But in the latest photos of Lauren Goodger her flawless complexion and insanely pillowy pout are so extreme I didn’t realise it was her.Which, to me, raises the question of why anyone would want to render themselves completely unrecogniseable IT is ironic that one of the most important causes of our time – climate change – is being eclipsed by the behaviour of the very people professing to be addressing the issue.Following last week’s debacle with the protestor on the Tube at Canning Town, this week a jobless Extinction Rebellion protester who spray-painted a war memorial has been ordered by a judge to pay £ as punishment for “senseless vandalism”.The volunteer tree-planter, Joseph O’Malley, wrote the word “mother” on the ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall last November, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.And protestors who act like this wonder why we have no sympathy for them.Meanwhile, this year’s ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests have so far cost the taxpayer £million, it emerged this week.Sure, their argument would be that the cost to the taxpayer will ultimately be a lot more than thatwe do nothing about climate change.But these tactics and statistics make me seethe with anger.I, like most of us, have to go to work so people like O’Malley can choose instead to spend their time damaging a memorial dedicated to heroes who sacriced their lives so that, ironically, yobs like him can enjoy freedom.In my view a fine is not enough. His benefits should be stopped and he should be jailed for such a disgraceful and disrespectful act.Make no mistake, stopping climate change is essential for all of our futures.But these tactics are not only distracting and damaging to that cause they are actively counter productive.But put together with another story this week showing that the number of children aged between eight and  with anorexia has doubled , it is a good reminder that we should all keep an eye on our children’s phone use.ANYONE  catch Nigella Lawson’s ultimately down to earth confession that she followed up an evening of fine dining at Noble Rot, a snazzy award-winning restaurant in London, by eating a bag of pickled onion Monster Munch in bed.You’ve got to love the fact that after eating oysters, black pudding and venison Nigella has a Monster Munch nightcap.I am fully supportive. It’s just that, well, in bed  I can think only of the crumbs.SO sorry to hear about Amanda Holden’s bad luck breaking her leg on holiday at half-term.Buther cloud has a silver lining it is surely the fact that there are not that many people who could manage to look quite so glamorous with a leg that’s broken in two places.THIS week it was announced that jail sentences for terrorists will be increased.The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.Under the moves, the “starting point” for judges when jailing someone for “encouragement of terrorism” will double to ten years in the worst cases.But isn’t there something wrong with the fact that laws to delay Brexit get passed in hours, yet laws like this take months GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the voters will not forget this treachery.EX-POLICING minister Sir Mike Penning’s discovery that he could easily obtain lethal knives online using  data is shocking.As he said, this wasn’t so much a loophole in the law but a “giant chasm”.Home Secretary Priti Patel must stem the flood of such weapons, while Amazon should face severe penaltiesit has failed to police its online adverts.Knives are fuelling a spate of murders of our young people. We must do everything possible to protect the next generation.THE England rugby team’s magnicent victory over the All Blacks was simply stunning.Their grit, ambition and fair play should set an example to our politicians.We wish Wales well in their vital clash today against the mighty Springboks.What better way to unite the nation than to see an all-UK World Cup final on Saturday SPEAKING of good news, no matter how gloomy you are feeling about the Brexit stalemate and the dismal weather, you can always look forward to Thursday.Let’s hope that whoever gets the job understands better than Mr Bercow that the Speaker should work for the country.Not try to run it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By denying us a vote on his deal HE is now the one blocking Brexit.The  Labour manesto on which I was re-elected was clear: “Labour accepts the referendum result”.It promised we would “seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain”.I repeated these words countless times in my constituency, a former mining area of Nottinghamshire that suffered under Conservative governments.I told them Labour would respect the  per cent of them who voted to leave, but that we would never stop fighting for a Brexit that brought them closer to prosperity not further away from it.This could be our last chance to keep that promise. That is why I voted with the Government on Tuesday.I did so not because I like Boris Johnson’s deal, but because I don’t like it and I want the chance to change it.This version of Brexit is flawed. It weakens workplace rights, consumer rights and environmental protections.It doesn’t include a customs union, which would be good for workers and businesses.This is not about supporting the Tories and their miserable agenda. It is about my role as an MP in opposition.I agree with John McDonnell, who said earlier this week: “By amending the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . . . MPs have an opportunity to reject the  choice between Boris Johnson’s bad deal and No Deal, and instead support an agreement that works for everyone.”I have signed Tory MP Ken Clarke’s amendment to stay in the customs union, safeguarding our economy and the many businesses that would sufferwe leave it. I want to make sure that working people are protected.I want to ensure that Brexit doesn’t give the Tories a chance to attack workers’ rights, as they have been doing for a decade.If we can’t get those changes, I won’t vote for the Bill at the final stage. In , I launched Labour’s Remain campaign alongside Jeremy Corbyn.I travelled the country making the case for the EU as the best way to guarantee workers rights, economic stability and environmental protections, among other things.But we lost that campaign. AndI stand for anything, I stand for respecting the voices and interests of working class people, who overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU.Some  per cent of those who voted to leave say that politicians don’t listen to people like them. It is these people I came into politics to give a voice to.I can’t ignore them on the major issue of our time. I know Labour colleagues who voted against the Government this week are also deeply committed to those voters.These decisions are not easy for any of us. There is an appetite for compromise in the country which is not reflected in Parliament.Earlier this year, I invited both passionate Leavers and Remainers in my constituency to meet. The debate was lively, but there was none of the shouting and jeering we see in Parliament.The majority of Remainers said they were willing to respect the result and Leavers still wanted to leave — but with a deal, not without one.If voters can compromise, why can’t politicians  I didn’t come into Parliament to protest, but to deal with the world as it is, and make it a bit better.However I can, I want to tell my constituents that I did everything I could to get the Brexit nearly  per cent of them voted for, while protecting jobs and rights in the process.Shortly after the referendum I was at a bus stop in my constituency. I was chatting to a woman and the conversation turned to Brexit. Having voting to leave the EU, she asked: “Do you think it will actually happen ”I didn’t hesitate to say, “Of course! We are a democracy and that’s how people voted.” I never thought that three-and-a-half years later we would still be arguing.If Boris Johnson really wants to deliver Brexit he has to do the one thing he’s so far failed to do — and that’s compromise. This General Election will be about so much more than Brexit.It is a chance for us to create a country where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many and not the privileged few and I will be giving my all to bring that about.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal. He has a deal.It’s Jo Swinson, her SNP cronies and the Labour Party who want to scupper that deal. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And soon, his poisonous ideology may be stamped out for good.IN a simpering interview yesterday, Justin Welby made a dig at Boris Johnson for “pouring petrol” on the isions of our country.Not for the first time, the interfering Archbishop has got it all wrong.It is not the Prime Minister who has torn Britain apart, but a small group of Remainers refusing to honour that vital principle underpinning democracy: losers’ consent.It was them and their MPs who instigated all this and who now — via their deranged campaign for a “people’s vote” — are blocking all progress on the Prime Minister’s pragmatic and sensible deal.The Remoaner Archbishop is part of the problem.Time he stopped meddling in politics and got back to his dwindling flock.IT is appalling that John Bercow — who steps down later this week — has been allowed to get away without being investigated over grave allegations of bullying.There is a new rule allowing investigations into grievance claims by ex staff, but oh so conveniently, it comes too late for the current Speaker.Shocking though it should be, this establishment stitch up is no surprise.Labour MPs happily propped up weaselling Bercow when he was inventing precedents willy-nilly to aid their Remoaner cause.ButMPs think that voters haven’t noticed what’s been going on, they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.An election is round the corner, and our useless MPs are in for a rude awakening.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

MPs were, however, debating and vote on Labouraposs amendment that would change the proposed date of the election from December  to December . Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle took the decision on the advice of Commons clerks. It is thought both were ruled out of scope for the Early Parliamentary General Election Bill - which only had a very narrow remit.    Labour prefer the earlier date for a number of reasons - chiefly that it wouldnapost allow time for Boris Johnson to try and bounce Parliament into voting for his Brexit bill before it dissolves for the election.

The Labour leader also said all -year-olds should have the right to vote, a call echoed by the SNP which also supports extending the franchise to include EU nationals living in the UK.But amendments which would have lowered the voting age and allowed EU nationals to vote were not selected by Deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle ahead of this eveningaposs vote. Proposals emerged from the opposition benches as they indicated their support for a snap election before Christmas, although any amendments approved by MPs are expected to derail the legislation required to trigger it. Speaking as MPs considered the Governmentaposs Early Parliamentary General Election, Mr Corbyn told the Commons: Labour backs a general election because we want this country to be rid of this reckless and destructive Conservative Government. It is time for real change. And Iaposve said consistently when no deal is off the table we will back an election. Today, after much denial and much bluster by the Prime Minister, that deal is officially off the table. So this country can vote for the Government that it deserves.    Asked about the public holiday proposal, Mr Corbyn replied: I agree that a public holiday on election day would actually be a very good idea because it does mean that everyone could then get along to vote without the problems of being at work at that time. It is something that has been discussed before. He added: All -year-olds should have the right to vote because it seems to me fundamental to our democracy.

The SNPaposs Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the SNP welcomes the opportunity of an election which will allow Scotland to determine its own future.    He said: We on these benches are simply not prepared to sit back and allow Scotland to be taken out of the European Union against its will. So on that basis, Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity of an election, because make no mistake, the election thataposs coming is going to be the right of Scotland to determine its own future.

Labour swung behind Boris Johnsonaposs bid for a general election in December - the first one since .Whoever wins will steer Britainaposs policy on leaving the EU for years to come, and their first days in office will be crucial deciding what happens next. Boris Johnson and Labour have radically dferent approaches. So what will happen to Brexiteither of them get into power  Hereaposs a basic explanation.  Nope. Well not exactly.Thedealis still active and agreed between the UK, the EU and  European leaders - so it can be taken up by whoever gets into  Downing Street, Labour or Tory. But theBillthat puts it into law will be parked until after an election, when itaposd have to be brought back to the UK Parliament from scratch. Itaposll be easy to bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill back and pass itBoris Johnson wins a majority.If he doesnapost get a majority itaposs a dferent story. So the PM is gambling it all on winning the house.  Boris Johnson would have achieved his goal of clearing opposition to his Brexit plan. He could bring back his Withdrawal Agreement Bill and, this time, get it through the House of Commons without it being whittled down by angry MPs. No doubt he would still face opposition, buthe had an overall majority - of MPs buoyed by an election victory - heaposd likely be able to get it through the Commons before the January  deadline. There could still be a hold-up when the Bill got to the Lords, and the European Parliament, which both need to raty it. But the path would be easier. If he still faced opposition, Mr Johnson has not ruled out leaving with no deal at the end of January.  Labour has vowed to try to negotiate its own, softer Brexit deal - one that protects workersapos rights, has alignment with the single market and puts the UK in a customs union with Brussels.You could expect to see Jeremy Corbyn going to Brussels in a bid to reopen talks with EU chiefs.Brussels leaders have previously been reluctant to do this, but a change of leadership in the UK would be a clear incentive to reopen negotiations. Whatever Labour come up with, that would then be put back to the people in a confirmatory second referendum. Itaposs likely people would be asked to choose between Remain and the Labour deal. Labour would only decide how to campaign in that referendum at some point in  at a special conference. All this would almost certainly require another delay to Brexit. What happensthe Lib Dems get a majorityThis would be unprecedented but... theyaposve said theyaposd revoke Article  . The Lib Dems also back a second referendum. We know you hate to hear it, but... probably more of the same. How Brexit unfolds will be defined by what groupings can be formed between Remainers - including small parties like the Lib Dems, who are widely expected to make gains - and Brexiteers. Expect more running battles, attempts by backbenchers to delay Brexit, or a surprising majority around one thing or the other. A hung Parliament could boost calls for a second referendum, because some would see it as the only way out now an election has been exhausted. But whether enough MPs would back it for it to actually happen, through a vote in Parliament, is a totally dferent matter. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs and is now on ice. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workersapos rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

Hamza Ul Haq, , Loic Nengese, , and a -year-old boy allegedly murdered Joseph William-Torres, , in the belief he was Samuel Hunter. Mr Torres was blasted at point-blank range in the chest on March , . Jurors at the Old Bailey heard the man was ambushed by three men associated with an east London gang known as the of the Mali crew. The attack, which lasted  seconds in Walthamstow, northeast London, killed Mr Torres. It is said the three men were intent on a revenge attack after Ul Haq had been squirted with acid and his friend was stabbed by masked youths in a Subway shop some months previously.  They had, it would appear, mistakenly identied him for another: Samuel Hunter. Samuel Hunter is a male of the same height, same build, similar facial features, who even possessed and wore the same beanie hat as Joseph William Torres, who lived locally and often socialised in Essex Close with and where members of Priory Court used to meet, Alison Hunter, QC, prosecuting, said. Ul Haq, of Manor Park, east London, Nengese of Walthamstow, and the youth from Upper Clapton, all deny murder. But the court heard the attack was planned. Ms Hunter continued: It was undoubtedly a ruthless and planned attack on a rival group member, but he was not the intended target. The explanation perhaps lies in the fact that this shooting was not an isolated incident - rather it took place in the context of what can be characterised as a series of related and retaliatory acts of violence that had at its roots, a dispute between rival groups of youths.

PCSO Emma Turner and PCSO Fin Moore, from Shipston Police Safer Neighbourhood Team, said: Yesterday around .pm in Brailes a resident reported hearing a thud in her front garden on closer inspection she discovered what appeared to be a small part from an aircraft. We attended and Aviation and relevant Authorities were informed.Its a part from a US B Bomber from Fairford Glos. They have been in contact. It is unclear which part of the plane it has come from, but it believed it could be part of the engine cowling, which covers and cools the engine during take-off and landing. Web users reacted to the bizarre incident on social media and said it was a miracle nobody was hurt and no property was damaged. Ian Bright said: Considering what could have fallen off a B, think they got away lightly. Mel Harris added: That is extremely dangerous.

He rang the Ibiza Rocks Hotel and discovered that no bookings had been made.

But his widow Anne Heard, of Ottery St Mary in Devon, told coroner Andrew Cox that she did not want his sympathy concerning her late husband.She then walked out of the inquest into his death while declaring “I will take this matter further,” according to Devon Live.The inquest in Truro, where Devon coroner Mr Cox is now overseeing cases, heard today that Mr Heard, a fit and active man, had elective surgery on a hernia at Heavitree Hospital in Exeter on July , .His blood pressure at the time of the operation was well within the safe limit and was checked before, during and after the procedure.All risks associated with the routine operation were described to Mr Heard, although not any risk of death which was believed to be too small. He was reassured and happy to proceed.    The procedure went smoothly and the anaesthetist was happy that nothing occurred which could have played a part in his stroke the next day. The inquest heard that Mr Heard was keen tohome and sleep in his own bed. In the early morning of the next day he was found collapsed downstairs in his home. He was admitted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital suffering from a stroke. It was decided that in his best interests he should be transferred to Derrord Hospital in Plymouth where a thrombectomy would be performed to retrieve a clot from his brain. Unfortunately, the procedure was not successful and the operation was terminated. Over the next few days he was no longer able to respond with his eyes or verbally, and his braindeteriorated. He died on July . Mr Cox read a statement from Mr Heard’s son Daniel which questioned whether the hernia operation caused or contributed to the clot which killed his father. Consultant Mr Ivaylo Tzvetkov said that only one in , patients suffer such a complication following a hernia operation. He believed the timing was a coincidence and felt the surgery did not play a part in the clot developing. Pathologist Dr David Hilton was unable to saythe procedure was a factor, but in  years’ experience as a consultant he had never seen a previous case where a hernia operation had caused a stroke. However, he did say that the timing was suspicious.

The -year-old told the Sydney Morning Herald how she had been filmed without her consent by flirtatious customers.

In the end she started wearing a tag with a fake name on it in the hope that the overreaching customer would be dettered.   An anonymous respondent to the Australian Human Rights Commission survey on sexual harassment said: Wearing a badge with our name on it makes customers and sexual predators feel comfortable enough to harass us under the guise of friendliness.It also allows them to think that because they know your name they are entitled to other personal information about you and to touch you. Wearing a name badge also makes it incredibly easy for those same predators to go home and look us up online and then harass us from the comfort of their homes.” The research found that % of , retail, fast food and warehouse workers surveyed in Australia had experienced some kind of sexual harassment in the past five years. Another woman spoke of a man slow moving closer to her as she worked in a restaurant. “My harasser sits outside my work in the food court and watches me as I work, she said.

His game time amounted to just seven games for United.The cutting also revealed that, earlier that year, Dundee wanted to sign Williamson from Aberdeen while trying to offload Robinson to Hearts.Robinson, who had one cap for Scotland, refused that move, so the move for Williamson at that time stalled as the Dens Parkers were planning on using the fee from Hearts to fund the move.Footnote – I use the word ‘Footnote’ as at the bottom of the aforementioned cutting it was titled thus.It had nothing to do with the above-mentioned players but informed readers that a young Dundee United player, Alan Boath, had left Tannadice and moved to Forfar Athletic.I relay this tale simply because Alan has been very supportive of this column and has contributed on a few occasions.Alan emigrated to New Zealand not long after and enjoyed a long and great career over there.He represented NZ in the  World Cup in Spain, where one of his opponents was Scotland."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/medw-party-in-pink-zumba-6.jpg ","title":"dancers party in pink for charity at dundee international sports centre","story":"A #Party in Pink# dance event has taken place for charity.The annual Zumbathon for breast cancer charities took place at Dundee International Sports Centre.Also at the event was Aimi Munro, a Boobette with cancer charity CoppaFeel.Aimi shared some of her story and let people know what CoppaFeel is all about. vw, px\"  She said: “For me, being part of Coppafeel for five years has been like therapy.“Being a Boobette and being able to share my story and possibly encourage and empower even just one person to check their boobs is amazing.“I’m grateful to be able to share the inspirational work of Coppafeel.”There are only five Boobettes in Scotland. vw, px\"  Anyone interested in joining, male or female, can apply when applications open in January.Organiser Gillian Wallace said: “The fundraiser is something that Zumba does every year.“We run Party in Pink in October to try to promote breast cancer awareness.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/19595097-940x555.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 0 dunfermline clark comes back to haunt pars as utd stay top","story":"Nicky Clark turned in a man-of-the-match display against his former team Dunfermline to help Dundee United to a vital - win and cement their place at the top of the table.The former Pars hitman teed up Lawrence Shankland for the opener on nine minutes before curling in a tremendous free-kick on  minutes to win the Tangerines all three points and keep top spot in the Championship outright.United manager Robbie Neilson made three changes from the - defeat at Queen of the South with Jamie Robson, Peter Pawlett and Clark coming in for Paul Watson, Sam Stanton and Louis Appere.Unbeaten in their last four, Dunfermline only showed one dference to their starting XI with Andy Ryan coming in for Kevin Nisbet for the Tannadice clash.And it was United who started strongest as they took the lead on nine minutes.Liam Smith#s initial delivery from the right caused Cammy Gill in the Pars goal to flap at the ball and when Clark launched it back into the box, Shankland made no mistake from six yards out to net his th United goal of the season.Two minutes later Dunfermline threatened to net a quick equaliser but Benjamin Siegrist in the home goal was a match for Ryan#s header. On  minutes, the Pars had another chance to draw level but Kyle Turner blasted over from  yards.However, it was former Par Clark who came back to haunt his old side three minutes later as the Terrors doubled their lead.After Ian Harkes was fouled on the edge of the box, Clark smashed home his first of the season with a curling right-footed free-kick from  yards out leaving Gill rooted to the spot.Paul McMullan nearly made it - on  minutes, sliding onto Smith#s low delivery at the front post, but Dunfermline managed to clear the danger.Three minutes after the restart Calum Butcher rled a full volley just over the bar from  yards after the ball broke kindly for the Englishman.Having only just ed from injury there was concern over Robson on  minutes when he went down in his own box but after receiving treatment he was OK to continue.On  minutes the Fers had their best chance of the match as Josh Edwards slid in former Terror Ryan Dow but Siegrist got down well to deny the attacker from close in.The home side bounced back, though, as Clark was denied a double by a well-timed Lee Ashcroft block in the box following Pawlett#s cutback.Second-half sub Nisbet threatened to claw one back for Stevie Crawford#s men but his volley into the ground bounced over on  minutes.On  minutes Dunfermline came even closer, this time Nisbet feeding Ryan who cracked a curling effort off the crossbar.United were able to close out the final moments, despite heavy pressure from the visitors, to snap a two-game losing streak and tighten their grip on top spot.With Ayr United losing to Dundee on Friday night and Inverness falling to Morton, the Terrors move three points clear at the Championship summit.Dundee United : SiegristSmith, Robson, Reynolds , Brown Butcher , Harkes McMullan, Pawlett , ClarkShankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Stanton, Watson.Dunfermline : GillComrie, Edwards, Martin , Ashcroft Paton, Cochrane , Turner , Dow Kiltie, Ryan.Subs not used: Scully , Beadling, Morrison, Coley.Ref: Steven Reid.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45563814-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45563814-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45563814-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45563814-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee united record 3 7m loss in last year","story":"Dundee United have posted a loss of more than £. million in the last year.An annual report for shareholders details a deficit of £,,, compared to £, for the previous year, as reported by the BBC.The  figure was reduced by £.m of sell-on fees.Salary costs, including pensions and social security contributions, also came in at £,,, % of an annual turnover of £,,.American owner Mark Ogren has allayed any fears by vowing to continue his financial backing.#The signicant loss emphasises the level of financial investment made by Mark Ogren to the club,# said a Dundee United board statement in advance of Tuesday#s AGM.#[It also] includes the costs associated with undertaking the restructuring that was required, including a complete overhaul of the first-team playing squad and coaching staff, and restructuring the academy.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street misery on tayside for dee united and saints","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Jim Masson dissect the struggles at Dundee, Dundee United and St Johnstone at present, while George offers some genius tactical advice to the managers.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"sleeping giant is ready to awaken says dundee united coach lee mcculloch","story":"Assistant boss Lee McCulloch says results like the -

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy. Thanks were extended at the after match banquet to the organisers, Lagos Strollers Walking Football Club for an excellent tournament and to all the players for their sporting attitude throughout the matches.Remember Lochgilphead walking football takes place every Tuesday at the sports centre, .-.pm.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions. Most notably, George received the MBE from Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace on December , , ‘for services to the community in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute.’Maureen Keith, daughter of the Provost, handing over a bouquet to the Queen after the presentation ceremony.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain MacWhirter  Jeremy Corbyn   s indecision is only making things worse by prolonging this Brexit purgatory","story":"IN the last two years wersquove gone from a government with a small majority, Theresa Mayrsquos, to a government with no majority, then to a minority government and finally to no government at all.At least, thatrsquos how it was looking on Friday when Number  threatened to ldquogo on strike this weekLabour continue to block a General Election.Boris Johnson has rolled back from that improbable industrial action, but he was only stating the obvious: we donrsquot have a ing government in Westminster.With a majority of minus  it is impossible for this administration to get its legislation through Parliament.People say we have a zombie parliament, but itrsquos the government that should be pushing up the daisies.For Europeans, used to proportional voting, having no government is quite normal, for periods at least.Belgium, appropriately enough since its capital is Brussels, had no government for nearly two years after an inconclusive election in . But Britainrsquos adversarial system was supposed to preclude that. Until now.Thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the government canrsquot simply call an election when it chooses, or when it loses votes in the Commons, as this one has done repeatedly. It has to win a two-thirds majority, which places the initiative in the hands of the opposition.Alternatively, a government of national unity could take over after a confidence vote, which comes to the same thing.Labour has been demanding a General Election for the past two years, but somehow canrsquot quite get round to voting for one, or moving a vote of no confidence in the government.In a very real sense, the opposition has been keeping this government on le support.Jeremy Corbyn said he wouldnrsquot vote for a General Election until a no-deal Brexit, which Boris Johnson had threatened for October , was ldquotaken off the table by the Benn Act.The Benn Act passed, the letter was sent, Brussels has signalled an extension and no deal is off the table.But Labour are now saying they want no deal to be taken off the table even after that extension. It wants an indefinite extension of Article , or a law saying that the UK will never be faced with a hard Brexit.Labourrsquos justication for these transparent delaying tactics is that ldquoyou canrsquot trust anything Boris Johnson says. Well, few might disagree.But the only way to remove this serial liar is by an election. And, short of a Labour government in perpetuity, it is not possible in a democracy to rule out no deal forever.No UK government can be bound by acts of a previous administration. The only way to rule out no deal indefinitely would be to revoke Article , or vote for the deal.Labour has always voted against revocation and, indeed, condemned Jo Swinson as ldquoNigel Faragersquos little helper when the LibDem conference voted to revoke Article  without a referendum.Hopes rose and fell last week that the Remainers might finally get their repeat referendum when the Withdrawal Bill passed Second Reading.Some hoped that they could tag a referendum amendment. But it was not to be.First, there needs to be government legislation to hold a referendum, not least because it involves expense, and Boris Johnsonrsquos government will never legislate for a referendum.Second, there is no majority in the Commons for a referendum, which is why the Peoples Vote campaign decided not to try a referendum vote on Super Saturday .Third: there is no clarity on what the question would be. Remainers want the deal versus Remain. But Leave voters would never accept that.Theyrsquoll demand that no deal must be on the ballot paperRemain is on it. Donrsquot expect the Electoral Commission or the Supreme Court to sort that one out.I suppose Brussels could simply say: well, wersquoll revoke Article  for you ndash but that might look just a little like dictatorship.They canrsquot undo Article  anyway because it was triggered by that vote in the UK Parliament in  when MPs, including Labour, voted to leave by a majority of .Thatrsquos where our problems really began.French president Emmanuel Macron has made clear that the Benn Act extension until February , the third, must be justied by a ldquodemocratic event ie a General Election or a referendum.But Brexitus Interruptus has now infected Brussels as well.Last week, the EU withheld a decision on theof the extension because they want to seeParliament votes for a General Election tomorrow.But since Westminster is waiting for a ruling from Brussels on the extension, we have found ourselves on a diplomatic equivalent of MC Escherrsquos Endless Staircase.For some reason, the UK opposition parties believed Boris Johnson when he said he would rather ldquodie in a ditch than extend Britainrsquos membership of the EU beyond October .Boris Johnson is notoriously unreliable, so why they believed this is a mystery.What ditch did they expect him to fall into  Did they expect him to have a nervous breakdown and resign Johnson did what yoursquod expect him to do, which is ignore what hersquod said and reframe the question: itrsquos not him in the ditch but Labour, for refusing to agree to the General Election.ldquoBut he said hersquod never send the letter complain Labour supporters on social media.Again, Johnson just amended the record, sent the Benn letter to Brussels along with a covering note saying itrsquos not government policy and that he wouldnrsquot co-operate.Itrsquos what this column said he would do all along.Labour are now horribly exposed because they somehow didnrsquot bargain on Johnson turning the extension against them.The opposition is now split. The SNP say there is now no justication for delaying an election because no deal is off the table ndash though Ian Blackford wants one on December , not December  as the government has offered.For his part, Johnson is offering to give Parliament time to scrutinise his Withdrawal BillLabour agree to an election. But Labour still wonrsquot bite.The truth is that Labour MPs were furious when Jeremy Corbyn hinted last week that he might go for the election he has been demanding all along.Most Labour MPs hate the Labour leader and donrsquot want an election while hersquos in charge. Plus, many realise that theyrsquoll lose their seats because theyrsquove been delaying the Brexit that many Labour voters voted for.That is certainly a problem, but it is not one as likely to arouse much sympathy from the electorate.All they see is endless delay, confusion, chaos, parliamentary bickering and a Prime Minister who got a Brexit deal that no-one said he would be able to get, jeering at Labour for not agreeing to the General Election they said theyrsquod vote for once hersquod got it.Labour MPs can console themselves that the polls are bad right now.But to depend on opinion polls for an election really would be a real constitutional innovation.Perhaps we should replace the Queen with YouGov as head of state.Then at least something might happen."},{"url":null,"title":"turnaround-town-ayr-running-names-scotlands-beautiful-high-street","story":"Hit by shop closures and a lack of investment, Ayr town centre was in the running for the  Plook on the Plinth award for the most dismal town in Scotland.But, six years on, the seaside town has turned its fortunes around and is now in the process of massive regeneration.The transformation and combined effort of locals and South Ayrshire Council has led to the town being nominated for an entirely dferent award- Scotlandrsquos Most Beautul High Street.:Network Rail pursues owner of Ayr Station Hotel over track chaosThe award, run by Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership and Keep Scotland Beautul, celebrates the best of the countryrsquos towns based on horticultural achievement, environmental responsibility, and community participation.Phil Prentice, Chief Officer of Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, said Ayr is in the running thanks to a massive amount of investment in the town.ldquoAyr is a beautul former market town with a long history.

The role of the journalist is, to put it simplistically, to inform viewers, listeners and readers of what they understand to be happening. This may not always be perfectly balanced, depending on the focus of the topic. And, indeed, I do not expect the contribution of journalists to be impartial, either, because their publications are not. So we might expect the interpretation of, say, ajournalist to a piece of breaking news on Brexit to be dferent than that of, say, ajournalist. The expectation, though, would be that a journalist would happily turn their hand to any story irrespective of whom it involved Brexiter or Remainer, Unionist or Nationalist, and so on.There is a key test, here and it is this: as a consumer of the news that they produce, I should not know how a journalist votes, whether in elections or referendums. That is the crucial dference between a journalist and a commentator. As soon as it becomes clear how they vote, they have ceased to become a journalist and bled into the commentary.:Scottish independence: Indyref will be focus of SNP election campaign says Nicola SturgeonIn this, I must say, I think that Peter Obornersquos criticism of a couple of particular journalists - the BBCrsquos Laura Kuenssberg and ITVrsquos Robert Peston - was wrong. His insinuation that they effectively swallow lies from Downing Street is off-the-mark because their job as journalists is to report what they are hearing from politicians and campaigns, whether that be Downing Street or the opposition. Both of those iniduals fit my description of journalists rather well.However, not all of their colleagues fit it, with too many having morphed into being partisan commentators. Those of us observing the media in Scotland would have been able to see this coming since . Referendums, as we all now know, are destructive things. They ide families, workplaces and society. And in the highly charged political environment they produce, the integration of journalism and commentary has gone almost unnoticed.It is now commonplace in the pages of national newspapers to see print and broadcast journalists giving us their opinion, rather than simply their analysis , in a first-person column.That journey - from journalist to commentator - is often mirrored at the other end of the spectrum as commentators morph into activists. It is here where we canto the example of Saturdayrsquos radio debate. Commentators are very commonly people who have a political history. This rather goes with the territory - anyone with enough interest in the detail of politics to qualy as a commentator has probably been around a political party in their past.There is no wrongdoing in the audience knowing what a commentatorrsquos opinions and voting patterns are, but they are entitled to expect that he or she will be able to offer a semi-detached perspective on the story. They should be able to go beyond the spin and tell the audience what sits behind it, analysing its potential effects in a thoughtful and, importantly, unemotional way.But just as there is a critical dference between a journalist and a commentator, the same dference exists between a good commentator and an activist. Emotional, blinkered, one-sided interpretations which show an inability to understand another perspective are a sign that you are consuming the views of an activist rather than a commentator. On Saturday, it was clear that Kevin and I fitted into the box of commentator, whereas Jamesis clearly an activist.I know that this might not seem important. But it is, now more than ever. This blurring of the distinction between journalists, commentators and activists goes right to the heart of public trust. Now more than ever, we are dependent on the media to help the public in the navigation of the most isive issue in our collective political memories.For me, broadcast and print media get a \"must try harder\" mark. They need to understand who they are commissioning, and why. They must decide before they pick up the phone what they want their  to be - journalism, commentary, or activism. All are legitimate, but all are dferent and should not be mixed.Modern politics is corrosive enough letrsquos not make it worse in the media.

That compares with between , and , homes per year currently.:Lanarkshire renewable energy firm advancesThe WWF research echoes work done for ScottishPower, which said that some pound billion will have to be spent by  replacing two million gas boilers with electric heat pumps.Householders, of course, would most likely be replacing their boilers in that period anyway. However, some economists believe climate pressure could mean just allowing people to replace gas boilers when they die will not achieve a fast enough switch.ScottishPower said that extra car-charging points and boilers ndash and extra capacity to power them ndash would mean investment, from all sources, of poundbn in total.WWF Scotland is suggesting state backing for a new Scottish renewable heat-pump grant to help businesses, landlords and householders switch away from gas.Robin Parker, climate and energy policy manager at WWF Scotland, said: ldquoFossil fuel heating is a major cause of climate pollution in Scotland, and itrsquos the next big frontier for reducing emissions, that we need to address properlywe are to play our full part in responding to the climate emergency.:Scottish renewable energy firms exporting to more than  countriesldquoWhile there is some scope for iniduals to ensure that their homes are not wasting heat, most of this change needs to be led by government, working with local authorities. When it comes to replacing a boiler, unlike buying a new car, the consumer is in the hands of the installer, so government financial support and regulation are the main way we can make a dference.ldquoWe have all the technological answers we need, there are already thousands of Scots enjoying warm, renewably heated homes, free from fossil fuels. Thatrsquos something we should all be able to enjoy, just as it is already the norm in many other northern European countries.

For example, heat pumps will need to be installed at a far greater rate than the current installation rate of gas boilers.ldquoWe are beyond the point of fitting in with existing replacement cycles of heating equipment, and delay will increase costs.

Lead author Dr Grace Hallinan, of Southampton University, said: ldquoThis suggests neurons with tau pathology could be rescued with a therapeutic disease modier.It highlights an under-appreciated time window for such therapeutic intervention.Her team introduced ldquomisfolded diseased versions of tau into mouse neurons growing in a dish.

To say that was a blow would be the understatement of my le.:Row over BBC Laura Kuenssberg biased anti-Sturgeon tweetFresh out of university at the time, I wasnrsquot in the least bit clued up on the  Equal Pay Act, but I knew that paying him more than me just wasnrsquot right and making that discovery was gutting. Our employers, it seemed, knew they had done wrong too: though they initially tried to dismiss my complaint on the basis that my colleague had to drive to work while I could walk, they quickly conceded that that was irrelevant and raised my pay by pound. It was hardly the stuff movies are made of, but the victory felt signicant nonetheless.And yet here we are in ,  years after a tiny victory that came  years after the Equal Pay Act was written into law, and women are still being put in the position of having to ask their employer to account for why they are being paid less than men for doing work of equal value. From council workers to news anchors, there seems to be no shortage of women for whom the law has offered no protection until they have taken action to enforce it, with BBC presenter Samira Ahmed this week becoming the latest in a long line of women forced to take a stand in the name of equality.Ms Ahmed, a freelance journalist who was formerly a reporter and presenter on Channel Four News, has for the past several years hosted a range of programmes for the BBC, including Radio rsquos daily arts show Front Row and the BBC News channelrsquos weekly points of view programme Newswatch. She has taken the broadcaster to the Central London Employment Tribunal over what it pays her to present the latter, arguing that she should get the same pound, a show that Jeremy Vine is rewarded for presenting Points of View rather than the pound an episode she has been paid since taking over the programme in .She would appear to have a point. Points of View may air on BBC One while Newswatch is available on the news channel only, but to all intents and purposes what Ms Ahmed and Mr Vine do on those programmes is broadly the same. Both are at the helm of presenter-led shows that last for  minutes, are aired once a week and offer the public the opportunity to give their views on BBC content. Sure, Jeremy Vine has to relay comments about programmes that are produced right across the BBC while Ms Ahmed handles views on news programmes only, but does that mean he deserves to be paid close to seven times as much as her for it  Does anyone really think that the situation is a fair one Well, yes, some people obviously do. Because despite being here before with former China editor Carrie Gracie - who last year was awarded yearsrsquo worth of back pay after receiving signicantly less than the men doing the same job in other parts of the world - and despite agreeing to pay Ms Ahmed more for her work on Front Row and Radio rsquos Night Waves Free Thinking - where she had been earning % and % less than her male equivalents - the broadcaster is adamant that the disparate levels of pay awarded to Mr Vine and Ms Ahmed can be justied. Their programmes, though similar, follow dferent formats, you see, with Mr Vinersquos being classed as entertainment while Ms Ahmedrsquos is seen simply as news. The fact they are shown on dferent channels has also been offered up as an excuse.:BBC lsquois facing wave of pay claim tribunalsrsquo as Ahmed case beginsThanks to the other women who have been willing to stand up and challenge the law on equal pay before her, it seems likely that Ms Ahmed could win the argument. After all, when Dumfries and Galloway Council argued in  that the salaries paid to female classroom assistants and learning support staff could not be compared to those of groundsmen and road workers it was quickly stopped in its tracks.Just because male and female employees work in dferent locations, doing dferent jobs does not mean they cannot be compared for equal-pay purposes the Supreme Courtrsquos now president Lady Hale ruled, setting a precedent that has been applied to Glasgow City Council and supermarket giant Asda in the years since. Taken in that context, the dferent-channel, dferent-format argument expected to be deployed by the BBC in the employment tribunal would seem to be more than a little bit thin.Yet proving that Ms Ahmed should be paid equally to Mr Vine evenshe can prove she works equally to him could end up being easier said than done, with employment lawyer Ross Meadows pointing out that the BBC will still have ldquoa genuine material factor defence argument in its armoury. You see while it is one thing to show that a man and woman are carrying out jobs whose value can be said to be the same, itrsquos another thing to expect them to be paid equally for them, with experience and seniority sometimes allowed to trump equality in the eyes of the law.And this is where women, despite supposedly having had the law on their side for close to  years, have been set up to fail again and again. In a working world where men continue to hold all the most senior positions, where they use those positions to hire in their image - often without ever making it known there are jobs available to compete for - women are fighting a losing battle when it comes to gaining the experience that would confer on them the seniority that gives them the right to be paid equally.Until that problem is addressed - until women are allowed to compete on the level playing field we are repeatedly told is open to us - unscrupulous bosses will always have a get-out on equal pay and the situation will continue to self-perpetuate.As she was getting ready for her tribunal hearing this week Samira Ahmed released a statement in which she noted that the back of her BBC pass is inscribed with a set of values that include showing respect for each other, celebrating ersity and taking pride in delivering quality and value for money. In light of that, she said, ldquoI just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.Regardless of what the tribunal decides, it is a question we would all benefit from knowing the answer to."},{"url":null,"title":"napping-jeremy-corbyn-entirely-right","story":"Its long been my cast iron method of dodging the worst of le to have a snooze, a little unconscious procrastinate.As long as Boris Johnson doesnt loom into ones subconscious, asleep is the best place to be.So there was Jeremy Corbyn, a man after my own heart, having a wee shut eye on the train up to Scotland. Nothing remarkable about that.After all, hasnt Jacob Rees-Mogg survived the scandal of a scornful slouch on the green benches in the House of Commons  The Right Honourable Member took up three seats with his horizontal pose, giving the appearance of waiting for Nanny to come and tuck him in.Anna Turley, the Labour MP, called Rees-Moggrsquos lounging the ldquophysical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement, disrespect and contempt for our parliament.To be fair, the Leader of the House had had a long day, having to wait out a Brexit debate, only one of the most consequential in parliamentary history.And there was Sir Desmond Swayne last year having  winks during a speech by colleague Ken Clarke in the House of Commons. Or, a wee  seconds, as Sir Desmond later claimed. \"It happened,\" he said, expressing annoyance at himself after being pictured with his head lolling on his shoulder, \"And it wont happen again.\"His excuse, he said, was a \"very long day\". It was an interesting excuse, given that one was expecting a detailed summary of how he had been up early dealing with parliamentary business. In fact, hed been up at .am for a dip in the Serpentine before work. I cant say thats much of an excuse but Im ill equipped to judge, given Ill happily nap on the floor of a public toiletthe mood takes me.Speaking after his colleague had been caught asleep on the job, fellow Tory MP Bernard Jenkins said back in the bad old days, before Commons proceedings were first televised in , MPs used to use the Chamber for a nap.\"Its only the advent of television,\" Mr Jenkins said, \"That means you cant go in to the House of Commons and have a snooze.\"Its only the advent of smartphones turning everyone and their granny into a paparazzo that allowed Corbyn to be caught using his commute to catch up on a bit of REM.What an invasion of privacy to be photographed asleep. A mid-market newspaper published the picture with apparent disgust at Mr Corbyn snoozling away as England played the All Blacks.Despite being out for the count, a Labour spokesman said \"Jeremy followed the game and is delighted England won.\"The leader of the opposition also tweeted that the game had been \"an incredible team performance and hard-fought victory\". What a let down. Honestly being the best policy here, the politician should have tweeted his congratulations and fronted up: \"Missed the game, was having a well-earned nap.\"Cant do that, though, as its more socially acceptable to be caught fibbing than to be caught napping. The clues in the phrase: \"caught\". And why Corbyn wasnt working, he was travelling. Thats what train journeys are for, a little siesta. And bus journeys. People are less relaxed about napping while driving but folk can be funny about these things.Youre \"caught\" napping because of the negative stereotypes attached to daytime sleeping, that naps are signs of weakness and sloth. Yet who do we have in the opposite corner Maggie Thatcher advertised how little sleep she needed. Donald Trump boasts of only four hours a night. Hand me my bedsocks.In Japan Jeremy Corbyn would be praised for his diligence in working himself to the point of exhaustion. Sleeping in public is a practice known as inemuri and is more acceptable than cancelling an engagement due to fatigue.You can nap anywhere - shopping mall, cafe, public transport - as long as you arent sprawled unsociably, violating more space than you need to. Take note, Rees-Mogg.Inemuri, despite being an ancient practice, is a neat melding of the modern trend of praising the desire to be constantly, performatively busy, with holding naps as king.Its been firmly established that naps are a positive step for good physical and emotional health. In the US employers such as Nike and Google have recognised the benefit of a well rested workforce for increased production. One has nap pods in its headquarters, the other has space for sleep or meditation.Its a sensible way forward. Down with the shame of snoozing. Up with refreshing rests.If we go for a December election, Labour should run on a promise of protected nap times for workers. A sleep pod in every workplace.

He has pleaded guilty and he has been appropriately punished.Mr Richards said it did not undermine trust in barristers and was not deliberate or reckless.He highlighted that Lord Keenrsquos shotgun licence was renewed by police three months after his conviction for breaching the terms of the licence.ldquoIt was a one-off lapse at the lower end of the spectrum ofoffences and was not a serious offence, he said.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmAs fire crews continue to try to extinguish a fire at a house near Binscarth, Finstown, a number of road ersions are in operation.

A Bill for the election to take place on December  finally cleared the Commons on Tuesday evening. It still has to go to the House of Lords, but it is unlikely to be held up in the upper chamber.ndash Why isan election being called Boris Johnsonrsquos minority Government is far from a majority in the Commons, and the Prime Minister is seeking to bolster his position with a snap general election which he hopes will also see off the threat on his right flank posed by Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party. -- --ndash Why have the major parties finally agreed on something The Liberal Democrats are riding high in the polls at levels rarely seen since the height of ldquoClegg-mania in  and are keen to take advantage of that surge.They have joined forces with the SNP, who also want an early general election, to push for a pre-Christmas poll.After failing on a number of occasions to force a general election under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act ndash which requires the backing of two thirds of MPs ndash Mr Johnson is opting to force through a Bill for a December political showdown that needs just a simple majority to succeed. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn--Labour initially seemed to stall on a December election, but Jeremy Corbyn appeared to recognise the parliamentary numbers were against him, and instead, insisted he relished the prospect of a national poll.ndash Will the election campaign be all about Brexit Brexit would be a big flashpoint as the major parties have much more pointed policy stances than they did in .The Tories would be pushing the amended Withdrawal Agreement Mr Johnson secured with Brussels, which all wings of the party have, grudgingly, united behind.Labour wants to renegotiate that deal and then put the results to a new referendum, and the Liberal Democrats seek to revoke Brexit without the need for a fresh national poll on the issue. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson--ndash So, what are the other issues As Theresa May found out in , it is easy to lose control of the narrative of an election campaign.Law and order is likely to figure large as, in his short tenure as premier, Mr Johnson has put his tanks on Labourrsquos lawn and matched their pledge to fund , extra police officers.The NHS and adult social care are also set to be major issues.ndash When will I know who is standing in my constituency Candidates must register to stand in a seat  working days before a general election. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --ndash What do the major parties have to fear The Brexit Party is likely to try and hammer the Tories over Mr Johnsonrsquos pledge that he would ldquorather be dead in a ditch than ask for an EU withdrawal delay beyond October .Labour stormed back from  points behind in  to come close to drawing level with the Conservatives in the popular vote, but since then Mr Corbynrsquos image has been rocked by his stance on Brexit and rows over how he has handled allegations of anti-Semitism within the party.After two very shaky general elections, the Lib Dems have a new, untested, leader in the form of Jo Swinson.ndash So will Brexit happen once wersquove had the vote  -- --Not immediately. But,the Tories secure a majority they could push through their Withdrawal Agreement Billndash House of Lords willing ndash and under the so-called ldquoflextension agreed with Brussels the UK could quit the EU on December , rather than the currently scheduled exit date of January .However, the European Parliament would also need to raty the deal before the end of December for this to happen.ndashWhattherersquos a hung parliament Such a scenario is likely to produce more deadlock.

For it is very clear that the uncertainties around both Brexit and the potential for a second independence referendum, are factors acting as a drag on Scotland’s economic performance. But that doesn’t tell the whole story.Last week the respected Fraser of Allander Institute issued an economic commentary looking at Scottish performance in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole. They pointed to evidence of the negative impact of political uncertainty: business investment in the UK having now been negative in five of the past six quarters, and both consumer confidence and risk-appetite amongst businesses being weak.A deal with the EU will, according to Fraser of Allander, help lt some of the fog of uncertainty that has hung over the Scottish and UK economies in recent times, and deliver a short-term economic boost. The impact of Brexit in the longer term will depend upon the exact terms of the future relationship with the EU.: Fraser of Allander report paints mixed picture for Scottish business: Extra income from Scots tax rises ‘wiped out by slow wage growth’If we burrow deeper into the economic commentary’s findings, we learn that there are specically Scottish concerns which cannot be attributed solely to Brexit. Scotland’s annual growth rate is now just . per cent, compared to that of the UK as a whole at . per cent. Since , the Scottish economy has grown at four per cent compared to five per cent in the UK and seven per cent in the EU. And, while some of the recent weakness in the Scottish economy can be pinned on Brexit uncertainty, the actual trend in activity since early  is broadly in line with the period between  and . So even before the EU referendum, the Scottish economy was underperforming the UK average, and that trend is simply continuing.Tens of thousands without jobsThe employment figures tell a similar story. In the three months to August, Scottish unemployment jumped . per cent, and employment fell by . per cent. This means that Scottish unemployment is higher than the UK average, and the employment rate at . per cent substantially below that of the UK at . per cent. That represents tens of thousands of adults of working age who could be making an economic contribution and paying taxes, but are not currently doing so.Whilst it may be very convenient for SNP ministers to blame all of Scotland’s economic woes on Brexit, the facts simply do not fit this narrative. There is something  going on here, above and beyond our departure from the EU.When we look at business confidence in Scotland, political uncertainty is being caused not just by doubts about the future post-Brexit, but concerns about the prospect of a second independence referendum. With no certainty as to what currency we might use post-independence, how we would fill the fiscal gap of £. billion, or what our trading relationship would be with our largest export market in the rest of the UK, it is no wonder that Nicola Sturgeon’s relentless drive for indyref is having a negative impact both on business and on consumer confidence.Financial executives filled with horrorDespite all this there are key strengths to the Scottish economy. There was a palpable sense of positivity and optimism at the Scottish Financial Enterprise annual dinner last week, with businesses across the sector showcasing dynamism, innovation and investment in skills. This is a sector where Scotland’s reputation has always been strong, and there is no sign of that changing anytime soon.For many of those I spoke to at that dinner, whilst Brexit uncertainty is a concern, it is issues closer to home that they regard as more of a threat. The prospect of an independent Scotland running a dferent currency from the UK is one which fills financial industry executives with horror, and would inevitably lead to a substantial exodus of capital, and with it thousands of well-paid jobs.The SNP’s tax regime, ensuring that anyone earning above £, pays higher taxes than the rest of the UK, is also an ongoing concern. For young ambitious, talented, highly mobile iniduals, levels of taxation are a factor in determining where they accept job offers, andwe continue to see a growing ergence between Scottish tax rates and those where in the UK then the impact on Scottish business is bound to be negative.Fraser of Allander concludes in its report that there is need for a more open discussion of the underlying growth dynamics of the Scottish economy. That is a debate that the Scottish Conservatives are up for. Our Scottish Future Growth Council has already published a suite of proposals on how to improve productivity in our economy, and will shortly be producing its second report on shting our economic performance into a higher gear. Bringing in serious measures to tackle our economic underperformance, rather than simply blaming the Brexit bogeyman, is what is going to make a real dference in the future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"when a focus group heard this fact about brexit there was horrified silence alex cole hamilton msp","story":"The public are being duped over Brexit by both the Tories and the SNP, writes Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP.Somewhere, in a windowless room of a national opinion polling organisation, the answers offered by a recent focus group uncovered a worrying reality.When asked a series of questions about Boris Johnson’s new Brexit ‘deal’ the carefully selected cross-section of the UK public demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is actually going on. The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 mps overwhelmingly back first december election in 96 years","story":"The UK is set for its first December election in  years after MPs overwhelmingly backed a snap election.Voters will go to the polls on  December, with parliament being dissolved at a minute past midnight on  November.MPs voted by  to  to back legislation calling an early election on the government’s preferred date, after a Labour amendment setting  December as polling day was defeated.After moving first to call for an election, the SNP and Liberal Democrats abstained.

Now, how about a bit of investment in tidal and hydrogen generation. The Sullom Voe four dual-fuel gas turbine generators could be updated and expanded to eight. That should easily supply power for immediate use and cut our carbon footprint in half.Let us see how the Green loonies ponder this one I have just crunched a few figures! The cost of the interconnector would pay for four Shetland power stations. Now one gas-fired would leave acool £, million for research and education. Rock on Viking Energy and goodbye.In Ian Tinkler’s mind the phrase “Green loonies” is meaningful. Can anyone  explain who his loonies are, or do they only exist in his imagination   If the phrase is only meaningful to Ian it is dficulty to see how “sanity is taking over at last”.Very appropriate for the idiots who wasted £ million SCT funds and now want to throw £ million more at windfarm Shetland. Characterising those behind Viking Energy as silly, mad or idiotic is simplistic, inaccurate and unhelpful.Some, but certainly not all, of the backersand approvers were incorrectly motivated by honestly held environmental concerns.Tom Morton’s name springs to mind.Ian Tinkler’s phrase, “Green loonies”, does nothing, however, to capture the aice that motivated some of the others who, vocally or secretly, also backed the scheme.Neither does Ian’s phrase address the  “development-at-all-costs” notion that the council must always be on a mission to find and back the next big thing.Their job should instead be to see things are fairly considered.Ian may be right to argue the inter-connector is unaffordable, that Shetland needs an intermediary gas-fired power station # possibly en-route to a publicly owned eco-grid # but he’s foolish to garble so important a message.An independent commission may be needed to look at how Shetland’s future energy needs can best be met.The council could have a role in calling for one.And Ian Tinkler can retain his self-stimulating role in calling others silly names at random for his own pleasure.As for “snowflake”, well bless his cotton socks.Would he could stick to his point.In all seriousness, I wince when I read the word ‘ loonies’ in these columns. Would it not be possible for this to cease Rather than Green Lunatics, how about, ignorant, aicious, self-serving, greedy fools. I could go on but the Big Girls Blouses of the PR brigade may be offended. That would be tough on Girly Swots.!!! Sorry for the windup folks, I do not suffer pretentious fools all that well.Side comment : I believe when Sullom Voe, was being planned, an arrangement was negotiated where SV could supply gas, via pipeline, to the power station here in Lerwick, at very little cost, thus the cost of power to the people of Shetland, becoming one,not the only, cheapest source of energy for the consumer. However, the get out clause, the Hydro-Board, asked BP could the guarantee % supply  No surprise, BP said # No. #. That being said, we, Shaetlanders# were denied a cheaper cost of energy and a cost of living. I believe. Could this arrangement still be in the pipeline as an alternative to Viking Energyin providing a cheap source of energy Well Ian, that was almost an apology laced with get # out clauses.!!Making references to the so called PR brigade and Big Girls’ Blouses does nothing to assuage people who deliver their opinions in reasonable, measured tones.To attack with great relish says a great deal more about the attacker than the attacked. One can very readily understand why so much intolerance in the world makes it an unsafe place.Being proud of such a weakness merely serves to compound the problem.With patience and a large slice of contrite thinking, things could repair and meaningful exchanges COULD take place.Roll on.Since May . The  MWe plant has four  MW General Electric Frame  gas turbines . It may be more cost-effective to modernise and expand this plant at Sullom than build a gas pipe to Lerwick. Unless I am mistaken a connecting power line is cheaper and less environmentally damaging than a pipeline. If Shetland ever gets its renewable act together this plant would act as the backup power station until a non-fosil fuel plant was established. A tidal generation would be the obvious solution with hydrogen back up and storage used for transport and energy storage.Haydn makes a worthwhile point. We shouldn’t be contributing in harmfully in ways that feed stigma around issues of mental health.People should not feel discouraged from seeking help that could be le saving. I have some sympathy with those at the Shetland Times who have to decide which of the comments offered here do not “observe normal standards of decency and tolerance”, but perhaps the style book needs updating. There is a related problem in which when we point out the problem this particular perpetrator gets double his satisfaction and then feels stimulated into issuing further offensive posts.This problem would be lessened were the Shetland Times to simply refuse to carry posts containing terms such as “loonie” and “lunatics”. I suspect the staff periodically consider such issues and wouldn’t be troubled by the prospect of being considered “Big Girls Blouses”or indeed “pretentious fools” were they to cut less slack.It is also possible to become desensitised, even to such annoyances as the distracting sound of a dentist’s excessive drill.The profit motive aside, I can’t see the subsea cable being preferable to Shetland becoming self sufficient through sustainable renewables..."},{"url":null,"title":"electrical engineer electrician at scale aq ","story":"• Experience working within aquaculture is desirable but not essential as training will be given.• Full driving licence is essential.• ScaleAQ offer a competitive salary, private healthcare and training development opportunities.ScaleAQ is the result of  years of experience and consists of Steinsvik, Aqualine and AquaOptima.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

Founded on a cross-community basis, the idea was for people to work together where they lived and beyond, focusing on local drama at affordable prices as a ersion from – and a reaction to – rising unemployment and violence.This week, close friend and fellow North Belfast playwright Martin Lynch revealed Kate’s final play, ‘Betrothed’, will be posthumously produced at the Baby Grand, Grand Opera House, on November  and  for three performances only – with two on Saturday, November .Set against the backdrop of the  Irish rebellion, Betrothed tells the tale of one of the most remarkable love stories in Irish history.Whilst the dynamic Emmet was rallying his forces to strike a blow against the English, a remarkable young woman, Sarah Curran, was anxiously waiting his safe . Having secretly agreed to marry once the rebellion was safely out of the way, the young couple’s plans were dashed when Emmet was arrested, tried and hanged, drawn and quartered.Sarah’s story takes a further unexpected turn when she chooses to marry an officer in the British army. Caught between two worlds, can she ever forget the promises of her past Martin Lynch explained: “Kate was the main writer for Tongue ‘n’ Cheek Community Theatre company and wrote many of their plays before she passed away at Christmas before last.“When we worked together at the Community Arts Forum, she would occasionally go on about a woman called Sarah Curran. Sarah was the girlfriend of Irish rebel, Robert Emmet, he of the failed  rebellion. Later, Sarah married a British army captain, Henry Sturgenor, thus beginning one of the most remarkable love triangles in Irish history.“With Betrothed, Kate last left us a great legacy. I hope all those who were active in the community theatre movement in the s and the general public too can come along to the Baby Grand and bear witness to Kate#s final play.”Betrothed will perform at the Grand Opera House on Friday, November  at .pm and Saturday, November  at pm and .pm.Tickets are priced between £. and £. and are available from the Grand Opera House box office or, alternatively online at www.goh."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mchawk eyed gulls give big macs a miss","story":"THERE’S something strange flying high above McDonald’s at Westwoods. Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pipe bomb detonated in west belfast garden","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has condemned a “reckless attack” on a house in West Belfast.A pipe bomb-type device detonated in the front garden of a house at Aitnamona Crescent around .pm on Saturday night.The occupant of the house reported hearing what they believed to be a firework going off.

Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast fancy dress fans reveal who they want to be at halloween","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was very last-minute and our other Barbie outfit didn’t work out. “We are going out three times in one week, but we are not missing any class so it’s okay.”Beth McDaniel said: “The older you get, there is pressure to do multiple Halloween looks. You can’t just do one Halloween look these days.”Ellen Watson and Beth McDanielQueen’s University students Cathal Coulter and Ronan McSherry were both buying hats, with Cathal explaining that he was “going as one of the Blues Brothers” with a friend.Courtney Smyth said: “I’m dressing up as a devil because it’s scary.”Jarod Connor, a physics student at Queen’s, reflected the growing popularity of podcasts in his choice of outfit.

It’s quite cheap.”some costumesLea Steinheimer, a teacher, and teaching assistant Phil Jones hadn’t decided on an outfit, but were browsing Elliotts to find some inspiration.Phil said: “It’s just an excuse to dress up. I work with kids and we dress up for events. I quite like horror films and things like that.”Clark Elliott is managing director of the shop. He said that while things are typically manic in the build-up to the festivities, the landscape has shted due to the growth of online sales.He said: “Online has been particularly busy. Lea Steinheimer and Phil Jones outside Elliotts“It used to be that people would come here last-minute, but people are being, I think, more organised and ordering online. “It used to be that the queues were way round the corner from maybe the third week in Halloween, but the volume of people ordering online has increased dramatically. “People like to party and students will be coming down I reckon in the next couple of days.”According to Clark, the trends for this year are specic to recent Hollywood hits.He said: “The main costumes that have been going this year have been the clowns.

And we therefore thought that the central issue in settling our post-Brexit relationship with Ireland was going to be the maintenance of the common travel area, and the mutual sustainment of rights for Irish people and British people in one another’s territories, and the sort of core of the identity problem that the Good Friday Agreement had attempted to solve.“I think I probably – to only criticise myself – was slower, I hope weeks rather than months, to come to the realisation that actually the people side of this, while not being complacent about any of it, was, as a bureaucrat, an easier problem to see one’s way through than the movement of physical goods.”Asked about a lack of contingency planning in relation to Northern Ireland ahead of the EU referendum, Sir Olly said: “I know debate continues to rage, rightly and understandably, about whether it was the right political decision not to do contingency planning.“I do think – as I say, very personal view – you can probably overdo the extent to which a vast Whitehall process of churning out ring-binders full of papers pre-June  would somehow have meant that the British state was far, far better prepared afterwards.”Sir Olly added: “I thinkmy Cabinet Office colleagues, who were in post at the time or more generally across Whitehall – I was in the Home Office at the time –we’d been asked to produce a paper on what does the border look like after a ‘no’ vote, a ‘leave’ vote, I think we would have ended up in a position whereby we would have produced what I hope would have been a good quality piece of work, but I’m not sure anyone would have read it.”He said he will offer any support he can to those who will continue negotiating the future phases of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"general election set for december with labour ready to back pm","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Briefly describe Strathearn..pushA. Were an all-girls school that prides itself in offering a range of opportunities in terms of academic and extracurricular but underpinning everything is ensuring that their well-being is paramount.Q. What is the schools ethos A. For every pupil to reach their potential. Three years ago the girls came up with a new motto - Encourage, empower, excel.Q. Youre in your th anniversary year which you marked by planting bulbs. Tell us about that.A. The girls wanted to leave a legacy so every child from four-year-olds in Prepto my -year-old girls planted a bulb in our anniversary walkway at the front of the school. Beds were dug for every single year group, so in the springtime all of those bulbs will come out. They planted a tree too. We also decided we would have  acts of kindness.Rather than just contribute money, we asked all the girls, by inidual or class, to do an act of kindness. Weve had people out doing beach cleans, weeding gardens and a Christmas lunch for the community. Weve asked the girls to think of others rather than themselves because we do recognise that we all have good lives here.Q.

I dont have a natural catchment in east Belfast. About % of my children come from a three-mile radius but % come from beyond: Ards Peninsula, Bangor, north Belfast, Lisburn.Q. Your policy on bullying A. Zero-tolerance. We educate the girls about their behaviour and relationships and the way they should behave towards each other. Kindness is a word we use a lot at Strathearn.Read MoreMeet the Principal: Robert Robinson, Campbell CollegeMeet the Principal - Karen Quinn, of Victoria CollegeMeet the Principal: Sean Rafferty of St Louis Grammar SchoolRead MoreMeet the principal: Insts Janet WilliamsonQ. How has teaching changed over the years A. Technology is the big change. When I started I was drawing diagrams on the board in chalk. Now everything is at the flick of a switch, weve access to online videos and it has become much more visual. Every room here is equipped with an electronic whiteboard. Children are registered in the morning on computers. Gone is the letter home to parents in the schoolbag now its parentmail. Although social media gets a negative name it can work very positively because we can reach out very directly and quickly to parents. Pupils now are more aware of the world around them, and social media means theyre more exposed to dferent environments.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolQ. Do schools feel a bigger responsibility in the social media world A. Yes. Schools are the best portal for getting the message out, so all schools now have excellent pastoral care systems. We dont try to do it all in-house we bring in external expert agencies to empower the girls to be the best citizens that they can be and look after their personal welfare.Q. What pressures are there on the job nowadays A. Finance is the big one. Every school is having to manage a very tight budget. The other area is special educational needs. With no ing Assembly, its dficult to address either.Q. How aware are the pupils about Stormont A. We have a strong school council here were trying to teach them that debate and discussion is the right way forward for change. Weve just started a politics department, and were bringing in MLAs so the girls can put questions to them. So far the UUPs Mike Nesbitt has been here.Q. So youre offering politics at A-level now A. We always did - in collaboration with other east Belfast schools. Campbell College, Bloomfield Collegiate and Ashfield Girls and Boys have an agreement that we share subjects at A-level.Q. Tell us more about that.A. Campbell doesnt offer media studies I do it here. Campbell or Bloomfield offer German in alternate years so my girls and Bloomfield girls will go to Campbell to make a viable German class. I dont have moving image arts but Ashfield Boys has one of the best.Q. What about the problem in Northern Ireland of educating too many teachers A. Thats a yes and a no. In some areas, maybe. In the secondary sector there are still shortages in some areas such as sciences and business studies.Q. In  you were one of three principalswho teamed up against drugs. There was an e-safety booklet. How well did that initiative work, and have you had to reprimand any pupils for dabbling Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolA. Weve never had a drugs problem here. We have excellent girls and an excellent pastoral team who regularly keep them informed on dangers and how to keep themselves safe. We are proactive.Q. Youve taught in co-educational and same-sex schools. Whats the advantage of a girls only school A. The girls dont have any gender bias towards their subject choices. Two of my top subjects are maths and physics. They also stay focused on their studies.Q. An unwelcome advance was made to one of your pupils in Bangor as she was waiting for the bus, and theres been a well-documented incident of a teacher sending inappropriate messages to a pupil at a Belfast grammar school. Do you have special classes to teach the girls about such dangers and threats A. The girls have a weekly Learning for Le and Work tutorial programme with a form tutor and the element that deals with such matters is personal development.Q. In  a pupil, Catherine Buchanan, died from leukaemia. Another, Holly Massey, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour last year. It cant be easy coping with that A. We are a family at Strathearn and we have a strong sense of community. Last year we raised £, in one week. That showed to me what a special school this is and just how much we care about each other. When something dficult comes we really pull together.Q How important is academic success A. It opens doors and allows the girls to move forward but in this day and age it must be balanced with a skill set.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolThis year our exam results were our best ever. At GCSE .% got  A*s to C, but .% of those grades were A* A - so over  of our grades out of  were A* A. And A-levels were our best ever - .% were  A* to C but % of those were As or A*s.

European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says the deal is a “fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions”.But the DUP says it cannot support the deal in Parliament, citing a series of objections over the integrity of the union and Northern Ireland’s economy.– October  The first Saturday sitting in  years was set to see MPs hold a “meaningful vote” on the new deal and the pressure was particularly high because it was also the deadline for the PM to ask for an extension under the Benn Act.But first members were to vote on an amendment tabled by exiled Tory Sir Oliver Letwin which would effectively compel Boris Johnson to comply with the Benn Act until legislation to implement Brexit was in place and MPs approved the deal.MPs voted for the amendment  to , scuppering the PM’s plans and forcing him to take an action he repeatedly vowed never to take.

The Prime Minister even threatened to pull his entire deal and call for an early electionthey did not back both aspects.The WAB was approved in principle at its first hurdle when MPs voted  to  for it. But the blow came when they rejected the hasty timetable by  to . The PM put his plans on ice by saying he would “pause” the WAB until the EU makes a decision on granting a delay.– October  EU leaders agreed to a Brexit “flextension” until January  unless Parliament raties Boris Johnson’s deal sooner, leaving it unlikely the Prime Minister would hit his October deadline.The Prime Minister then lost his third attempt to force a general election, with MPs rejecting his plan for a poll on December  – which would have provided time to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the campaign starts. MPs voted  to  in favour of a snap election, but were short of the two-thirds majority needed.Mr Johnson was expected to make a fresh attempt to drive legislation through the Commons which would only require a simple majority.– October  Boris Johnson was on course for a pre-Christmas general election after MPs finally backed his demands to go to the country in an attempt to end the Brexit deadlock.The Commons voted by  to  at third reading to approve a one-page Bill enabling the election to be held on December . The vote effectively cleared the way for Parliament to be dissolved on November , paving the way for an election.The breakthrough came after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn bowed to intense pressure and agreed in principle to support an election. But MPs voted to reject a Labour amendment for the proposed polling day to be moved to December  – three days earlier than ministers wanted."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon claims snp general election success would confirm case for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It can charge advertisers morethey want to narrow ad delivery to people who have visited certain locations.The Australian commission began proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia alleging Google breached the law through a series of on-screen representations made as users set up Google accounts on their Android phones and tablets.Mr Sims said these on-screen representations meant Google collected, kept and used highly sensitive data about consumers’ location “without them making an informed choice”.“This is a world-first case,” he said. “This action — in relation to misrepresentations in relation to the data Google collects, keeps and uses — has never been taken before.”Google said it was reviewing the allegations.“We continue to engage with the ACCC and intend to defend this matter,” the company said in a statement.When people had their Location History turned off, they may have felt that Google was not collecting their location data and recording it and keeping it, but in fact they wereRod SimsThe AP investigation found that even with Location History turned off, Google stores user location when, for instance, the Google Maps app is opened, or when users conduct Google searches that are not related to location.Automated searches of the local weather on some Android phones also store the phone’s whereabouts.Earlier, business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby mobile phone towers evenall location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data.The Australian commission alleges that between January  and late , people setting up their Google accounts on phones and tablets would have incorrectly believed that Location History was the only setting that affected whether the company was collecting a user’s location data.“When people had their Location History turned off, they may have felt that Google was not collecting their location data and recording it and keeping it, but in fact they were,” Mr Sims said.He said the watchdog believes some of the alleged behaviour has continued. His commission will ask Google to admit the actions and promise to stop.The commission also plans to ask the court to impose penalties, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"489647","story":"BALLYRONANS brand new community garden has been unveiled following the injection of pound, of EU funds.The green area, accessible through the wood beside the marina, was unveiled last week by elected representatives.The five figure sum was injected into the area by the EU Rural Development ‘LEADER’ Programme.The work includes improved access, new gates and fencing, new kerbing and resurfacing, and the installation of seating, raised beds, planting and a chalkboard.

Therefore, John decided that any money raised would go to the same charity.Between both the coffee morning and John’s sponsored silence over pound, was raised and a few late donations have been filtering in.Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend John said of the challenge: “I didn’t speak until I came out of the school at  o’clock. It was tough enough. My wee girls were saying, ‘try not to break it’, but it was hard because I’m used to rambling on.“The principal was taunting away at me, saying ‘John, ye haven’t seen the caretaker ’ and I would shake my head, then he’d go, ‘do ye know where he is ’ and I would just shake my head again.“And someone of the kids, the primary  pupils, would say ‘gone speak to me’, so they were doing a bit of taunting too. But they couldn’t break me.”John has his sights set on another charity fundraiser after Christmas when he plans on walking from Derry to Buncrana and back again - he says Macmillan will most likely be the beneficiary again.Sadly, a number of John’s close family have had cancer and he appreciates the emotional, physical and financial support the charity offers.“They’re known as the ‘little angels’ and they do a great job. If you have somebody belonging to you suffering with cancer then they put them at ease.“The work they do is amazing,you ever have any issues you’re able to phone them and they come straight away.“I’m happy to see this money go to them because it will go towards helping more families in Derry.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Department of Education has however told this paper that a petition signed by parents and pupils at the school will be taken into account by the Permanent Secretary. Parents were “devastated’ when first informed of proposals to close the Coshquin school after a letter was sent out asking them to attend a meeting with Education Authority officials back in April. Parents and schoolchildren from Groarty P.S. then hand delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry imploring him to reconsider. googletag.cmd.push Due to uncertainty surrounding the future of the school, a number of parents have taken the dficult decision to transfer their children to another school. One such parent, Diana McLaughlin, whose son and daughter attended the school, said: We actually ended up leaving the school. The uncertainty was a bit too much for us. I didnt need the hardship of worrying about finding an appropriate school later so I moved my son to St.Patricks where we have other children in the family there. Her son, Haiden, misses Groarty IPS terribly and found the transition to a new school very dficult but is now settling in well. Mrs McLaughlin added: With transfer tests looming, we really wanted to get them settled before all that work kicked off. She paid tribute to the hard-working staff at Groarty IPS who had a great relationship with the children and persevered in trying circumstances. Over the weekend, a spokesperson for the Department of Education stated said the Department’s formal consultation period does not close until the th November. “Whilst the Education Authority’s consultation process closed in June, no decision willbe taken on the future of the school until closure of this statutory stage of the process. “The Department has received a petition from parents and pupils and this will be considered along with the Case for Change before a decision is taken by the Permanent Secretary in the continued absence of a Minister.” History The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and  – that may be less for the   school year given recent departures. The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city. The Education Authority’s consultation document made reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S. It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. The EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education. And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. Both schools previously made a joint submission under the Shared Education Campuses Programme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.” At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.

The -year old is now a free agent after the playing season ended and is considering his options, although it is still possible he could stay at the Brandywell having already had discussions on a new contract with Declan Devine.Yet with Perth also a big fan of Sloggett, it seems likely that the midfielder will have no shortage of options before he commits to playing next year.Sloggett, like his manager and team mates, was in celebratory mood after Derry City defeated Finn Harps - on Friday night to seal European football next season , an achievement which Devine described as his greatest of his managerial career.We were selling a pipedream to players in December,” he stated. “The place didnt have the most positive feel about it when we came in last November because of the season last year.“Weve been magnicent. We went to very dficult venues and performed and to see the Brandywell full again, thats definitely my biggest achievement. Lets see where we go in the future but this is a night Ill not forget for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  Change for the betterThe feeling at the Brandywell on Friday night was in stark contrast to the mood around the club at this stage just twelve months ago, after an eighth place finish in the Premier Division. So much has changed in such a short time. I didnt really think about achieving Europe to be honest, Devine continued. I wanted us to get a good start and see where we were. I wanted a team that reflects the passion of the football club and honesty and work ethic of the football club.I watched last year and teams were coming from Dublin and Cork and they were walking in here and walking back out with three points and I didnt like that. Our guys fight for the club, fight for the city and fight for their families. “Add into that theyre not only fighting but putting on a brilliant display of attacking football, scoring a lot of goals and creating a lot of chances. “The players deserve huge credit and Im just over the moon for them.It has undoubtedly been a successful season for Devine, his staff and his players, but the City boss is not content, and wants even further progress next season. We finished fourth but we want to push on and get better next year,” he insisted.It takes a lot of effort but Im very fortunate that I have Kevinand Paddyand Martyand Declan McIntrye and all the backroom team pulling in the one direction. Those guys have put their le and soul into it.Theres a lot of good people at this football club. We all share a work ethic and we all work extremely hard.Coming off the pitch there was supporters there who were eight, nine,  years of age. There were supporters who were in their s.Its a fantastic night for us but we have to strive to get better and not pat ourselves on the back too much. “Its going to be harder next year and Im sure a lot of clubs will put a lot of investment into it.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It may have taken longer than expected for Junior to get off the mark at his new club, his first goal coming against Longford in the EA Sports League Cup at the start of April, but since then he has been one of the stars in this new look Candystripes team. Junior has provided some memorable moments along the way, his hat trick at Turners Cross amongst them, not to mention scoring the most spectacular disallowed goal in Brandywell history when his unbelievable overhead kick against Finn Harps was disallowed for high feet. Still, there was little,any, talk about Junior winning the Golden Boot going into the last game of the season until an early double against Harps on Friday night left him tied with Dundalks Patrick Hoban. There was a  alarm during the games on Friday night with word coming through from Oriel Park that Hoban had sneaked back into the lead after scoring against St. Patricks Athletic, but that was quickly deemed an own goal by goalkeeper Brendan Clarke. Within minutes of that news coming through, Junior took the ball out of the sky from Jamie McDonaghs pass and fired in his third to go clear in the scoring charts, and with Hoban being substituted, the privilege was his. It was a fitting end to a memorabkle night for the forward. Before the game I wasnt really thinking about the top scorer,” he admitted. “It was about winning the game, getting into Europe and thats be a massive achievement for us. But obviously when I got two goals at the start of the game, I thought I could get another one and who knows what could happen  Thats what happened so Im very happy about that.At first I heard hehad scored one and the boys were trying to get me a goal but I thought its just not going to be. As long as we won and got into Europe I was happy but its a massive bonus and Im just happy. Its crazy.” googletag.cmd.push UnknownJunior was vehnturing into the unknown somewhat when he first arrived at Derry, but he quickly adapted, with his managers faith in him helping settle a player who was not only new to the league but to the city. I literally came here and bought into the idea the gaffer had,” he continued.“His plan was to finish in the European spots and thankfully weve achieved that. For me personally, I thought I probably started the season a bit slow. Obviously it was a new team, a new league and playing out wide was dferent. But I adapted and the boys made it easy for me.“I learned when to make runs and movements when certain players had the ball and they made it so easy for me to adapt and get used to the tempo and the way football is played here.“Thats what we set out to do. Inidually I thought I could get a few goals and help the team out and its been great but to finish top scorer is amazing.Not many players have the experience of scoring a hat trick in front of a packed Brandywell, but Junior, who hita treble at Cork City eralier in the season, will remember that feeling for a long time. It felt great, especially at home as my last one was at Cork and the atmosphere wasnt the same,” he explained. “At home it was brilliant, it was electric, Im so happy.Everyone is so happy and buzzing. Its just amazing. We set out to finish on a high and thankfully we done that. It was a tough game but we worked hard for each other and Im delighted.”Junior has played in a number of dferent postions over the course of the -game season, but he has never complained, becoming a real team player for the Candystripes. Im used to playing up front but Ive enjoyed playing on the wing because football here is played properly,” he stated. “Football is on the floor and it just made it easier for me to settle in and adapt my game. I did the defensive stuff as well. Ive enjoyed it and its been brilliant. Ive really enjoyed it. The boys made it easy for me. Its been amazing.“Coming here, I didnt really know what to expect but its been a good season overall. Its been amazing and Im just happy.  Big decisionEvery Derry City fan will be waiting anxiously to discoverJunior will come back to the Brandywell next season, but it all depends on a number of factors, one of which is Colchester United. I havent really thought about whats next, Junior admitted. “Ive just been focused on the games and getting into Europe so I havent really thought much about the future. Anything can happen. I dont know whats going to happen but Im just so delighted with the win.Off the pitch its been good. Ive always said that everyone in the city has been brilliant with me. Going out, everyone has been friendly and its just been a friendly environment and I havent had any trouble since Ive been here. Its been great.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They issued some pointers on how to keep your animals safe: Microchipping The ISPCA strongly recommend that all dog owners have their pet’s microchipped in case they are taken or go missing over Halloween. This is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old and failure to do so is an offence under the Animal Health  Welfare Act  . Dog owners need to be in possession of a microchipping certicate also so it is important your contact details are kept up-to-date. It is the pet owner’s responsibility to inform the database operator of any change of contact details so once your dog has been microchipped, check the database to ensure your details are correct. googletag.cmd.push If your pet becomes lost, having them microchipped is the best way to ensure they will be reunited with you as it’s the first thing a veterinary practice, rescue centre or dog warden do is to scan your pet for a microchip. Lost animals puts a lot of extra pressure on animal rescue centres, dog pounds and veterinary practices but it also causes more upset for pets and their owners so don’t delay and get your dog microchipped today – it’s the law!. While microchipping is recommended for all cat owners as well as dogs, there are no current plans to make microchipping compulsory for cats. Help your pets during Halloween Pet owners can help train their dogs and cats to become accustomed to the sounds of Halloween fireworks by playing similar sounds at low volumes. As dficult as it may be, try not to react to your pet showing signs of fear as it may be the best way you can help them. Licking objects such as toys filled with treats may help ease your pet’s stress. If they are up for it, playing with them may also be a welcome distraction, but don’t force ityour pet is too upset to play. Walk your dog in the morning and earlier evening away from any fireworks. If you are concerned that your pet is unmanageably terried of the noise of fireworks, you should consult your vet to discuss ways for managing your pet’s stress. Outdoor pets including small mammals or birds should also be brought indoors into a secure garage or shed where they can be secure from any loud noise or fireworks. You can also cover hutches or cages with blankets to act as sound-proofing. Horses, ponies and donkeys should also be microchipped, and those that live in areas with a considerable amount of Halloween-related noise should be securely stabled to prevent them from escaping or hurting themselves. Keep sweets and decorations out of reach Dogs and cats should be kept away from sweets and Halloween decorations. Chocolate and raisins are highly toxic to pets, as are any sweets containing the sugar substitute xylitol. Ingesting foil or plastic wrappers can also lead to digestive problems and may require surgery. If your pet does ingest something toxic, contact your vet immediately. Beware of costumes Not all pets will tolerate wearing costumes and it may cause them undue stress. Only dress up your pet for Halloweenyou know they enjoy it. Halloween themed bandanas can be less restrictive soyou do choose to put your pet in a costume, make sure it does not limit the animal’s movement, vision, ability to breathe or behave normally. Also ensure any costume doesn’t have any small, chewable pieces or toxic paints or dyes. People wearing Halloween costumes can be equally as scary to pets. Masks or other costume accessories may trigger their territorial instincts. While people might enjoy being spooked during the Halloween festivities, it’s not fun for pets. If your pet is scared, ensure they are in a separate room and safe place. Look out for wildle Hedgehogs go into hibernation this time of year and will sleep in woodpiles or heavy scrub and leaves. It is important you check under all woodpiles before lighting any bonfires to ensure there is no wildle hibernating. Some outdoor decorations such a fake spider webs or string lights can snare wild animals, so be careful about hanging them and remove them after the festivities. Report animal cruelty Unfortunately, stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks. If you witness animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on  orreport online. ISPCA Public Relations Manager Carmel Murray said:“While we all enjoy the festivities of Halloween, many pets and wildle will find this time of year terrying. It is important that they have a secure place to hide indoorsthey are frightened by the noises of fireworks and trick-or-treaters calling to the door. Leaving the lights low, and playing the radio or television can help drown out some of the sounds as it can be a stressful time for them. It is also important our pets are kept safe in a secure room where they cannot dart out an open door. If your pet manages to escape, it is important they are wearing an ID tag plus they should be microchipped, which is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old. Pets that have been found will be scanned for a microchip which holds the pet owners contact details so it is important this information is kept up to date. Carmel added: Halloween can also be a dangerous time for our wildle so it is important to check under wood, scrub and leaves for hibernating hedgehogs before lighting any bonfires. Sadly stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks soyou witness any animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and report it to the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on   .”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It proved really successful, and from then my workshop has been full.”“The Go For It Programme has opened many doors for me, including Derry City and Strabane District Councils pound, Business Start Up Challenge, where I was a runner up and was awarded pound,. “I was also named North West Business Person of the Year at the recent North West Business Awards. “These opportunities would have passed me byit hadn’t been for the Go For It Programme.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean Bell started the ball rolling for the Downpatrick side with a great opening point. However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South. Sadly these have been down for nearly three years, she said.The Baroness added: ldquoMy appointment to the House of Lords is an evolution. I was elected to Down Council in , was the organisationrsquos first female chairman, worked as MP Eddie McGradyrsquos parliamentary secretary, became an MLA and MP for South Down and a Minister in the Stormont administration.ldquoIt is now the House of Lords which represents a new challenge and an opportunity which I fully intend to grasp and embrace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/23rd October 2019 Bid.jpg","title":"Bid for community centre in Crossgar  ","story":"A CALL has been made for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to keep the pressure on the Department for Communities to fund a new community centre in Crossgar.The village will be left without a building used to host a number community events when the Downpatrick Street property is sold.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area.

This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In that role, he said that he had encouraged a company which had operations in both Scotland and the Republic of Ireland to expand into Northern Ireland..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Aiken told the News Letter: “The guy who was a very senior executive - I obviously won’t mention the company’s name - just said: ‘Northern Ireland is corrupt’.“I said ‘what do you mean, it’s corrupt ’ Mr Aiken said that the man had then gone on to outline in some detail a series of concerns about how some in Stormont interacted with some businesses.Mr Aiken said: “I was thinking ‘No, no. This is Britain, this doesn’t happen in Britain this is not how we do business’. And then I had that sense that something was broken in Northern Ireland...I started getting the sense that something was fundamentally broken in Northern Ireland, which made me sad because even though I’ve spent  years away at sea in the Navy and doing ious things I’ve always had my home in Northern Ireland, my eldest kids and now my youngest kids have been educated in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland has got so many advantages going for it.”Mr Aiken said that what he had heard over the intervening years had left him “quite concerned” that there was “institutional corruption” within aspects of Northern Irish society.However, Mr Aiken made clear that he was staunchly unionist and, despite voting remain in the EU referendum, he was totally opposed to a border poll.The Ballyclare man said that after leaving the Navy he lived in Dublin and loved both the city and Irish people. However, he said that his eyes were opened by the high taxes, health insurance charges, huge rent and childcare costs and infrastructure problems in areas such as water treatment which resulted in water periodically having to be boiled before drinking.• Background information on Steve AikenSteve Aiken, whose father was a trade union official, said that his own politics were “one nation Labour or even one nation centrist Conservativeism”. and Ronan Hughes. \"   and Ronan Hughes. \"  ESSEX LORRY DEATHS LATEST | Police hunt N.I. brothers wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailer in EssexPolice probe kidnap attempt in Milton Keynes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Aiken is not a member of any of the loyal orders - although he is Freemason.Mr Aiken said he was “very supportive of the loyal orders” and attends the Twelfth. Although Mike Nesbitt was the first UUP leader not to be a member of the Orange Order when he was elected in , Mr Aiken’s unopposed ascent to the UUP leadership is further evidence of the weakened influence of the loyal orders within unionism.

Boris Johnson`s deal with the EU is an existential threat to the Union. It puts a border in the Irish Sea and places Northern Ireland on the window ledge of the Union.”He continued: “This election will be an opportunity to send Ulster Unionist MPs to Westminster who will not be patsies to a Tory government or ever agree to a border down the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland has been betrayed by Boris Johnson`s Conservative Government and we need to send a clear message to him and his advisers that we will not sit back and let him destroy the Union.”Mr Aiken added: “Anyone who casts a vote for Sinn Fein is wasting an opportunity to have their voice heard in Westminster. More than ever Northern Ireland needs MPs who will attend the House of Commons and exercise the democratic mandate. Northern Ireland needs MPs who are focused on improving the lives of their constituents and strengthening the Union rather than filling their boots, taking holidays in foreign countries and then lobbying on their behalf. That`s why I`ll be urging people to vote Ulster Unionist.”\"  \"  UK on course for pre-Christmas election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Alliance leader Naomi Long sought to position her party as a voice for Remain.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.Mrs Long added: “We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”The SDLP said the election was a defining moment.Their party leader, Colum Eastwood, said: “For three years, the democratic decision taken by people in Northern Ireland to reject a border on this island, to maintain the free and frictionless relationship we enjoy with Europe and to sustain our fragile peace has been wilfully ignored by successive Conservative governments and by the DUP. The coming election is an opportunity to reject the politics of ision and deadlock and defend our interests.”Mr Eastwood added: “This island’s destiny is being decided at Westminster. Like it or not, the only way to prevent the kind of outcome that would devastate our communities is to show up and vote it down. Our MPs have, with the exception of Sylvia Hermon, either facilitated this disaster or stood outside on the lawn shouting in. They have failed to defend our interests. It’s time to give the electorate a chance to cast their verdict on that failure.”Sinn Fein said the election could be used to show support for a referendum on Irish unity.Their party leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, said: “This election is about our future.“It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit. “It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.”She continued: “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north.”Mrs O’Neill added: “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.”try catch  TrendingLATEST | Essex Police hunt N.I. brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailerTeenager killed

three days earlier than ministers wanted.The vote effectively clears the way for Parliament to be dissolved on November , paving the way for an election on December ..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The opposition parties had wanted to bring forward polling day to cut off any possibility Mr Johnson could make a fresh attempt to ram through his Brexit deal before Parliament is dissolved.However, Downing Street warned that it was not “logistically possible” while Government sources accused the opposition of a deliberate attempt to scupper the whole election.It will now go to the House of Lords, but after being approved by MPs it is unlikely that it will be held up by the unelected upper chamber.The one-page Bill sets aside the provisions of the Fixed-Term Parliament’s Act, meaning the Government did not require a two-thirds “super majority” to get it through.The result means Mr Johnson finally has within his grasp the election he has been pushing for since September after three previous attempts - the most recent on Monday - failed.Following the vote, Jeremy Corbyn said: “This election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country and take on the vested interests holding people back.”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson confirmed they would be campaigning on a  to halt Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.“It is our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit,” she said.“The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of Remain and will be standing on a manesto to stop Brexit by revoking Article .”Steve Aiken: ‘Aspects of Stormont governance are institutionally corrupt and require radical reform’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The breakthrough came after Mr Corbyn finally bowed to intense pressure and agreed in principle to support an election.It followed the announcement at the weekend by the Lib Dems and the SNP that they would support an electionthey could be sure Mr Johnson would not reintroduce the Withdrawal Agreement Billto raty his Brexit deal.Following a meeting of the shadow cabinet, the Labour leader said their condition that a no-deal-Brexit was taken “off the table” had finally been met after the EU agreed to another extension to the end of January.“I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table,” he said.“We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.”However, with the party trailing in the polls, many Labour MPs are deeply unhappy at the prospect of an election in the run-up to Christmas.More than  signed an amendment calling for the election to be delayed to May .try catch  TrendingLATEST | Essex Police hunt N.I. brothers Ronan and Christopher Hughes wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailerTeenager killed in NI road traffic collision -

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He self-harmed and was under constant supervision multiple times.ndash At Yarlrsquos Wood, a young man with epilepsy and a learning disability, whose health deteriorated as a result of the trauma and uncertainty of detention, was released after concerns were raised.ndash At Morton Hall in Lincolnshire, there were  acts of self-harm, with a number of ldquoprolic self-harmers amongst the detainees, particularly in the second half of the year.ndash Across just three centres ndash Yarlrsquos Wood, Heathrow and Brook House by Gatwick Airport ndash  people were sectioned under the Mental Health Act during .But the report also said the number of people in detention decreased after the Windrush scandal, there were fewer examples of people being held for excessive periods and conditions were seen to improve.Rudy Schulkind, research and policy co-ordinator at the organisation Bail for Immigration Detainees , accused the Home Office of ldquofrequently failing to provide ldquoadequate reasons for its decisions to detain someone, adding that it should only be used ldquoas a last resort to effect enforced removal from the UK.He said: ldquoThe impression given by these figures is that detention fails to achieve its stated aim in the majority of cases and is frequently used to coerce people into leaving the UK when the Home Office is in fact not in a position to enforce their removal.ldquoThis is nothing more than pointless cruelty inflicted upon iniduals who find themselves in detention when they have not committed any crime or even had their detention authorised by a court of law.The report also backed the findings of two parliamentary committees in urging a detention time limit to be brought in and indefinite detention to be scrapped.James Wilson, acting director of Detention Action, welcomed the news and saidpoliticians were ldquoclamouring for a -day time limit to be brought in, adding: ldquoWith the IMBs now joining, we hope the Government finally sees sense and implements this most basic of safeguards.Dame Anne Owers, national chairman of IMBs, said: ldquoWhile some improvements have been made, sometimes in direct response to IMBs raising concerns, there are still serious concerns about the use and effect of immigration detention.ldquoProcedures for recognising and responding to vulnerability were not working consistently, and we will be continuing to monitor this over the coming year.A Home Office spokeswoman said: ldquoDetention is an important part of the immigration system ndash but it must be fair, dignied and protect the most vulnerable.ldquoWe have made signicant improvements to our approach in recent years, but remain committed to going further.ldquoWe continue to explore alternatives to detention, increase transparency around immigration detention, further improve the support available for vulnerable detainees and initiate a new drive on detainee dignity..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Less than half of immigration centre detainees deported last year  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
