The photographer invited his son, Simon, then aged 18, to the studio to meet The Beatles, according to the book.‘The atmosphere there was laid back: just four young phenomenally talented lads from Liverpool having a lot of fun. But, and this is a big ‘but,’ they were under the watchful care of that supreme Svengali, George Martin,’ Simon Parkinson recounted in the book. ‘He seemed to be everywhere.’George Martin was the producer on many of the band’s records, and has been referred to as the ‘fifth Beatle.’After ‘Don’t Bother Me,’ Parkinson photographed the band with Martin at the basement canteen at Abbey Road. After the break for the tea, the band was at it again, finishing ‘I Wanna Be Your Man,’ and the recording session ended up at around 11pm, according to the book.‘My father really enjoyed working with The Beatles, (recognizing) their enormous talent,’ Simon Parkinson said in the book. Norman Parkinson died in 1990. The photos he took that September day first appeared in ‘Queen,’ the magazine, and then for ‘The Beatles Book,’ a 40-page glossy magazine published in early 1964. Journalist Maureen Cleave provided the text for the glossy, and in 1966 she would interview Lennon when he said the group was ‘more popular than Jesus now.’Not long after that September photo shoot, The Beatles earned their second number 1 hit with ‘Love Me Do,’ and Beatlemania was born. The group headed to America in February 1964, and \u0027I want hold your hand\u0027 was a hit.

I didn\u0027t want to spoil it for anyone.\u0027This Christmas might also have been one to be endured rather than enjoyed for Ken, had it not been for the arrival of another lady in his life.No, he hasn\u0027t found love again. Or at least, not that sort of love. But Ken was one of the stars of this year\u0027s heartwarming TV series Old People\u0027s Home for 4 Year Olds, the Channel 4 programme that ships a busload of excitable youngsters into a retirement home, and tests what happens next.In Ken\u0027s case, what happened was something he was wholly unprepared for: life becoming fun again.The hermit widower, who had resigned himself to a solitary existence, was paired up with a little girl called Lily (or Lily Bobtail, as she insisted on being called). Lily may have seemed rather a bossy little madam — her opening gambit, over lunch, was to ask whether Ken would like to swap his chips for her vegetables — but the pair quickly became inseparable.          Pauleen Davies, who was a magistrate for 25 years, formed a special bond with Ismail during the popular show on Channel 4Now the cameras have returned for a Christmas special, which sees Ken despatched to a toyshop to buy presents not just for Lily but for all the children in the experiment.\u0027Even with our own grandchildren, my wife did it all, and when they got that little bit older we gave them cheques so they could buy what they liked. When they asked me to go to the toyshop I thought, \u0027hang on, but there are nine ladies here\u0027. I realised very quickly what they were doing.\u0027How did the gruff pensioner (\u0027I don\u0027t like shopping,\u0027 he complains at the start) react to being practically frogmarched to the toyshop?Well, he thoroughly enjoyed it, even when he found himself playing a game called Pie Face that involved him having whipped cream splattered on his nose. He and another retirement-home pal turned into big kids themselves as they tried on giant- sized panda and bear heads.\u0027Well, it was the most fun I\u0027d had in ages,\u0027 he admits. \u0027Even if they forced me into it.\u0027The enchanting Old People\u0027s Home for 4 Year Olds has now helped two sets of pensioners in different retirement homes.          The heartwarming social experiment allowed pensioners and four-year-old\u0027s to spend time together When the programme was conceived, Channel 4 went to great lengths to present it as a bona fide social experiment. An army of experts was enlisted to run a series of tests on the pensioners involved, to see if daily contact with children made them more physically active, alert and, well, alive.Studies in other countries, particularly ones where there is a policy of combining nursery schools and retirement homes on one site, have suggested the interaction is beneficial to all.Much of the programme is involved with setting the participants tasks, then, at various points, assessing how agile they are and how depressed they feel.But in truth you don\u0027t need people with clipboards to convince you this experiment works. You just need to talk to the elderly people themselves — and the parents of the children, for that matter.That the residents of Lark Hill retirement village in Nottingham stayed in touch with their respective charges even after the cameras stopped rolling tells its own story.A more powerful one is told with Ken\u0027s wide smile as he explains how contact has been maintained.\u0027We go to see them and they come to us,\u0027 he says of the children. \u0027Last Saturday they all came over with their parents and had lunch. I think there were 40 of us in total. It\u0027s like acquiring a whole load of new great-grandchildren. When we see them it makes the whole week brighter.\u0027          Experts ran a series of tests on the pensioners to see if daily contact with the children made them more physically active, alert and, well, aliveLily Bobtail may still be his No 1 friend, but Ken confides that he has also become close to another family who took part in the show.Scarlett Pollard\u0027s father Tim had allowed her to take part, but with some trepidation. Scarlett had lost her mum Sally to cancer just months before filming started. The scenes where Scarlett told her new friend Beryl, 84, that her mum was dead left viewers in bits. \u0027I have a heartache,\u0027 she explained.It seems that ever since, Scarlett and her dad have been scooped up by the residents of Lark Hill — something Tim describes as \u0027completely unexpected\u0027.\u0027They\u0027ve become friends — family really,\u0027 he says. \u0027I had no idea of the impact doing this would have on our lives. \u0027I agreed to do it in the first place because, like most parents, I wanted to see what Scarlett was like when I wasn\u0027t around.\u0027Because we had just lost Sal, I was worried about her. But to see her not only making friends but friends she could open up to about what she was feeling was incredible.\u0027How did he feel, though, when he watched his daughter explain for the first time that her mum was dead?\u0027It was a punch in the gut,\u0027 he admits. \u0027But there was also relief that she could say it, that she had found someone like Beryl who she was comfortable enough with to say it. I always remember the words she used: \u0027My mum died.\u0027 The voiceover came in at this point and said \u0027Sally passed away…\u0027. I thought that was striking. It\u0027s the adults who try to sugarcoat it with the language they use.\u0027 Scarlett is again a standout star in the Christmas special, which involves the children laying on a festive show and inviting other elderly people in the neighbourhood to come along.           When the programme was conceived, Channel 4 went to great lengths to present it as a bona fide social experimentShe is the one who asks the residents to help her with something she doesn\u0027t understand.\u0027Why doesn\u0027t he have claws when he\u0027s called Santa Claus?\u0027 she asks, as any hint of morose mood evaporates.Yet her dad says the residents of Lark Hill — all of whom have had their own heartbreaks — have become unofficial grief counsellors for his daughter. \u0027They have all experienced loss, so I think it has normalised it for Scarlett. \u0027She knows there are other people who have lost mummies and daddies, and husbands and wives.\u0027He has benefited from that wealth of experience too. Tim says he sat next to Ken at a special screening of the Christmas show, and the tears flowed at the part where Ken was watching his wife Barbara walking across the screen.\u0027I put my arm around him, hoping he wouldn\u0027t mind,\u0027 says Tim. \u0027We\u0027ve actually become very close, which I didn\u0027t expect. Ken knows what it is to lose his wife. He has gone through a lot of the things I\u0027ve been through.\u0027Tim is definitely a convert to the idea that retirement homes and nursery facilities should be combined. \u0027It\u0027s a no-brainer because it\u0027s the way it used to be. I think it should be rolled out in every town. It\u0027s a win-win for everyone.\u0027That is a sentiment shared by retired teacher and magistrate Pauleen Davies, who is 92. Pauleen is a no-nonsense type who thinks she was chosen to appear in the show because she was \u0027a bit bossy and an antidote to the sad souls\u0027.She challenges the idea that all elderly people in residential homes are lonely or worn down by life. She kicks off our chat in sparky fashion by pointing out that it\u0027s the male residents of Lark Hill who tend to have turned their faces to the wall and lost the will to live.\u0027Think about it,\u0027 she says. \u0027There were nine women in the show and three men. Who was doing the moping?\u0027Isn\u0027t it often the case that men are hit harder by the loss of a partner, though?\u0027I think that\u0027s true. The women do the organising, so when they die the men are lost. I mean, I miss my husband terribly. When he first died, I used to look at the empty armchair and think \u0027how could you do this to me? How could you leave me?\u0027 but you have to go on. Life has to go on.\u0027Pauleen moved to Lark Hill nine years ago, after a fall on some ice made her realise she had to \u0027start planning for my future, so as not to be a burden on my children\u0027. Her two sons live nearby, but Lark Hill has been the perfect solution for her.She says she has hopefully made a friend for life in young Ismail, the little boy she was paired with. His family, too, have come to visit. \u0027We have a shindig about once a month,\u0027 she says.She has watched, incredulous, as the more troubled souls around her have been transformed by the children\u0027s presence. \u0027It has made the world of difference to Ken. People like Ken keep themselves to themselves and don\u0027t feel the need to integrate, but now he wants to.\u0027Ken becomes quite emotional when I ask what his beloved Barbie would make of his new friends and the joy they have given him.\u0027Oh, she would be thrilled,\u0027 he says. \u0027She loved children. I used to call her the Pied Piper because they always flocked to her. She\u0027d love this, I think. I know she\u0027d want me to be happy. And I am.\u0027Old People\u0027s Home For 4 Year Olds at Christmas is on Channel 4 tomorrow at 9pm."},{"url":null,"title":"JACK DOYLE French Presidents Brexit hand grenade","story":"     \u0027After a punishing day in the office, Theresa May likes to relax with a glass of Welsh whisky. After yesterday – after her very public and painful decision to postpone her Brexit vote – the Prime Minister could be forgiven for pouring herself a double\u0027 writes JACK DOYLE The reason? The knotty issue of the Northern Ireland backstop and fears of a defeat on a scale of anything up to 150 votes.Last night her supporters laid at least part of the blame squarely on embattled French President Emmanuel Macron. Two weeks ago, on the Sunday of the EU Summit in Brussels when Mrs May\u0027s deal was signed, No10 officials were cautiously optimistic.\u0027We had a mountain to climb, but we thought we had some momentum and could get away from the backstop to start selling the deal on its merits – control of borders and protecting jobs,\u0027 says one aide.But then came the Macron hand grenade. The French President – desperate to focus attention away from the riots at home – broke ranks.The UK would still have to give way on the hugely sensitive area of fishing, he warned, or facing being stuck in the Northern Ireland backstop in perpetuity.\u0027It was backstop blackmail, and we never recovered,\u0027 a source admits. The next day, Mrs May faced question after question on the backstop. Then Donald Trump – in typical style – declared this was \u0027a great deal for the EU\u0027.No10\u0027s strategy to pressure MPs by building support among voters and business became irrelevant. \u0027They were just talking to each other about how much they didn\u0027t like the backstop\u0027, a source sighs.On November 30, a little-known Remain-supporting minister, Sam Gyimah, quit, and called for a second referendum. Meanwhile, the informal Twitter count of Tory MPs opposed to the deal crept higher and higher.The other name Downing Street officials spit with fury is that of Speaker Bercow. By selecting MP after MP opposed to the deal every time Mrs May appeared before them, he too created the impression the agreement was friendless.Controversially, he selected an amendment proposed by arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve designed to hand Parliament power over what happens if the deal fell. It was, Tory sources say, a highly contentious move.In a single calamitous day, last Tuesday, the Government lost that vote and two others. It forced the publication of the Attorney General\u0027s legal advice, a letter which made clear the risk of being stuck inside the backstop. Passages pointing to reasons why the EU hated the backstop were largely ignored.Now several Cabinet ministers and backbenchers were hammering away trying to convince No10 to pull the vote. Chief among them was Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson who, as a former chief whip, knew the grim reality of the numbers.           \u0027At breakfast yesterday, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said he was \u0027100 per cent\u0027 sure the vote was still on\u0027But the message wasn\u0027t getting through. Sir Graham Brady, the \u0027shop steward\u0027 of backbench Tories, begged the PM to delay. He went public last Thursday, saying Mrs May risked losing her job if she went ahead.Among some May loyalists, considerable ire is also reserved for the Chief Whip, Julian Smith and what one minister called a \u0027shambolic\u0027 whipping operation.Incredibly, last week he even allowed a TV crew to film him trying to convince the hardest of hardline Tory Eurosceptics, Philip Davis, to back the deal – an attempt which, predictably, failed. One senior Tory told the Mail it was \u0027******* mad\u0027.At yesterday\u0027s Cabinet call International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt raised eyebrows among her fellow ministers by praising Mr Smith\u0027s efforts to win the vote – despite his utter failure.Yesterday Mrs May was told the likely scale of defeat – as many as 150 votes.More than 50 Labour MPs demand Corbyn calls a vote of no...Theresa May declares that she is not capable of...Share this articleThe argument that it was better to suffer a defeat and take it to Brussels to show how much help was needed, rapidly fell away.A defeat of such magnitude would leave Mrs May\u0027s very future in No10 in grave peril and the country in chaos.\u0027For her, it\u0027s duty, duty. duty,\u0027 said one aide last night – seeking to explain why she doesn\u0027t simply throw in the towel.What happens next? Mrs May has pledged to \u0027go boldly\u0027 back to the European Union.The question is whether there is anything the EU is prepared to offer which will buy off enough Tory MPs, or if pulling the vote has simply delayed the inevitable. She needs, as one former Cabinet minister told the Mail yesterday, to pull a \u0027very large rabbit out of the hat\u0027.Mrs May has been written off before – again and again – and yet survived. But if she is to defy her critics again she will need every bit of luck she can muster."},{"url":null,"title":"Explorer Titanic says mission ruse trick Russians","story":"    Explorer Robert Ballard (seen above in 2015) led the team which found the wreckage of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1985The discovery of the Titanic was initially a mission designed to trick the Soviet Union into thinking that the U.S. military was searching for the doomed ocean liner while it was also looking for two missing nuclear submarines.The Titanic, the luxury ocean liner which tragically sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean after colliding into an iceberg on April 15, 1912, was found on the ocean floor by a team led by Robert Ballard in 1985.Three years before the discovery, Ballard was a naval intelligence officer and oceanographer who was developing his own remote-control underwater vehicle.But he was running out of money and he needed funding, according to CBS News.So he asked the Navy’s Deputy Chief of Operations Ronald Thunman.‘He said, “All my life I\u0027ve wanted to go find the Titanic”,’ Thunman said.‘And I was taken aback by that.‘I said, “Come on, this is a serious, top secret operation. Find the Titanic? That\u0027s crazy!”’Thunman agreed to fund the Titanic expedition on one condition - that Ballard use the money and the time to also locate two nuclear submarines that went missing in the Atlantic in the 1960s.          The Titanic was the luxury ocean liner which tragically sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean after colliding into an iceberg on April 15, 1912On April 10, 1963, the USS Thresher sank during deep-ing tests more than 200 miles off the coast of Boston.

One of them, the USS Thresher, is seen in the above file photo  In 1968, 99 crewmen died when their submarine, the USS Scorpion, mysteriously disappeared near the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago some 1,000 miles west of the European continent. The Scorpion is seen above in Portsmouth, England on May 10, 1960Ballard said he needed the Titanic story as subterfuge.‘It was very top secret,’ Ballard said.‘And so I said, “Well, let\u0027s tell the world I am going after the Titanic”.’Ballard managed to find the Thresher and the Scorpion, but it took him longer than expected.So he only had 12 days left to search for the ruins of the Titanic.‘I learned something from mapping the Scorpion that taught me how to find the Titanic: look for its trail of debris,’ Ballard said.It took him eight days to locate the ship, whereas others searched for nearly two months and didn’t find it, Ballard said.In the final four days before his mission was up, Ballard did underwater filming of the Titanic’s wreckage.          Of the estimated 2,400 who sailed on the Titanic when it left port at Southampton for New York City, more than 1,500 died. The remnants of the Titanic are seen above on the floor of the North Atlantic OceanHe said that his team’s mood changed quickly as it got closer to the wreckage site.‘We realized we were dancing on someone\u0027s grave, and we were embarrassed,’ Ballard said.‘The mood, it was like someone took a wall switch and went click.‘And we became sober, calm, respectful, and we made a promise to never take anything from that ship, and to treat it with great respect.‘You don\u0027t go to Gettysburg with a shovel. You don\u0027t take belt buckles off the Arizona.’Of the estimated 2,400 who sailed on the Titanic when it left port at Southampton for New York City, more than 1,500 died.The ocean liner is the subject of a new exhibit, Titanic: The Untold Story, at National Geographic Museum in Washington, D.C. Titanic: The untold story - A National Geographic Museum exhibit tells the previously-classified tale behind its discovery - CBS News"},{"url":null,"title":"Question Time tweeted BBC shows 2018","story":"    News and current affairs programmes dominated the list of the most tweeted about BBC shows, with Question Time coming top (file photo)          The Andrew Marr Show was in second place.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up, a treat. BerlinBirdie has been re-reading Old Glory, “Jonathan Raban’s account of sailing down the Mississippi in a small yellow boat”:Can this man write a dud sentence? The river becomes a massive character in itself, threatening and powerful, but the riverside towns, their decay or prosperity, also come to life. Raban has an incredible ear for people’s voices and though they’re all vignettes, as he’s just passing through, he gives a fascinating picture of the US in about 1980 (Carter was president) that has strong echoes today in all sorts of ways. Often very humorous - I feel the word “mordant” was invented for Raban.It also makes me very glad that he’s the one in the boat, not me. Terrifying!Hilary Mantel’s Bring Up The Bodies is “superb”, according to bluefairy:I really enjoyed Thomas Cromwell exacting his cold and calculated revenge on Norris, Bereton, Weston and Anne Boleyn in the Tower. I am really looking forward to the last in the series once it’s finally released but I actually like Thomas Cromwell’s character in the books and I’m not looking forward to him dying. I’m not the only one it seems as Hilary Mantel has said this is the sticking point with her writing the last book, she doesn’t want to write about his death.Colin Cotterill’s Love Songs from a Shallow Grave has upset nina1414:The Wayward Bus by John Steinbeck has delighted Dennis89:An absolute joy to read with a cast of characters straight out of an Edward Hopper painting. The sense of life’s frustrations and loneliness amid a backdrop of quiet desperation is so strong you can almost taste it. The guy understood the human condition of that there is no doubt.On the subject of the human condition, Tony Lewis-Jones has been reading Think Like Zuck: The Five Business Secrets of Facebook’s Improbably Brilliant CEO Mark Zuckerberg by Ekaterina Walter:A fascinating insight into the world and modus operandi of modern media and communications’ ‘Pied Piper’. Did you know for instance that Facebook claims to have ‘moles’ in the newsrooms of several major British media organisations, and the Facebook board of directors takes regular conference calls with the Trump White House ?Meanwhile, Stephen V Ash’s Civil War book, A Year in the South: 1865, has given Swelter new perspective:As the title states, historian Ash covers one year in the lives of his four protagonists – a slave in Alabama, a recently widowed mother of 7 in Virginia, the adult son of a small plantation owner in Mississippi, and a young Confederate veteran and former POW in Tennessee – with a prologue summarising what is known of their lives before that year and an epilogue describing their subsequent lives as far as possible.This is a terrific book – Ash gives us these lives with novelistic detail, while efficiently and clearly filling in historical and social contexts where necessary. Beyond putting a human face on historic events, each of the characters becomes a rounded personality in whose fortunes the reader becomes involved … This would make for thoughtful reading over the New Year – offering material for reflecting on how much or how little change a year can bring to a human life.But before we get to the New Year, there’s Christmas and JayZed has just the thing for that:I treated myself to an early Christmas present last week and bought The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story, edited by Philip Hensher, which is an absolute delight. I’ve indulged myself over the weekend and have particularly enjoyed stories by AL Kennedy, Ali Smith and Jackie Kay, although many of the stories that are not by Scottish women are also very good. It’s making me appreciate what a fine art form the short story is and how much skill and technique it takes to write a good one. I’ve never been much of a short story reader before but need to change that habit.Sounds like a worthy resolution.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

As a centenary tribute, could I follow his routines for 24 hours?With the publication of his short novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in 1962, Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn became the first to chronicle the crushing brutality of daily life in the Soviet Union’s prison camps. Sentenced without trial to eight years forced labour and persecuted for years by the KGB, the Nobel prize-winning writer was a spiritual and moral authority for thousands of Russians until his death at the age of 89 in 2008.But – dare I ask – do the harrowing details of his biography, and the weightiness of the tomes that he wrote, cause us to take Solzhenitsyn a little too seriously? Blinded by the big bushy beard and loose peasant’s smock that gave him the aura of an Old Testament figure, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Solzhenitsyn’s lifelong ascetic tendencies, stretching long before and after his imprisonment, are almost as endearingly eccentric as they are admirable.To mark 11 December’s 100th anniversary of his birth, I decided to spend 24 hours in the life of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. I’ll never complain about Friday-night deadlines again.1am: Wake up. When he was writing his monumental attack on the Soviet regime, The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn would rise at 1am, work until 9am, grudgingly take a short break, then pick back up again until 6pm.I spot the moon through my curtains, decide that battling authoritarianism can wait a few more hours, roll over and go back to sleep.6am: Fell at the first hurdle. But it’s onwards and upwards from here.6.10am: It is breakfast time. Each year on 9 February, Solzhenitsyn would mark the day he was first arrested in 1945. On his self-styled Convict’s Day he would allow himself only the rations he had been permitted by the camp authorities: 23 ounces of bread, a bowl of broth and a ladle of oats.It might be December, but I’m going to recreate this feast. Lacking the traditional gourmet delights of a gulag kitchen, a dissolved Oxo cube, some slightly stale slices of toast and a sprinkling of corn flakes seem like a suitably unsatisfying substitute.6.30am: Shuffle sheepishly back to the kitchen. Apparently, 21st-century stomachs aren’t as hardy as those bred in the Russian Caucasus 100 years ago. Two poached eggs later and I am revived and raring to get to work.7am: I turn on my laptop and begin my research into Solzhenitsyn’s life. A man who would make Margaret Thatcher’s working hours look like Homer Simpson’s, the author was still feverishly craning over his notebooks for more than 14 hours a day well into his 80s – despite acute problems with his spine that left him unable to walk.10am: Time for a spot of (not so) light reading, of Solzhenitsyn’s 581-page novel The First Circle. When he was 10, Solzhenitsyn read the entirety of War and Peace and decided that he would write an equivalent saga of the Russian Revolution. At the end of his life he was working on a 20-volume epic, about four times longer than Tolstoy’s, entitled The Red Wheel.10.03am: Somewhat distracted, I check my Facebook feed. Inspecting a friend’s Majorca holiday snaps with her new boyfriend, I feel a twinge of guilt. Would Solzhenitsyn approve of my wanton interest in such frivolous matters? I think not.When the author first began a relationship with his wife at university, it was with the caveat that their meetings should last only an hour and take place after the libraries closed at 10pm. Even during these fleeting amorous rendezvous he would ask her to quiz him on his history dates.Later in his life, Solzhenitsyn embarked on a passionate affair with the brilliant mathematician Olga Ladyzhenskaya – but the romance ended when he decided that sex was distracting him from his writing. I diligently reopen the BBC’s Timeline of the history of the Soviet Union.11am: After he was exiled from the USSR in 1974, Solzhenitsyn entered a self-imposed confinement in the US. He shut himself away to work undisturbed and began a hermitic existence in a log cabin deep in the mountains of Vermont. Surrounding himself with Russian prison archives and a barbed-wire fence, Solzhenitsyn had the shop owners in the nearest village place signs in their windows warning journalists: “NO directions to the Solzhenitsyns.”I go for a quick stroll to the shops. After smiling and nodding at the postman, I quickly realise my mistake and shove on a pair of dark glasses to regain my cover. Solzhenitsyn would not smile at strangers.2pm: Back at my desk, I try to recall fragments of what I’d been reading about the author’s biography.Solzhenitsyn cultivated a unique writing method during his prison years: he would scribble lines for his future novels on scraps of paper, memorise the words and then swiftly burn them before they were discovered. I jot down what I can remember on a Post-it, grab a match and begin cremating my still-sticky note. By the time the last fluorescent pink slither has curled into ash, I’ve forgotten my Solzhenitsyn fun fact. Back to Wikipedia it is …6pm: My working day finally finished, there’s just enough time to enjoy a well-earned dinner (the rest of my stock cube broth and some more stale bread) and still be in bed by 7pm in line with the Solzhenitsyn family clock.7pm: Before tucking myself in, I place a pair of knitting needles next to the pillow (just in case of any unwelcome night-time knocks on the door). For many years Solzhenitsyn would sleep with a pitchfork next to his bed. A year after he was awarded the Nobel prize for literature, the KGB tried to assassinate the writer by arranging for a poisoned needle to be stabbed into his back. Though surely there are no Russian agents lurking around my home in sleepy Wiltshire …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/847cf9bac81ce3aee11da8437fdce822428915bc/0_72_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebd3309ec3de0cd17a129f208b3552e0","title":"brexit may vote postpone parliamentary deal","story":"It must not be no deal, which would make the poor poorer, disrupt the economy, isolate the country internationally, further empower racism, and revive the toxic issues of Irish unification and Scottish independence.It’s unlikely to be Theresa May’s deal, though she may come back with sweeteners from the EU27. The problem she cannot overcome in this hung parliament is the synergetic fanaticism of the retro-imperialist Tory right and the DUP. Together they have made the backstop issue totemic because – in time-honoured fashion – they wish to retain the UK’s freedom to inflict unilateral damage on Ireland.Nevertheless, May has levers against the less hardline leavers. One is her own patent determination to go the extra mile. But the most effective is the ticking of the clock and the well-placed fear of no deal. May’s deal, for all its faults, would be the better option.Nevertheless there is a third option, although it is extremely fraught and contingent. It involves, first, pausing article 50, second, offering a Norway-plus arrangement and, third, if that is rejected, calling a second referendum on the original issue of remain or leave. But this depends on two huge things happening at Westminster.First, it needs Tory leadership, possibly (though improbably) from May herself, or from a liberal Tory such as Amber Rudd, to offer a new cross-party, backbench-based pact – including both Labour and the SNP. This would be, in effect though not name, an unofficial, strictly temporary, issue-based, national parliamentary government.Second, Labour needs to support it. This would almost certainly take place against Jeremy Corbyn’s will. The consequences for politics would be disruptive and long-lasting. But it is hard to see another way of preventing Brexit from destroying our national life – other than May getting her deal, for which there is no majority.It is often said there is still a Commons majority for a softer Brexit or a second vote. At present, however, for all John Bercow’s heroic efforts, this majority remains an angel imprisoned within a block of marble from which it has not yet been carved. Without a sculptor, however, we are heading for no deal.How can Theresa May snatch victory from the jaws of defeat? The prime minister’s decision to delay the vote on her Brexit deal came from a place of weakness after ministers convinced her that the scale of defeat would prove fatal not just to the deal but to her entire premiership.Yet in choosing to delay, May has stored up more problems for herself. Arch-Brexiteers and arch-remainers wanted the vote to proceed so they could finally kill off the deal while May has lost what little goodwill she had with those ministers who were sent on the airwaves to insist the vote would go ahead.May needs to show that she is finally listening to MPs’ concerns and that the troublesome issue of the Irish backstop can be worked on. So far, the signs are not great. May herself appeared to admit that she would not be looking to reopen the legally binding part of the deal. Meanwhile, EU leaders have been quick to say there will be no renegotiation – only a few clarifications.This won’t be enough to assuage the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson. But they are not May’s target audience. What took both the whips and No 10 by surprise in the negative response to the deal was how MPs who come from the middle of the party on Europe – such as Will Quince, Michael Fallon and George Freeman – came out against it.May does, though, appear to be listening to one influential Tory. She heeded the very public advice of Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, to delay the vote until the backstop had been clarified. May now needs to give those MPs who want to back her deal a reason to do so.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondentCalling a vote of no confidence now would hand a reeling Theresa May the lifeline she desperately craves. Given the DUP’s current position is to support the government unless May’s backstop deal is passed, she would win the vote. The narrative would shift to May re-establishing her authority. Those Labour backbenchers and SNP MPs pushing for such a vote know this, of course. Ian Murray, one such Labour MP, told Radio 5 Live on Monday that after the vote of no confidence is “dispensed with” – ie lost – the party would be forced to move on the next component of its party policy, to back a second referendum. They do not want a general election to happen, and indeed it would not happen if a vote is taken now.Labour should instead hold on until May humiliatingly fails, again, to extract any meaningful concessions from the EU. With the government then in even more catastrophically dire straits than now, there would at least be the chance of May losing a vote. That’s in line with the spirit of Labour’s 2018 conference policy, too, which prioritises a general election as “the best outcome for the country”, but that if such an election cannot be engineered, then the party “must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”.It may well be that a second referendum will end up as the only option left standing. It is not the simple big red shiny button its most avid proponents suggest it is. Settling on a question and the number of options will be exceptionally fraught, and such a vote will be a viciously bitter and isive affair, far more so than even last time. Nonetheless, the left has to prepare now for such an eventuality, not least to ensure that a remain campaign is not run by the establishment pro-status quo types who are doomed to defeat. In the meantime, though, if Labour is not going to provoke profound, irreversible disillusionment from leave voters, it has to treat a second referendum as the last possible resort. It can then tell the people of Blackpool, Mansfield and Ashfield that it did everything it could to make it work, but that the party was left with no choice.Anger about the vote being dropped will continue to dominate the mood in parliament. If Labour get a censure motion through, it could open further moves, though a no-confidence motion seems remote just now. Labour inflicted big defeats last week and will keep pressing now – expect it to take advantage of the strong support the Speaker has shown for anything that respects the House.There are many potential plot twists to come. Theresa May’s future depends on how her party reacts. MPs will start looking to the Christmas break, but they are also aware that the clocking is ticking for a negotiated exit. May’s immediate focus is on renegotiation. She will try to extract concessions from the EU, particularly on giving parliament a stronger say or greater reassurance on the backstop. How much she is likely to get we will know in the next few days, and the outlook is not good as the EU is already talking about not re-opening the withdrawal agreement. Yet, as Donald Tusk says, it is keen to help “facilitate UK ratification”.The EU also wants to avoid a no-deal outcome, and we know the UK is stepping up no-deal preparation. We don’t know when the prime minister will come back with answers. After Christmas seems likely, but even with all sides of her disunited party clamouring for answers, she may not control the timetable.• Catherine Haddon is senior fellow at the Institute for Government"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed79359b6f23d27c026e0466ab36ea6923d13aaf/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0cb0951143c6f9d479a3b1265e1c7e4","title":"nicola sturgeon brexit may corbyn leader","story":"May’s current disaster should be Corbyn’s chance, but instead it is the SNP leader who is displaying purpose, energy and gutsWhy can’t there be an English Nicola Sturgeon? That was the cry three years ago, in the wake of her stellar performance during the election debates, although it’s fair to say the shine has worn off since both north and south of the border. Yet this new Brexit crisis threatens to bring it back with a vengeance.The sheer exasperation with which she challenged Jeremy Corbyn to get on with either trying to trigger the general election he says he wants by calling a vote of no confidence in Theresa May, or to stop hiding behind that excuse and back a second referendum, will resonate deeply with many remainers. Enough with the empty posturing about how he’d be ready to take over Brexit negotiations tomorrow if it came to it, when at this rate it will surely never come to it. So long as Labour flaps around feebly insisting that now isn’t the time, suspicion will persist that it never will be the time that all Corbyn really wants is to sit back and let Theresa May take the blame for whatever unpopular decision will be needed to break the parliamentary impasse. If not now, with the government collapsing around our ears, then for heaven’s sake when?Like all the best political questions, Sturgeon’s is all the more unanswerable for being hideously opportunistic. Labour actually has a perfectly legitimate excuse for not calling a vote of no confidence now, although embarrassingly it’s the same excuse May has for not calling a meaningful vote on her Brexit deal it almost certainly wouldn’t win. The DUP is still supporting the prime minister, and until they’re ready to abandon ship, practically speaking it’s fairly pointless. True, there’s nothing stopping Labour from calling another vote of confidence if the first doesn’t succeed, but a string of failed attempts to chisel her out wouldn’t provide the same springboard for any ensuing general election.It’s only fair to point out, too, that all this is easier for Sturgeon than it is for Corbyn. After all, she doesn’t have to lie awake at night worrying about the wrath of leavers in Middlesborough or Hartlepool if their will is overturned. Scotland voted to remain, the SNP is not as ided over Brexit as other parties are, and it does her domestic prospects no harm whatsoever to be seen to be one step ahead of the Labour party in fighting it.But politics is all about opportunism, recognising the moment when it comes and ruthlessly exploiting it. However much May doesn’t want one, parts of Downing Street seem to be reluctantly coming to the conclusion that a second referendum might be unavoidable. (Although she had other reasons for pulling her meaningful vote, one side effect of doing so is that her deal could still just about be put to the people in a referendum that would be infinitely harder had it already been thumpingly defeated in parliament.) There is an uncomfortable truth to Sturgeon’s charge that Labour is now the “biggest barrier and stumbling block” to a second referendum, its leader having had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the point of accepting that this could even be an option.Corbyn’s goal-hanging strategy of letting someone else put in the hard yards over Brexit, before swooping in to electoral glory when it all goes wrong, has served him very well for two years. But the closer we inch to inflicting irreversible damage, the more cowardly it looks. You don’t have to agree with Sturgeon’s politics to agree with her that this is one of those moments when a nation rightly expects politicians to step up, not mill around waiting for someone else to go first.For all her flaws, Sturgeon’s strength is and always has been clarity of purpose. She knows what she wants, has the guts to go after it when an opening arises, and can speak sufficiently fluent human to communicate it even to people sick of hearing about Brexit. That the same cannot be said of either Corbyn or May is both a reflection of the state we’re in, and a bad omen for what may follow. What is painfully absent in this crisis – apart from a workable solution to an impossible problem – is leadership. The reason people respond as they do to Sturgeon is that she reminds us what that looks like."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99b9c332f814eaffb8dfe4b82a421d7ea4aa55f8/0_226_4544_2727/master/4544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed5da1bf16b3b3a30df8f8bf7b10acb5","title":"raheem sterling educate media racism football","story":"Sterling should be free to do his job – play football. But he’s right that the British media needs to tackle racism, head onRaheem Sterling is busy. He is busy being a world-class forward for Manchester City and England and he is busy being a parent. It is therefore confusing as to why, on top of these considerable responsibilities, he is now apparently expected to educate Britain – including a cluster of journalists who claim to know no better – about the media’s role in the racism he experiences both in and on the way to his place of work.Following a Premier League match against Chelsea, during which he stated that he was subjected to a racist tirade from a nearby fan, Sterling took to Instagram to express his concern about the vastly different treatment that white and black players receive from certain sections of the British media. Sterling drew a connection between the negative coverage that black players constantly receive and their treatment by the public.The existence of such a connection was denied by several media personalities, among them Piers Morgan. The problem is that Morgan and too many other prominent public figures cannot be trusted to take this issue seriously. It was Morgan, after all, who used the occasion of the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony – a moment as unifying and optimistic as many British citizens can remember – to call for the return of the British empire, a colonial project so horrifying that the British government has spent years trying to conceal its true extent. “We need to be an empire again – seriously,” tweeted Morgan, seemingly oblivious to the fact that some of those who resisted the empire were castrated with pliers.We have the Sun, whose former managing editor Stig Abell was in charge at a time when one of its columnists – at the very moment that African men, women and children were drowning in the Mediterranean – felt moved to describe these people as “cockroaches”. Abell now plies his trade as a figure of literary respectability, to such an extent that the BBC asked him to front a show on colonialism, interviewing the star of Black Panther.And then we have LBC Radio, one of whose primetime hosts has been accused of language that is “fuel for white supremacists who exploit and spread conspiracy theories about ‘evil, controlling Jews’”.Significant sections of the British media cannot claim to take racism in football, let alone in society, seriously at all when one of its most high-profile writers, the Times’ Matthew Syed, had to be taken patiently to task for his startling misunderstanding and irritated dismissal of a case involving the then England forward, Eniola Aluko.Thankfully, there are fine examples of journalists and media providing essential commentary on this issue but the general pattern, of far too many senior commentators either ill-qualified or too ignorant to address the subject matter with any consistent degree of care or nuance, is a deeply worrying one. Their collective omissions are far too grave to inspire confidence.What, then, is to be done? The first thing is for any reasonable people at these media outlets to ask themselves why they continue to put microphones under the noses of people who have displayed impatience and even contempt for this question to ask themselves whether they are truly doing the best they can, or merely chasing viral content in a time of dying media advertising. At the least, they could work ever more closely with organisations such as the Black Collective of Media in Sport to facilitate greater representation for black people in this field. The second is to stop expecting people who suffer such abuse from fans to be at the forefront of attempts to address it – it would be perverse, after all, to ask a newly diagnosed cancer patient to spearhead the search for its cure. And the third, and the most important, is to help to give Raheem Sterling and other black footballers the consideration and protection in the workplace that they deserve.Sterling is busy enough as it is: he has the European Championships in a couple of years, the World Cup in four, and before both of those he and his team-mates need to deal with a resurgent Liverpool in the Premier League. As a wise man once said, it’s best – as he grapples with those substantial tasks – that he be judged not on the colour of his skin, but on the content of his character.• Musa Okwonga is a poet, journalist and musician"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2dff9a0fa3b91d88c3b7b378e3902ce6621cd50/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df483156d40f6c6324b2cf7c55584285","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of happy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘happy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘happy’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what happy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 December at 10am.

Central to this nomenclature has been Margate’s down-at-heel Cliftonville West ward, with its affordable six-bedroom former B\u0026ampBs, plentiful studio space and urban grit.This seaside suburb is now set to see fee-paying bohemian education added to the mix, with the opening of a “democratic” fee-paying school, where the pupils make the rules and decide what they learn.While the East Kent Sudbury school has been criticised by some as elitist and damaging to other Margate schools, its founder, Kezia Cantwell-Wright, an artist, says it is the future of UK education. “Children aren’t standardised and life isn’t standardised so why should their education be?” she asks.Cantwell-Wright was herself a pupil at Summerhill, the famous “free” fee-paying school in Suffolk. “My own experience and that of other self-directed schools, is that when you give children freedom, they recognise the skills that are essential. They see that numeracy and literacy and communication and problem-solving are essential skills, but on top of that they follow their unique interests.”The Sudbury model does away with structured lessons or compulsory exams in favour of a classroom where five- to 18-year-olds work together with the assistance of teachers. Pupils have as much power as teachers when it comes to running the school. “What the democracy of the school gives them is an opportunity to practise being responsible, for the wellbeing of the whole community,” says Cantwell-Wright. “I just think it’s beautiful, really.”Cantwell-Wright moved to Margate five years ago and could not find a school that felt right for her daughter, so decided to found a school of her own. It will be the first in the UK following the model of the Sudbury Valley School, founded in 1968 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Phase one starts in January 2019, with the new school offering half-time provision for those who home-school, while formal registration with the Department for Education is sought. This registration includes meeting qualitative and teaching standards, as well as premises and leadership tests.Cantwell-Wright hopes to have the school fully operational in a year, with a sliding scale of fees starting at £2,450 part-time and £3,395 for parents earning less than £19,000 a year. Fees peak at £7,000 and £9,700 for those on more than £100,000.“In the future I’d love to offer scholarships to make it even more accessible to those on tighter budgets because we’re not about social ision, we’re about bringing choice to the UK,” she says. Her own role will be as a classroom facilitator and administrator.The school will occupy a small self-contained area, and the rental income will help the centre’s work, but that may not remove the bad taste for some locals.The streets around it contain a mix of agricultural workers, Roma families surviving on zero-hours contracts, and artists. Walk down any street and the poverty is palpable. So is the ide between rich and poor.Paul Luxmoore, executive headteacher of Coastal Academies Trust, which encompasses five schools across the district, is concerned his schools could miss out on the cultural and intellectual capital that incoming middle-class parents bring. The trust encompasses Cliftonville primary, rated outstanding by Ofsted, alongside one selective and three non-selective secondary schools. Some local schools, especially primaries, have struggled in the past. Most have improved, although some still struggle with Ofsted rating stigma.“You’re coming down to live in Margate and opting out of any responsibility for the future of Margate by sending your kids to a private school,” he says. “Did you just want to live in a hipster shabby-chic apartment with views of the sea, or shape and improve the community? Isn’t this an example of Down from Londoners creating an elite community so that they don’t have to interact with the community they have chosen to live in?”He says those who move into the area should participate instead. “They could become governors of schools. We need people who can challenge us so we can improve.”Rochelle Karslake’s nine-year-old son, Cameron, will take up one of the 30 places at the new school in January. She believes the self-directed model will suit Cameron. “I know he will get bored at times, but that is where it really begins,” she says. “I imagine the first weeks will be them running around full of excitement and then the novelty will wear off. Giving a child the responsibility and allowing them to feel what is right for them gives them an intuition, that is a life skill,” she says. “I feel blessed that we have found what I think is the perfect place for him on my doorstep.”But Neil John Griffiths, who is looking at primary schools in Cliftonville for his daughter, feels the school is in the wrong location. “It is offensive that they’re using community space to ide and stratify a community,” he says. Griffiths moved to Margate in 2017 to set up a branch of his Arts Emergency charity, which finds mentors for less-privileged young people who want to pursue careers in the creative industries but lack the social capital or familial links that others benefit from.“We should be giving our privilege to people and projects that can use it, not be writing off the local community,” he says. “Tone-deaf is the politest way that I can describe it. All you are thinking of is building a private school, your next preview and the value of your property. It is a real ‘fuck you’ to a brilliant community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c71030ac6f86b0830d068a137c4967b825e1166/1735_1538_3646_2188/master/3646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6d13f00c2b619171e720c5fd041537c","title":"pupil brings legal action against schools isolation booths outwood grange academies trust","story":"Outwood Grange Academies Trust’s use of ‘consequences rooms’ for hours at a time has drawn criticism from parentsLegal proceedings have been lodged in the high court against an academy trust for its use of so called isolation units to discipline pupils.Lawyers have applied for a judicial review of Outwood Grange Academies Trust’s (OGAT) use of “consequence rooms” – small rooms in which a child sits alone and in silence for hours on end as punishment for breaking school rules. OGAT runs 30 schools across Yorkshire, the Humber and the east Midlands.The application has been made on behalf of a boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, who was kept in one such unit at his school in Yorkshire for a third of the last academic year – 60 full school days.Parents criticised OGAT’s behaviour policy, which in September this year stated that children could be sent to the consequence rooms for up to six hours a day with no teaching. When in the rooms, children were not allowed to “tap, chew, swing on their chairs, shout out, sigh, or any other unacceptable or disruptive behaviour”.“Students cannot sleep or put their heads on the desk. They must sit up and face forward,” the behaviour policy said. “Communication of any kind with any other student is not allowed … You will be escorted to get your lunch, but you must stay silent.”Children were allowed a maximum of three toilet breaks a day for no more than five minutes per visit. “You must use the closest toilet and go directly there and back,” the policy read. When in the consequence rooms pupils could complete work they had brought themselves, but they did not have to.Lawyers are seeking to challenge the legality of the use of the punishment for extended periods of time, the lack of teaching while children are in the rooms and the lack of oversight of the policy. Unlike with fixed-term exclusions, there is no limit on the number of days a child can spend in an isolation booth.According to the trust’s data, released following a freedom of information request, approximately a third of the pupils at the school attended by the boy involved in the legal action had spent time in isolation in the previous year. The average total time pupils spent in isolation booths during the school year was about 15 days.In an interview with Schools Week last week, Martyn Oliver, chief executive of the trust, said the strict expectations for pupil behaviour were about “setting a reasonable level of behaviour in turnaround schools, to prevent chaos”.The mother of the student who is bringing the claim said: “No child should have to go through what my son has been through. He is not an easy boy, but the effect of the isolations on him have been devastating. Last year, he spent almost a third of his time at school in the booths. That is not what education is about. This has to change.”A spokesperson for OGAT said: “In order to experience just half a day in our consequences room, where children are supported to reflect on their behaviour, a child will have ignored four warnings and have failed two separate detentions. We also apply reasonable adjustments and have a wealth of supportive and alternative intervention packages for those children who need additional support to manage their behaviour in school.“Our behaviour policy and practices have been reviewed by Ofsted in over 20 inspections, leading to eight being judged outstanding, 11 good and one requires improvement.“Our staff go and work in some of the toughest schools in the country to support and care for children, and our schools have never been more popular with parents, with many currently full and being asked by local authorities to admit over their capacity.”Dan Rosenberg from the education team at Simpson Millar, the law firm bringing the action, said large numbers of children were having their education blighted by the increasingly widespread and extended use of these isolation units.“We have grave concerns that the students involved are missing large amounts of education, and that there is a lack of procedural safeguards and review mechanisms, as well as a lack of monitoring of the use of the sanction by central government,” he said.A Department for Education spokesperson said behavioural policy was a matter for schools to decide, as long as it was lawful. “If a school chooses to use isolation rooms, pupils’ time in isolation should be no longer than necessary and the time used constructively,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30fe40695df36c256d8b271dd982e3b89ac505c/0_359_5381_3228/master/5381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4f663aa28a81866c4994f8e939c649","title":"use of fish discard exemptions by eu trawlers soars before ban","story":"The group wants to see more selective fishing gear used to cut discards, along with more remote electronic monitoring of the seas.The landing obligation is part of a wider reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) coming into force by 2020 that will set maximum sustainable yields for all fish stocks, and other environmental goals.So far, only one of the reformed policy’s 46 measures has been universally applied: the establishment of an administrative system for registering fishing vessels.Samantha Burgess, the WWF report’s author, said: “EU member states have had ample time to implement the provisions of the reformed CFP but have demonstrated an unacceptable lack of political will towards sustainable fisheries management.“This destructive trend must urgently be reversed, especially in coastal communities where fisheries contribute to community livelihoods and food security.”A European commission spokesman said the study showed the EU’s approach to sustainability was making progress “but there is still more work to do”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749df71f2f36fa864ab8da4bb04bf46018e35920/0_300_6266_3760/master/6266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc6307e00703d14de7dc6b2b84f256f","title":"we could smell the boat approaching grim truth animal exports israel haifa","story":"Broken bones and other injuries are common for sheep and cattle held on ships for weeks in cramped pens. Photojournalist  Jo-Anne McArthur tracked the 22,000 arrivals on one boat in Israel’s Haifa portHundreds of thousands of live animals are transported each year on ships from Australia and Europe to the Middle East. The route from Australia to Israel is particularly long – the journey is three weeks at sea, where cattle and sheep are often kept in cramped pens for the duration.It’s estimated this year Israel will import 114,040 animals (cattle and sheep) from Australia, and 409,123 sheep and 169,991 cattle from Europe. Though these figures are lower than the previous year, in general live imports have been on the rise. Israel is expected to import 700,000 live animals this year – up from 200,000 in 2012.In July, I went to Israel to photograph the Australian ships coming into port in Haifa. One of the boats, the Bahijah, was carrying an estimated 22,000 animals.I spent a week monitoring the ships at port, waiting for news of one of the live imports. When we heard the Bahijah was coming in, we managed to rent a yacht that morning and meet the ship at sea. I was able to photograph the ship and the animals from a distance.The ship completely dwarfed us. I was struck by the smell. Even from further away we could smell the boat approaching. At almost every window you could see animals crowded together. The ones at the windows are lucky because they’re getting fresh air.The movement from the sea is really unsteady, and the animals are not used to that: in some cases they suffer injuries and broken bones. In April, a whistleblower employed on a live export ship worked with Animals Australia to reveal the situation on board a vessel. Footage from five shipments from Australia to the Middle East appeared to show sheep covered in faeces and severely decomposed bodies left in pens with living sheep. In one particular journey, more than 880 animals died during the course of the voyage.The story doesn’t end when the ships arrive at port.From here, the animals are unloaded on to trucks. This can take up to 12 and even 16 hours because there are thousands of animals on board.The cattle and sheep are then transported cross-country. I trailed trucks for hours to feedlots near Eilat, and to quarantine in a settlement in the West Bank. The feedlots were dusty and crowded. The animals in quarantine were lethargic.Dead farm animals are routinely washing up on Tel Avivian public beaches. Due to the distressing conditions animals are in, many don’t survive the journey at sea and it’s believed their corpses are just thrown overboard. The washed-up animals often have the ears or heads missing, so their ear tags can’t be traced to identify the ships.The dead and dying in feedlots are also often disposed in the desert. I witnessed football field-sized parcels of land with mounds of manure and decomposing animal bodies that must have been there for decades. The images can’t convey the stench, or the flies. The future of the controversial live imports trade is uncertain. A bill has been proposed in the Israeli Knesset to phase out live imports of animals from Australia and Europe for slaughter because of the suffering it causes the animals. The bill would reduce the transportation of live animals while increasing tax-free imports of fresh meat, and encourage local production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7224c165d38522e23b2304e5e5c14375eef3782f/0_243_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6bdae75cad7852f079cc238eb501d60","title":"thomasina miers alternative christmas canape indian spiced sausage rolls recipe","story":"These curry-spiced sausage rolls could grace the Christmas table instead of pigs in blankets, or as canapes for partiesOver Christmas, we usually try to throw a lunch party (isn’t seeing the people we love the stuff of life?) and we often visit the Indian sub-continent for inspiration, with my father such an avid fan of Madhur Jaffrey.

In a small pan, warm the oil over a medium heat and fry the onion for seven or eight minutes, until soft.Meanwhile, gently toast the cumin, coriander and fenugreek seeds in a small, dry frying pan over a medium heat for a minute or two, until they smell fragrant, then grind in a mortar or spice grinder. Add the garlic, ginger and all the spices to the onions, and saute for four to five minutes more to soften the garlic and ginger.Finally, stir in the tomato puree, remove from the heat, season well and turn the mixture out on to a plate to cool. If you are going to cook the sausage rolls right away, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4.Once the onion mix is cool, stir in the sausagemeat and breadcrumbs. Fry a little of the mixture in a pan to check the seasoning – you may want to add a pinch more salt. Now remove the pastry from the fridge, put on a floured surface and cut in half lengthways. Divide the sausagemeat in half and roll into two long sausages. Put a sausage along the length of each pastry and brush the long edges with egg wash. Roll the pastries around the meat and press the pastry together where it meets, using a fork to crimp the edges. Brush all over with egg wash, sprinkle with fennel seeds and cut into mini rolls about the thickness of a walnut – any thinner and they will fall over in the oven. At this stage, you can freeze them, separating the layers with parchment paper.Bake for 20-25 minutes, until puffed and golden, and serve with red onion marmalade, chutney or simply by themselves.You can double the quantity of the sausage filling to make meatballs – delicious with a simple ginger- and garlic-scented tomato sauce. This is an option for coeliacs if you omit the breadcrumbs from the filling. Buy extra pastry to freeze – always handy for whipping up a quick tart or makeshift pizza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245f1c846b292b6dcf1de023db4d19e0e74104fd/0_3553_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8cc49cfbe8fe6540b14e002668d06d8","title":"christmas party recipe nigel slater rachel roddy partridge pie panelle scratchings","story":"From crowd-pleasing snacks of posh crackling and chickpea fritters to Nigel Slater’s partridge pie, here is our second selection of the best recipes to celebrate ChristmasServes 12apples 500g, Cox or Braeburn preferred, peeledmincemeat 500gFor the pastrygood plain flour 250g, siftedunsalted butter 130gcaster sugar 15gice-cold water 3 tbspegg yolk 1For the frangipaneunsalted butter 50ggolden caster sugar 25gwhole peeled almonds 50g, ground quite fineegg 1 mediumFor the meringueegg whites 4 largecaster sugar 250gTo make the pastry, work the flour and butter together until a fine crumb forms.

The procedure may sound bizarre or difficult, but I assure you it is neither. Serves 6-8 as an antipasticold water 1 litrechickpea flour 300g olive oil for fryingsalt a big pinchlemon wedges to serveIn a large pan, whisk the cold water and the chickpea flour until it forms a smooth batter with no lumps. Tip the batter into a large, heavy-based pan over a medium-low heat and whisk steadily.After 10 minutes or so, the batter will start thickening and now you really need to whisk to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom. Once the mixture is coming away cleanly from the sides of the pan, it is ready.Now, moving swiftly, use a spatula to smear the batter on to a clean marble surface, a large flat tin, or plates. The layer should be 3-5mm thick. Let the mixture cool completely. If you have spread it on to a work surface or tin, it can be cut into squares where it is. If you have smeared it on to plates, peel off the layer of batter carefully and cut each one into slim wedges.In a pan or deep frying pan, heat the oil to frying temperature, which is 180C, or when a cube of bread dances on the surface of the oil and turns golden after 20 seconds. Fry the panelle in small batches until they are crisp and golden. Lift from the oil with a slotted spoon on to kitchen paper to drain briefly, then transfer to a serving plate. Sprinkle with salt and serve straightaway, with lemon wedges.From Two Kitchens by Rachel Roddy, (Headline Home, £26)You will need a loose 24cm round tart tin base to cook the pie.Serves 6partridges 3bay leaves 3onion 1 smallred onions 2carrots 3 mediumcelery 2 ribsolive oil 6 tbspbutter 20gsmoked streaky bacon 8 rashersthyme 8 sprigsrosemary 2 busy sprigsgarlic 2 clovesherby butcher’s sausages 8ground allspice ½ tspground cinnamon ½ tspground mace ½ tsppuff pastry 500geggs 2For the sauceclementine or small orange 1dried cranberries 50gdry marsala 150mlredcurrant jelly 4 tbspPut the partridges into a deep saucepan then pour over enough cold water to cover the birds. Bring to the boil with the bay leaves and the small onion. Lower the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid, and let the partridges cook for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the red onions, finely chop the carrots and cut the celery into small slices. Warm the olive oil and butter in a large, deep pan, stir in the red onion, carrot and celery and cook for 5 minutes until the onion is translucent. Roughly chop the bacon and stir into the vegetables.Pull the leaves from the thyme sprigs and the needles from the rosemary. Chop the rosemary finely. Peel and finely crush the garlic then stir, together with the herbs, into the vegetables.Remove the skins from the sausages then put the sausage meat into a large mixing bowl. Add the ground allspice, cinnamon and mace and season with salt and black pepper.Remove the birds from their cooking liquor, let them cool briefly then remove the breast meat from the bones. It should come away easily. If not, slice it off the bones with a kitchen knife. Retain the remaining meat, bones and cooking liquor for stock.Stir the softened onion and bacon mixture into the seasoned sausage meat, mixing thoroughly. I tend to use my hands here.Cut off one third of the puff pastry and roll it to fit the base of a round 24cm tart tin with a little extra overlapping the edge. You can trim this later. Pile half the sausage and herb stuffing on top of the pastry, leaving 2cm or so of bare pastry around the edge. Smooth the surface level and place the 6 partridge breasts on top then add the remaining mixture, smoothing the top into a dome.Roll out the second piece of puff pastry to fit plentifully over the meat. Beat the eggs in a small bowl then brush the edge of the bottom layer of pastry generously. Lower the second piece over the top then trim any overhanging pastry with a knife. Press firmly and pinch the edges to seal. Brush with beaten egg.Use pastry trimmings to make leaves or holly berries with which to decorate your pie then press them into place. Brush with more beaten egg and rest the pie in the fridge for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6, placing a baking sheet in the oven to get hot. Carefully put the chilled pie, on its tart-tin base, on top of the hot baking sheet and bake for about 50 minutes till golden. Let the pie rest for 10 minutes before serving.While the pie bakes, prepare the sauce. Cut the clementine in half and squeeze the juice into a saucepan. Remove and discard the flesh then cut the peel into very fine strips, as thin as you can. Add these to the juice, then stir in the cranberries, marsala and jelly. Bring to the boil, immediately lower the heat then serve with the rested pie.Nigel Slater is the Observer’s food writerI love the combination of hot charred bread and aniseed butter with the rich, smoky, whipped cod roe.

It is important to scrape all the smoked roe from within the lobe, not wasting any. Use a kitchen spoon to do this it may take some time, but it’s worth it.Add the roe to a mixing bowl with the egg yolk, lemon juice and 10g of salt and begin to whisk slowly. Once the ingredients are mixed, add the oil gradually while continuing to whisk to emulsify (as you would with mayonnaise). Stop when you have 100ml of oil to go. Now add the water – this will lighten the mix and alter the colour. Whisk in the remaining oil and salt. The mix should be nice and moussey. Transfer into a piping bag and make a 1.5cm cut at the end, or use equivalent nozzle.For the fennel butter, sweat the fennel in the oil, until soft. Add the fennel seeds and chilli and cook for 1 minute. Add the Pernod and cook on full heat for another minute. Now add the water. When the fennel mixture is boiling, gradually add the cold butter. Add the salt, then cool a little and strain.To assemble, toast the bread – ideally on a charcoal grill, but a domestic grill will work or on top of a toaster. Once toasted, brush liberally with the fennel butter. Pipe or spoon on the whipped roe.

My mum is Chinese, and Christmas isn’t really a big deal for her, so after my parents separated, we didn’t celebrate it much. Then, in the years when I was a care assistant, or a support worker in a hospital, I have had to work. The only things I do every year are a secret Santa with my friends – and baking.One year, I went on a baking marathon. I got it into my head that I wanted to make loads of things and photograph them all in one picture. I baked mince pies, and camembert with bread around the edge. My partner, Nabil, wanted to eat it straight away, but I had to take it outside and hold it over a hedge to photograph it. I also made little cupcakes with my own Santa Claus toppers. I love baking anything with the flavours of cinnamon, cardamom and gingerbread – such as the bauble biscuits and cake. I really associate those warming spices with Christmas. Even though I didn’t grow up with them, they feel emotionally resonant without being tied to any specific memory. I have an image in mind of sitting at home with a spiced drink.Christmas now means spending quality time with Nabil. That is what I am looking forward to this year. As well as the recipes I am sharing here, I am planning to make little meringue snowmen with different characters, telling a story. I would love to do an edible snowy scene. And do the camembert bake again – but this time with little cats embedded in the dough. Christmas cats, in Christmas hats ...I am looking forward to hanging out at home, having a relaxing time and eating. Mostly the eating.Not only do these cute snowmen truffles melt in the mouth (there will be no frostbite here), they are also fun to decorate and kids will love getting involved. They make a charming gift for friends and family – just package them in a box and make sure the lucky recipient eats them straight away They can be stored in the fridge for up to a week.Prep time: 2hr 30mins (including 2hr of chilling time)For the truffles: 300g good quality white chocolate25g butter140g double cream 1 tbsp orange liqueur and orange flavour extract (optional)For the marzipan: (alternatively use shop-bought marzipan, or shop-bought sugar paste, but homemade marzipan is the tastiest)125g icing sugar125g very finely ground almonds40g egg white¼ tsp almond extract¾ tsp armagnacPlus: 200g fine dessicated coconut, edible pearl sprinkles, dyed marzipan or sugar paste colours: orange, blue, pink (or any other colours you prefer to use).Chop the chocolate and butter into small pieces and place in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a pan until it just starts to bubble, then pour over the chocolate and butter. Leave for two minutes, then stir until smooth. Cover with clingfilm (touching the surface of the ganache), and put in the fridge to chill for an hour.When the ganache is cool, transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment fitted. If using the orange liqueur and flavour extract, add (to taste) at this point. Whisk until fluffy and lighter in colour. Transfer to a shallow tray, cover with cling film, and transfer to the freezer to chill for about an hour again.The ganache should now be very firm, such that you can mould it into balls. Shape 10 larger truffles between your palms, and roll in fine dessicated coconut. Then shape a further 10 smaller truffles in the same way. Stack the smaller truffles on top of the larger, so that it is starting to look like a snowman. Leave in the fridge to firm up again.If making your own marzipan, combine the icing sugar and ground almonds. Then add the rest of the ingredients. Mix and form into a ball. Use food dye to colour the marzipan as desired.Shape fondant or marzipan to create colourful hats and scarves for the snowmen. Give them carrot noses made of fondantmarzipan. Use edible pearl sprinkles for buttons, and use small black sprinkles for their eyes (or poppy seeds, if you have them, but this is a little fiddly).Leave to chill in the fridge until just before you are ready to serve.It takes times to get the hang of piping with royal icing, but once you have it, these Christmas baubles are very relaxing to make. They are also very rewarding, because you can hang them on your Christmas tree and show them off to friends and family. Who needs to buy decorations when you can make delicious edible ones? Yes, I hear you, after all your hard work decorating, you may find these too santa-mental to eat ... but they taste so good, you might just end up eating them AND your words. When you get more confident, play about with patterns and colours to create your own designs. There are endless combinations you can try.Makes: about 20 small Christmas baubles as pictured, or 12 larger onesDecorating time: depends on how many biscuits you are decorating and to what level of detail.For the biscuits:150g salted butter (or use unsalted and add salt to taste) 100g dark muscovado sugar 25g liquid molasses2 tbsp beaten egg1 tbsp ground ginger¾ tbsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground cloves 225g plain flour, plus extra to dust and roll out For the royal icing:400g icing sugar2 medium egg whites (you can use 70g pasteurised egg whites from a carton if you are concerned about using raw egg whites)Red, blue and green food dyesGold and silver edible paint(Plus extra icing sugar andor egg white)Red and green gel or powder food dyesPreheat oven to 200C180C fangas mark 6. Add the butter, sugar and molasses to the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk on high speed, until smooth and creamy. You can, of course, do this by hand.Add the beaten egg and ground spices. Mix until just combined.Add the flour and combine using your hands until the mixture forms a ball. Turn out on to a well-floured surface, and roll out to the thickness of a pound coin.Use christmas bauble cutters to stamp out desired biscuit shapes, then transfer these on to a baking tray lined with baking paper or a silicon mat. Alternatively, make your own bauble templates out of card, place the card on top of the biscuit dough as a guide to cut out the shape using a small, sharp knife (the biscuits pictured were made using cardboard templates as a guide). Use a toothpick or similar item to make holes at the top of each biscuit bauble.Chill the biscuits for 10 minutes, then bake for 10-12 minutes, or until they just start colouring at the edges. Leave to cool on wire rack.Meanwhile, make the royal icing. Add the icing sugar and egg white to the bowl of a stand mixer, then mix using the whisk or paddle attachment, until smooth and glossy. The consistency you are aiming for is one that returns to a smooth surface about 15-20 seconds after running a knife through it. You can use additional icing sugar and egg white to adjust the consistency accordingly.Divide the royal icing between three bowls. Leave one white, and dye the icing in the remaining two bowls. You can use any colours you like, but red and green are ideal for Christmas.Divide the white icing between two disposable piping bags. Repeat with the red and the green. You will now have six piping bags, two of each colour. For each colour, snip a very small opening in one piping bag (this will be for outlining), and a slightly larger opening in the other (this will be for flooding).When the biscuits are cool, they are ready to decorate. Outline four biscuits with white icing, four with red and four with green. Make sure to define an outline for the goldsilver attachment at the top of the bauble (see main picture). To achieve neat lines, try to lift and guide the icing into place rather than dragging the piping bag along the biscuit.Now that the edges are outlined, you can flood the biscuits with their corresponding colour without the icing dripping over the edges. Flood using the piping bag with the larger cut tip, and use a toothpick or similar item to even out the icing and get rid of any air bubbles. If you have the correct consistency, your icing should smooth itself out.Leave for at least an hour for the surface of the icing to harden, before adding the details and painting with silver and gold. It will take four-five hours to completely harden, so make sure you are careful so as not to crack the surface.Use the fine tipped piping bags to add the details, using the examples here as a guide. When the icing has hardened, paint details gold and silver.Tie the baubles with nice ribbon or string, and hang on your tree.This lighter fruit cake is perfect for guests who aren’t so keen on heavier varieties. It is still delightfully indulgent and has Christmas written all over it. I find that guests love the playful penguins and enjoy identifying which one is most like them, and then inventing stories around them. This cake should keep for at least a week, but not as long as a heavy Christmas cake would do. But could you really wait much longer to eat this?Prep time: The cake with full decoration will take two days, as the marzipan and icing trees need time to harden. The penguins also take some time to make.For the cake: 250g salted butter250g light brown muscovado250g eggs (about 4 large eggs) 250g self raising flourGrated rind of 1 orange and 1 lemon2½ tbsp ground cinnamon1½ tbsp ground ginger¼ tsp cloves480g mixed dried fruitFor the whisky syrup:90g caster sugar20g hot water50g whiskyFor the marzipan: (or buy a 500g packet of marzipan, you will have some leftover)250g very finely ground almonds250g icing sugar80g egg whites⅓ tsp almond extract1½ tsp armagnacFor the royal icing: 700g icing sugar2 egg whites1 tsp of glycerin (optional)Plus: green food dye sprinkles black, white, orange and blue sugarpaste.To make the cake:Preheat the oven to 160C140C fangas mark 3. Grease an 18cm and a 15cm cake tin. Line the bases with greaseproof paper.Add the butter and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer, with either whisk or paddle attachment, then cream together until fluffy and lightened in colour. This can be done by hand.In a separate bowl, use a fork to lightly whisk the eggs. Slowly add a tablespoon at a time to the sugarbutter mixture, mixing well after each addition.Sift in the self raising flour and ground spices. Add the grated rind. Whisk until just combined.Add the mixed fruit, using a spatula to gently fold in.Divide the mixture between the two pre-prepared cake tins.Bake for about 90 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the centre comes out clean.Leave the cakes to cool in their tins for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make the whisky syrup. Add the sugar and water to a pan and heat until all the sugar has dissolved. Add the whisky and mix.After the cakes have cooled in their tins for 10 minutes, run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen and flip on to a cooling rack and remove the baking paper from the bottom.Use a skewer, chopstick or similar tool to poke holes all over the surface of the cakes. Soak with 13 of the whisky syrup. Turn the cakes over and repeat with the other side. Reserve the rest of the whisky syrup for soaking the cakes later.Leave the cakes to completely cool before assembling.To make the marzipanMix the icing sugar and ground almonds in a large bowl. Add the egg white, almond extract and armagnac and mix to form a ball. Wrap in clingfilm and place in the fridge until ready to use.To make the royal icingAdd the icing sugar, egg white and glycerin (optional – this prevents the royal icing setting rock hard) to the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk until combined and smooth. The royal icing should be glossy and thick enough to hold peaks, but not so thick that you can’t spread it easily. If not using immediately, cover with clingfilm (making sure the clingfilm touches the surface of the icing).To make the treesTo make the penguins:Roll one larger black ball of sugar paste to form the torso, and then a smaller black ball to form the head. Roll out white sugar paste and trim to create the detailing for the torso and head. Roll out black sugar paste and use a pizza wheel to create the penguins arms. Roll out blue sugar paste and use the pizza wheel again to craft a scarf or hat for the penguins. Use orange sugar paste for their noses, and the black sugar paste for the eyes. A toothpick is useful to help you to secure the eyes and nose. Use sprinkles to add areas of interest, eg as baubles on top of their hats. Try to create penguins of various sizes with different personalities to tell a story.To assemble the cake:When the cake is fully cooled, stack the smaller cake centre-back on top of the larger cake. Place the cakes on top of a large cake board. Then carve a dip in the cakes where the slide for the penguins will be. Soak the exposed cake again with the remaining whisky syrup.Dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the marzipan to just less than the thickness of a pound coin. Lift and drape the marzipan to cover the entire cake. Trim the bottom edges. It doesn’t matter if this is somewhat messy as you will cover it with royal icing later.Leave the marzipan for eight hours or overnight until it has hardened.While you are waiting for the marzipan to harden, you can create the royal icing trees and then make the sugar paste penguins (see instructions for both above).Use a tablespoon to spread the royal icing over the marzipan, creating peaks of snow for effect. Use a few drops of water and a finger to smooth the icing where the slide will be.Arrange sugar-paste penguins and trees as desired. Finish by sieving over a dusting of icing sugar.

As each fritter is ready, remove with a draining spoon and rest on kitchen paper. Continue until you have 9 fritters. Serve hot. Serves 3.Get the oil to the right temperature before lowering in the squash. It should measure 180C on a kitchen thermometer. If you don’t have one, drop a cube of bread into the oil. It should sizzle instantly and turn pale gold in a minute or two. If the bread doesn’t fizz as soon as you add it, the oil is not hot enough.You could use marrow or courgettes in place of the butternut. The courgette will work deliciously with feta and thyme.

Our mistake. The words peppered Jürgen Klopp’s Napoli press conference, leaving no doubt that blame for Liverpool’s Champions League predicament rests on their doorstep. Opportunity for salvation resides there too. Anfield knows the script so well. “I know it will be difficult,” their manager said, “but I can not help think about it without a smile on my face.”Liverpool have backed themselves into a corner in Europe once again as a consequence of losing three away games in a group for the first time. Carlo Ancelotti, the Napoli and former Milan manager, needs no schooling on his opponents’ powers of recovery. A 1-0 win or victory by two goals at Anfield will guarantee Liverpool qualification for the knockout phase. Defeat to an Italian club that has never won in England, combined with a loss for Paris Saint-Germain at Red Star Belgrade, and the new Premier League leaders will be out of European competition completely nine months after reaching the Champions League final. Their manager sees only an opportunity to rectify a campaign of contrasts.“We are in a good moment for weeks and months as a club and a team, we have to use it,” Klopp said. “One of the most difficult teams to play at this moment is Napoli. They were already really strong last year and have adapted really well to the little changes Carlo Ancelotti made. They are a really good side but we are as well.“The competition is like this. You play the strongest teams and if you want to go through you have to win. We didn’t win often enough to be through already. That is our mistake and now we can put it right if we perform. We all know the results we need and it is quite difficult. Napoli are good in possession, counterattack as well, typical Italian team good at defending. It’s a big challenge but if something special is possible it is here and that is why we should try.”Liverpool have reserved their poorest performances – their only poor performances of the season so far – for their European travels, with the 90th-minute 1-0 defeat in Naples setting the tone. Away from home Klopp’s team produced a total of five shots on target in three matches, including James Milner’s penalty in Paris, whereas two matches at Anfield have yielded seven goals and maximum points. Liverpool are unbeaten in 18 European home games since Real Madrid’s visit in October 2014.“The first game against Napoli was that bad from our side that we can improve everything,” Klopp said. “We didn’t defend for a second like we wanted and we didn’t play like we wanted to play with the ball. But that was six weeks ago. No team in the world are perfect. We are not and Napoli are not. We all have weaknesses.Anfield is not the only foundation for Klopp’s confidence. His team could not have timed better their move to the top at Manchester City’s expense, certainly not in terms of preparation for Napoli, while another clean sheet at Bournemouth, Mohamed Salah’s hat-trick and the increased involvement of Naby Keïta plus Fabinho in midfield adds to a sense of growing momentum.The pursuit of a first league championship since 1990 may be assisted by an early exit from the Champions League, it has been suggested by Gary Neville and others, but Virgil van Dijk gave that idea short shrift.“I don’t think they are Liverpool fans,” said the central defender. “We want to compete on the highest level. We are top of the league now but it could change next week. You never know. The main thing is to stay at the highest level and to do everything we can to go through. It is going to be a tough game but I am very confident, like always in my team.“We need to start like we always start at home in the Champions League. We wanted to do that away too but it is not as easy as people might think. We need to start fast, set the tone, put them under pressure and play our game. Be brave, be confident and don’t hide. Show yourself.”Van Dijk has refused to contemplate the possibility of dropping into the Europa League “or worse” after Tuesday’s game. His manager does not believe Champions League elimination, should it come to pass, will have a lasting or detrimental effect on Liverpool’s prospects of pushing City all the way in the league.Klopp said: “It is a different competition. If we are not a Champions League club in JanuaryFebruary it will not be one second an excuse for anything else. We do not need to make this game any bigger than it is but it is big. That is exactly how we want to make it. As an opportunity for us. Stay in the competition. The boys, I know, are desperate to stay in the competition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d827209f8486c033b135f5840b1ff8a6a0a203/0_50_2686_1611/master/2686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ea44914b0a75bbbdfb4aa402530b8db","title":"racism in football raheem sterling manchester city chelsea","story":"After a troubling week with two high-profile incidents in the Premier League, we want to hear from fansRaheem Sterling says sections of the media “fuel racism” in football after being the subject of alleged racist abuse during a Premier League match on Saturday.

Barcelona. We may be fast approaching yuletide, the season of half-baked one-liners, dodgy dad jokes and tacky gadgets funnelling out of Christmas crackers, but the size of the task facing Tottenham Hotspur who visit Catalonia on Tuesday night is no laughing matter.The reality is they have to win, or at least match, Internazionale’s result against bottom-of-the-group PSV Eindhoven to guarantee qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League. Saying that, Mauricio Pochettino’s side probably do not know whether to laugh or cry given Barça’s imperious formperformance at the Camp Nou.Guardiola lost seven matches at the Camp Nou in four years, while Luis Enrique lost five in three. Some quick maths underlines the difficulty of the challenge in store, with Barça having lost an average of 1.45 games per campaign across the past 10 seasons, from 2008-9 until 2017-18.Unfortunately for Tottenham, it is impossible to lose 0.45 of a game and the bad news is that Barça have already lost once this year, against Real Betis last month. But the good news, if there is any at all, is the slither of scope for possibly one more unprecedented slip-up. As the saying goes, it is the hope that kills you.Barcelona, of course, are already through, having already walked Group B. After Spurs gave themselves a fighting chance against Inter, Pochettino, as you would expect, was reluctant to cast this test as mission impossible, though it is everything but. Barcelona have bullied and belittled countless teams on their patch, with English sides among those to suffer in recent years. Their last three games at home to English clubs have resulted in an aggregate score of 10-1 in their favour, 3-0, 4-0 and 3-1 wins against Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal respectively. Liverpool were the last English team to win at the Camp Nou, in the Champions League last-16 in 2007.Spurs are not naive enough to expect gifts, but with Barcelona having already qualified, their motivation will naturally come under scrutiny. It is just as well then that Pochettino wrapped Harry Kane, his captain, and Christian Eriksen in cotton wool for Saturday’s cruise at Leicester even then, you cannot help but feel it may not be enough to nark a beast like Barça."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d6d03365928b8876be32504201d65bef70593fd/12_261_4899_2939/master/4899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=740ff1be623977d7ede1afaf2d5f8e7f","title":"sponsorship uefa womens football business","story":"Sponsorship deals are routinely mocked, from Manchester United’s mattress partners to Everton’s Angry Birds sleeves, with some companies all too keen to get themselves associated with Premier League clubs. And we roll our eyes at the latest madcap scenarios players find themselves in at launch events.However Uefa’s announcement that it has agreed a seven-year deal with Visa as the first sponsor of Uefa women’s football deserves the celebratory tone with which it was unveiled. Because, for a change, it actually is a groundbreaking deal. Why? Because as Nadine Kessler, Uefa’s head of women’s football, said, the aim is “to assign a clear value to women’s football”.“At the end of the day it’s not about the monetary value, it’s more about showing people this game has value,” she says. “This is the message we try to send out.”One of the most common criticisms levelled at women’s football is that it is unable to stand on its own feet. There are many reasons why this is a red herring: historic bans on women’s football in a number of countries, attitudes towards women and sport, attitudes towards women in society generally and how girls build relationships with their bodies from early on are all matters that need to be taken into account. But more simply, aside from why it is so far behind the men’s game, the women’s game has every chance of becoming self-sustaining.This deal is the biggest sign of that potential to date and it will also accelerate growth. Unbundling the rights to women’s football from the men’s for the first time means the Uefa will be able to measure the worth and growth of the game in its own right like never before. Under the new partnership all levels of the women’s game, from grassroots to the Women’s Champions League, will be backed.This uncoupling isn’t just financial: Uefa had already separated the Women’s Champions League final from the men’s for the first time. “These are two projects which have a similar meaning and background,” Kessler says.“It is great to be a part of the Champions League week, in the same town, etc. The attention is massive – the whole world is already there, it has its benefits. But again, how can you say just how many people came for the women’s, how much attention we created and whether we gave women’s football a moment of its own? We hope this will be further evidence of the fact women’s football should have a platform of its own and is capable of using this platform.”The development of women’s football is uneven. A kind of antithesis of Uefa’s impressive news were the images of the women’s Copa Libertadores winners Atlético Huila apparently sleeping on the floor of an airport on their way home from the final. The South American Football Confederation’s commitment to women’s football is clearly not in the same place as Uefa’s. But what Uefa’s new deal does is go beyond showing doubters among the public that women’s football has value it also shows those in power within football that it has value, for their image, for their growth as an organisation, and financially.Kessler hopes that it does inspire to that extent. “It is not just Europe, it is not just Uefa – that is always the message I am trying to spread,” she says. “We need to really try to improve things together at the same time, from a confederations point of view, from a national associations point of view, even from a clubs point of view.“The conditions, the stages of development, are still so vast. We have different stages of development within Europe itself but then compared to many parts of the world we are quite privileged.”Big business does not do things out of the kindness of its heart. Companies get on board when they see a wave worth riding, when there is benefit to their organisation. Women’s football has something to offer, now it faces more ethical and political questions around sponsorship, such as who it partners with.• Following the draw on Saturday, presales for the Women’s World Cup opened on Monday and close on 23 December.

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

A May rate hike, after a no-deal Brexit likely has been averted, remains a good bet,” he said.Alok Sharma, the employment minister, said the statistics showed “the enduring strength of our jobs market” with employment at a record high.“This is benefiting people across the country, with almost 400,000 more people in work in the last year. Putting more money in the pockets of working families, and showing the UK remains a great place to invest and do business,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f02dc5a0f2b99cfd08c40be3df0e7fe0cf7d193d/135_871_1502_901/master/1502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed0304c1da05f636a4e14fc4babdef16","title":"mysterious allergy to meat alpha gal lone star tick","story":"Thousands of people are developing life-threatening reactions to animal products – and a single tiny creature is to blame. It was early morning in early summer, and I was tracing my way through the woods of central North Carolina, steering cautiously around S-curves and braking hard when what looked like a small rise turned into a narrow bridge. I was on my way to meet Tami McGraw, who lives with her husband and the youngest of their kids in a sprawling development of old trees and wide lawns just south of Chapel Hill. Before I reached her, McGraw emailed. She wanted to feed me when I got there.“Would you like to try emu?” she asked. “Or perhaps some duck?”These are not normal breakfast offerings. But for years, nothing about McGraw’s life has been normal. She cannot eat beef or pork, or drink milk or eat cheese or snack on a gelatine-containing dessert without feeling her throat close and her blood pressure drop. Wearing a wool sweater raises hives on her skin inhaling the fumes of bacon sizzling on a stove will knock her to the ground. Everywhere she goes, she carries an array of tablets that can beat back an allergy attack, and an auto-injecting EpiPen that can jolt her system out of anaphylactic shock.McGraw is allergic to the meat of mammals and everything else that comes from them: dairy products, wool and fibre, gelatine from their hooves, char from their bones. This syndrome affects thousands of people in the US and an uncertain but likely larger number worldwide, and after a decade of research, scientists have begun to understand what causes it. It is created by the bite of a tick, picked up on a hike or brushed against in a garden, or hitchhiking on the fur of a pet that was roaming outside.The illness, which generally goes by the name “alpha-gal allergy” after the component of meat that triggers it, is a trial that McGraw and her family are still learning to cope with. In much the same way, medicine is grappling with it, too. Allergies occur when our immune systems perceive something that ought to be familiar as foreign. For scientists, alpha-gal is forcing a remapping of basic tenets of immunology: how allergies occur, how they are triggered, whom they put in danger and when.For those affected, alpha-gal is transforming the landscapes they live in, turning the reliable comforts of home – the plants in their gardens, the food on their plates – into an uncertain terrain of risk.In 1987, Dr Sheryl van Nunen was confronted with a puzzle. She was the head of the allergy department at a regional hospital in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, and had a reputation among her colleagues for sorting out mysterious episodes of anaphylaxis. This time, a man had been sent to see her who kept waking up, in the middle of the night, in the grip of some profound reaction.Van Nunen knew at once that this was out of the ordinary, since most allergic reactions happen soon after exposure, rather than hours later. She also knew that only a few allergens affect people after they have gone to bed. (Latex, for instance – someone sensitive to it who has sex using a latex condom might fall asleep and wake up in the midst of an allergy attack.) She checked the man for the obvious irritants and, when those tests came up negative, took a thorough look at his medical history and did a skin test for everything he had eaten and touched in the hours before bedtime. The only potential allergen that returned a positive result was meat.This was weird (and dismaying, in barbecue-loving Australia). But it was the only such case Van Nunen had ever seen. She coached the patient on how to avoid the meals that seemed to be triggering his reactions, put it down to the unpredictability of the human immune system, and moved on.Then a few more such patients came her way. There were six others during the 1990s by 2003, she had seen at least 70, all with the same problem, all apparently affected by meat they had eaten a few hours before. Groping for an explanation, she lengthened the list of questions she asked, quizzing the patients about whether they or their families had ever reacted to anything else: detergents, fabrics, plants in their gardens, insects on the plants.“And invariably, these people would say to me: ‘I haven’t been bitten by a bee or a wasp, but I’ve had lots of tick bites,’” Van Nunen recalls.As she remembers it, Tami McGraw’s symptoms began after 2010. That was the year she and her husband, Tom, a retired surgeon, spied a housing bargain in North Carolina, a development next to a nature reserve whose builder had priced the big houses to sell. The leafy spread of streams and woodland pockets was everything she wanted in a home. She didn’t realise that it offered everything that deer and birds and rodents – the main hosts of ticks – want as well.She remembers one tick that attached to her scalp, raising such a welt that the spot was red for months afterwards, and a swarm of baby ticks that climbed her legs and had to be scrubbed off in a hot bath laced with bleach. Unpredictably, at odd intervals, she began to feel dizzy and sick.“I’d have unexplained allergic reactions, and I’d break out in hives and my blood pressure would go crazy,” she told me. The necklines of all her T-shirts were stretched, because she tugged at them to relieve the feeling that she couldn’t take a deep breath. She trekked to an array of doctors who diagnosed her with asthma or early menopause or a tumour on her pituitary gland. They prescribed antibiotics and inhalers and steroids. They sent her for MRI scans, pulmonary function tests, echocardiograms of her heart. Nothing yielded a result.Looking back, she realises she missed clues as to the source of her problem. She always seemed to need to use an asthma inhaler on Wednesdays – the day she spent hours in her car, delivering steaming-hot dinners for meals on wheels. She would feel short of breath, and need to visit an urgent-care clinic, on Saturdays – which always started, in her household, with a big breakfast of eggs and sausages.Then a close friend had a scary episode: after going for a run, she arrived home and passed out on the hot concrete of her driveway. Once the friend had recovered, McGraw quizzed her. Her friend said: “They thought I got stung by a bee while I was running. But now they think maybe I have a red-meat allergy.”McGraw remembers her first reaction: that’s crazy. But her second was: maybe I have that too. She did some searching online, and then asked her doctor to order a little-known blood test that would show if her immune system was reacting to a component of mammal meat. The test result was so strongly positive that her doctor called her at home to tell her to step away from the stove.The test launched her on an odyssey of discovering just how much mammal material is present in everyday life. One time, she took capsules of liquid painkiller and woke up in the middle of the night, itching and covered in hives provoked by the drug’s gelatine covering.When she bought an unfamiliar lip balm, the lanolin in it made her mouth peel and blister. She planned to spend an afternoon gardening, spreading fertiliser and planting flowers, but passed out on the grass and had to be revived with an EpiPen. She had reacted to manure and bone meal that had been added as enrichments to the bagged compost she had bought.She struggled with the attacks’ unpredictability, and even more with the impact on her family. “I think I’m getting better, and then I realise I’m not,” she says. “It’s just that I’m more knowledgable about what I can and can’t do.”The discovery of new diseases often follows a pattern. Scattered patients realise they are experiencing strange symptoms. They find each other, face to face in a neighbourhood or across the world on the internet. They bring their experience to medicine, and medicine is sceptical. And then, after a period of pain and recalcitrance, medicine admits that, in fact, the patients were right.That is the story of the discovery of CFSME and Lyme disease, among others. But it is not the story of alpha-gal allergy. An odd set of coincidences brought this bizarre illness to the attention of researchers almost as soon as it occurred.The story begins with a cancer drug called cetuximab, which came on to the market in 2004. Cetuximab is a protein grown in cells taken from mice. For any new drug, there are likely to be a few people that react badly to it, and that was true for cetuximab. In its earliest trials, one or two of every 100 cancer patients who had it infused into their veins had a hypersensitive reaction: their blood pressure dropped and they had difficulty breathing.The manufacturers, ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb, checked every obvious thing about the trial: the drug’s ingredients, the cleanliness of the manufacturing plants, even the practices at the medical centres where cetuximab had been administered. Nothing stood out. The most that researchers could guess at the time was that the recipients might have some kind of mouse allergy.Then the first coincidence occurred: a nurse whose husband worked at the Bentonville clinic mentioned the death to Dr Tina Hatley, an immunologist in private practice in Bentonville. Hatley had recently finished postgraduate training at the University of Virginia’s allergy centre, and she mentioned the death to her former supervisor, Dr Thomas Platts-Mills.The bad responses to the drug looked like allergic reactions, and they were common enough – and far enough from the manufacturer’s expectations – to be an intriguing research opportunity.Platts-Mills pulled together a team, looping in Hatley and several current research fellows as well. Fairly quickly, they discovered the source of the problem. People were reacting to the drug because they had a pre-existing sensitivity, indicated by a high level of antibodies (called immunoglobulin E, or IgE for short), to a sugar that is present in the muscles of most mammals, though not in humans or other primates. The name of the sugar was galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, known for short as alpha-gal.Alpha-gal is familiar to many scientists because it is responsible for an enduring disappointment: its tendency to trigger intense immune reactions is the reason that organs taken from animals have never successfully been transplanted into people. The puzzle was why the drug recipients were reacting to it. To have an allergic reaction, someone needs to have been primed with a prior exposure to a substance – but the trial recipients who reacted badly were all on their first dose of cetuximab.Team members scrutinised the patients and their families for anything that could explain the problem. The reactions appeared regional – patients in Arkansas and North Carolina and Tennessee experienced the hypersensitivity, but ones in Boston and northern California did not. They investigated parasites, moulds and diseases that occur only in pockets of the US such as rural Tennessee.The question then became: what in rural Tennessee could trigger a reaction like this? The answer arose from a second coincidence. Dr Jacob Hosen, a researcher in Platts-Mills’s lab, stumbled across a map drawn by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing the prevalence of an infection called Rocky Mountain spotted fever. It exactly overlapped the hot spots where the cetuximab reactions had occurred.Rocky Mountain spotted fever is transmitted by the bite of a tick: Amblyomma americanum, one of the most common ticks in the south-eastern US. It’s known as the lone star tick because of the blotch of white that appears on the back of the female’s body.The researchers wondered – if the mystery reactions shared a footprint with a disease, and ticks caused the disease, could ticks be linked to the reactions, too?It was an intriguing hypothesis, and was reinforced by a new set of patients who came trickling into Platts-Mills’s clinic at about the same time. They were all adults, and that was odd to start with, because allergies tend to show up in childhood. They had never had an allergic reaction before, but now they were experiencing allergy symptoms: swelling, hives and, in the worst cases, anaphylactic shock. They too had high levels of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal.Meat from mammals inevitably contains alpha-gal – so in already sensitised iniduals, eating meat may constitute a second exposure, in the same way infusing cetuximab had been.If tick bites had sensitised them, then the alpha-gal reaction might be a food allergy as well as a drug reaction. But the connection was speculative, and cementing cause and effect would take one final, extraordinary coincidence.As it happens, Platts-Mills likes to hike. One weekend he took off across the central Virginia hills, tramping through grassy underbrush. He came home five hours later, peeled off his boots and socks, and found that his legs and feet were speckled with tiny dots. They looked like ground pepper, but were dug into his skin – he had to use a dull knife to scrape them off – and they itched fiercely. He saved a few, and sent them to an entomologist. They were the larval form of lone star ticks.This, he realised, was an opportunity. When he returned to the lab, he had his team draw his blood and check his IgE levels. They were low to start with, and then week by week began to climb. Platts-Mills is British – his father was an MP – and in the midst of having his IgE tracked, he went to an event at the Royal Society of Medicine in London. “And at that point,” he says cheerfully, “I ate two lamb chops and drank two glasses of wine.”In the middle of the night, he woke up covered in hives.The lone star tick doesn’t receive much attention in the US. It’s the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, that has the dubious honour of being the most well-known, as it’s the carrier of Lyme disease, which causes an estimated 300,000 cases of illness in the US each year. The lone star tick doesn’t transmit Lyme disease, but is the vector for other serious illnesses, including Q fever, ehrlichiosis, Heartland virus, Bourbon virus and tularaemia, an infection so serious that the US government classifies the bacteria that cause it as a potential agent of bioterrorism.While Lyme clusters in the north-east and the northern midwest US, diseases carried by Amblyomma stretch from the coast of Maine to the tip of Florida, the Atlantic to the middle of Texas, and the southern shores of the Great Lakes all the way to the Mexican border. And that range appears to be expanding. “The northern edge of where these ticks are abundant is moving,” says Dr Richard Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, north of New York City. “It is now well-established further north, into Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York and well up into New England.“Climate change is likely playing a role in the northward expansion,” Ostfeld adds, but acknowledges that we don’t know what else could also be contributing.The lone star tick is a sturdy, stealthy predator. It isn’t picky about conditions – it tolerates the damp of Atlantic beaches, and its western expansion only stopped when it ran up against the Texas desert – and is content to feed from dozens of animals, from mice all the way up. It loves birds, which may have helped it move north so rapidly, and it has a special lust for the white-tailed deer that have colonised many American suburbs. And, unlike most ticks, it bites humans in all three stages of its lifecycle: as an adult, as a nymph and as the poppy seed-sized larvae that attacked Platt-Mills, which linger on grass stalks in clusters and spring off hundreds at a time.Ticks detect scent with organs embedded in their first pair of legs, and what they’re sniffing for is carbon dioxide, the exhaled breath of an animal full of warm, oxygenated blood. When lone star ticks catch wind of it, they take off. “The Lyme disease tick is a slow tick,” says Dr William Nicholson, a microbiologist at the CDC. “Amblyomma will run to you.”There has been so little research into alpha-gal allergy that scientists can’t agree on exactly what stage of the bite starts victims’ sensitisation. One aspect of its epidemiology is becoming clear, though: the allergy isn’t only caused by the lone star tick.In Australia, Van Nunen (who is now a clinical associate professor at the University of Sydney School of Medicine) couldn’t understand how her patients’ tick bites solved the mystery of their meat allergy. But she could see something else. The beaches that fringe the coast north and south of Sydney are rife with ticks. If bites from them were putting people at risk of a profound allergy, she felt compelled to get the word out.In 2007, Van Nunen wrote up a description of 25 meat-allergic patients whose reactions she had confirmed with a skin-prick test. All but two had had severe skin reactions to a tick bite more than half had suffered severe anaphylaxis. The crucial detail in Van Nunen’s research was that her cases were caused by bites from Ixodes holocyclus, called the paralysis tick. Alpha-gal allergy was not just an odd occurrence in one part of the US. It had occurred in the opposite hemisphere, making it literally a global problem.And so it has proved. Wherever ticks bite people – everywhere other than the Arctic and Antarctic – alpha-gal allergy has been recorded.It was a sunny early morning at the University of North Carolina Medical Center in Chapel Hill. Scott Commins, who moved here in 2016 to become an associate professor, had 11 patients to see before the end of the day. Seven of them had alpha-gal allergy.Laura Stirling, 51, was fretting over a list of questions. In 2016, she found a fat lone star tick attached to her, and afterwards had fierce indigestion whenever she ate or smelled pork – a challenge, because her husband likes to tinker with a smoker on weekends. In 2017, she was bitten again, and her symptoms worsened to midnight hives and lightheadedness that sent her to her doctor’s office. She immediately cut all meat and dairy from her diet. A year later, she wanted to know if she could add anything back.“Can I eat dairy?” she asked. “Can I cook dairy? Can I eat it if it doesn’t have animal rennet in it?” She paused. “I’ve been symptom-free, because I don’t take risks.”Commins walked her through a protocol he has developed, a method for adding back mammal products one dose at a time. He has a hypothesis that alpha-gal reactions are linked to the fat content of food that might explain why they take so many hours to occur, because the body processes fat via a slower metabolic pathway than protein or carbs.He recommends that patients start with a spoonful of grated dry cheese, because its fat content is low, and graduate by slow steps up to full-fat yoghurt and milk and then to ice-cream. If those foods don’t provoke reactions, he suggests tiny doses of lean meat, starting with deli ham. Stirling lit up at that. “I dream of charcuterie,” she sighed.Because Commins was part of Platt-Mills’s earliest research, he has been seeing alpha-gal patients for more than a decade now. He estimates he has treated more than 900 men and women five new patients arrive every week. He has coached a significant number of them back to eating some mammal products and managing their exposures to the things they can’t handle, so their worst experience is hunting for an emergency antihistamine tablet, not being rushed to hospital.Patients still struggle to be diagnosed and understand the limits of what they can eat or allow themselves to be exposed to. But alpha-gal allergy defies some of the bedrock tenets of immunology.Food allergies are overwhelmingly caused by proteins, tend to surface in childhood and usually trigger symptoms quickly after a food is consumed. Alpha-gal is a sugar alpha-gal patients tolerate meat for years before their reactions begin and alpha-gal reactions take hours to occur. Plus, the range of reactions is far beyond what’s normal: not only skin reactions in mild cases and anaphylaxis in the most serious, but piercing stomach pain, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea as well.But alpha-gal reactions are definitely an allergy, given patients’ results on the same skin and IgE tests that immunologists use to determine allergies to other foods. That leads both Van Nunen and Commins to wonder whether the syndrome will help to reshape allergy science, broadening the understanding of what constitutes an allergy response and leading to new concepts of how allergies are triggered.Merritt, who estimates she has seen more than 500 patients with alpha-gal allergy, has it herself she has had bad reactions to meat all her life, since being bitten by seed ticks at girl scout camp, and was re-sensitised by a lone star tick bite last year. She is sensitive enough to react not only to meat, but to other products derived from mammal tissues – and as she has discovered, they are threaded throughout modern life.The unrecognised dangers aren’t only sweaters and soaps and face creams. Medical products with an animal origin include the clotting drug heparin, derived from pork intestines and cow lung pancreatic enzymes and thyroid supplements medicines that include magnesium stearate as an inert filler vaccines grown in certain cell lines and other vaccines, and intravenous fluids, that contain gelatine.Some replacement heart valves are grown in pigs they may cause alpha-gal sensitisation that could trigger an allergy attack later. And cardiac patients who have alpha-gal allergy seem to use up replacement heart valves more quickly than normal, putting them at risk of heart failure until they can get a replacement.There’s also a growing sense that alpha-gal may be an occupational hazard. Last year, researchers in Spain treated three farm workers who developed hives and swelling and had difficulty breathing after being splashed with amniotic fluid while they were helping calves to be born. All three of them – a 36-year-old woman, a 56-year-old woman and a 53-year-old man – already knew they had alpha-gal sensitivity, but had never imagined that skin contact would be risky. In the two main Facebook groups where patients gather, it’s common to hear school cafeteria workers fret about reactions from breathing the fumes of meat cooking.What this all means is that there are almost certainly people for whom a meat-containing meal or medical intervention could trigger an alpha-gal reaction of unknown severity.This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on Mosaic and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

As the government formally declared it would not continue with the debate on the withdrawal agreement, Lloyd Russell-Moyle marched forward to grab the mace in protest and held it up in the centre of the chamber to widespread outrage from the Tory benches.Conservative MPs shouted “Disgrace” and “Expel him” as he raised the five-foot silver gilt object aloft.The Brighton Kemptown MP appeared unsure of his next step and handed the mace back to Commons officials, as the Speaker, John Bercow, demanded he put it back down. The MP was suspended for the rest of the sitting.Russell-Moyle initially refused the order and remained in the house until Bercow said: “No, no. He must leave or be escorted. He should leave.” Speaking to reporters afterwards, the MP said: “The symbolic gesture of lifting the mace and removing it is that the will of parliament to govern is no longer there has been removed. I felt parliament had effectively given up its sovereign right to govern properly.“They stopped me before I got out of the chamber and I wasn’t going to struggle with someone wearing a huge sword on their hip.”Although the tradition of civic maces goes back to the 13th century, the Commons mace is believed to date back to the 17th century, with its current incarnation thought to have been made for Charles II.As the symbol of royal authority in the house, the mace is carried every day into the Commons chamber by the serjeant at arms, who places it on the table of the house.Labour MPs had earlier won an emergency debate on the cancellation of the Brexit vote. It is due to be heard on Tuesday and is backed by the Tory MPs Peter Bone and Sarah Wollaston.The official feed of parliamentary proceedings, broadcast on BBC Parliament, did not show the mace being seized in common with a policy on not showing protests.However, the footage was tweeted by a journalist in the BBC political research unit and swiftly went viral, potentially setting up a conflict with the parliamentary authorities, who fear giving airtime to such incidents can encourage MPs to take part in similar protests.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, was the last MP to take the mace from its place in 2009, when he was a backbencher.McDonnell was suspended from the Commons for five days for grabbing it in protest at the government’s decision to allow a third runway at Heathrow airport.In 1976, the then shadow industry secretary, Michael Heseltine, waved the mace at the Labour benches after his Conservative opposition lost by one vote on a bill. His shadow cabinet colleague James Prior wrested it from his hands and the Speaker suspended the sitting. Heseltine was made to apologise the next day.

Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.The insurance measure in the withdrawal agreement would keep the UK in the customs union and parts of the single market if no alternative solution could be reached to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.Morgan said committee members had found it “difficult” to give MPs adequate advice on the Treasury’s economic analysis of the withdrawal agreement and political declaration, given what was in front of them.The Treasury had analysed the economic implications of the white paper – the government’s plan for the UK’s future relationship with the EU – which was based on Theresa May’s proposals from her Chequers summit.However, that was an unrealistic expectation of what could be achieved, the committee found. “The committee is disappointed that the government has modelled its white paper, which represents the most optimistic reading of the political declaration, rather than a more realistic scenario,” Morgan said.The report itself found the Chequers plan “does not represent the central or most likely outcome” of the negotiations for the future relationship. “Therefore, it cannot be used to inform parliament’s meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement,” it concludes.The committee said it was disappointed the government had not provided any analysis of the short-term impact of the Brexit deal on regional or sectoral job losses or on the public finances, nor on the impact of the UK needing to remain in the backstop arrangement.“Trade negotiations can take four years to agree, and previous EU negotiations have taken longer,” the report found. “It is feasible, therefore, that the UK could enter the backstop. Despite it being neither the UK’s nor the EU’s preferred position, the government should have modelled the backstop.”The committee’s report was examining a Whitehall analysis, produced for MPs in the run-up to the now-delayed parliamentary vote. The study concluded that the UK would be significantly worse off under five possible Brexit scenarios in 15 years’ time, including the Norway model favoured by some soft Brexiters and the Canada free trade model favoured by hard Eurosceptics.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.The Labour MP Jo Stevens, who backs the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said: “The fact that the government won’t do economic forecasts on its deal shows what a mess its plans are. They clearly don’t believe it will be good for the country and want to avoid the embarrassment.“But the scale of deceit goes further. There’s something shocking and deeply unsettling about a government who refuse to provide parliament with the facts they need before the meaningful vote finally happens. They want the meaningful vote to be meaningless.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2bb756c76c91a00e0b677ddbc0857766dc8592/61_144_3396_2038/master/3396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d37a12f23a67bee04849f27c7a3011d3","title":"juncker no room whatsoever to renegotiate brexit deal","story":"European commission leader says backstop must stay in EU withdrawal agreementJean-Claude Juncker has said there is “no room whatsoever” for renegotiating the Brexit deal as Theresa May returns to Brussels in an attempt to reopen talks.The prime minister embarked on a frantic round of diplomacy with other EU leaders on Tuesday to try to salvage some concessions, but the European commission president reiterated that Brussels would not revisit the withdrawal agreement.Junker offered May only additional “clarifications and interpretations” of the contentious backstop solution, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The prime minister on Monday postponed the Commons vote on her Brexit deal, telling MPs that she recognised concerns that the backstop could trap the UK in a customs union without any means of leaving it.Speaking to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Juncker told MEPs: “There is a surprise guest at the European council, which is Brexit, I am surprised. I am surprised because we had reached an agreement.“Notwithstanding that it would appear that there are problems right at the end of the road, I will meet Mrs May this evening.”He said the withdrawal agreement was the best and only deal possible. “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation but of course there is room, if used intelligently, to give further clarifications and interpretations without opening the withdrawal agreement. Everybody has to know the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.”Juncker said Brussels recognised the backstop was the main problem. The EU could reiterate in writing that it would do everything to avoid the need to use it, he said, but the backstop protocol had to stay in the withdrawal agreement.“It is necessary for the entire coherence of what we have agreed with Britain, and it is necessary for Ireland,” he said. “Ireland will never be left alone.”A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Arriving at a meeting in Brussels, the Brexit minister Martin Callanan shed some light on what May was hoping for from her last-minute tour of EU capitals. “She wants additional legal reassurances that the UK cannot be permanently trapped in the Irish backstop,” he said. “That’s been the issue all along and that’s the issue at the heart of concerns expressed by many members of parliament.”Denmark’s foreign minister, Anders Samuelsen, said he and other EU leaders took the same view as Juncker. “It’s always a political option to clarify, if that is needed, what is meant, what kind of underlining is needed, but it is not a question of renegotiating everything.”May will meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, in the Hague on Tuesday to seek further assurances that the backstop would never come into force.Germany’s EU affairs minister, Michael Roth, told of his exasperation with the UK.He said: “Sometimes I don’t understand the world anymore. We spent so much energy and time and creativity on something that we neither want in Berlin nor in Brussels.“Nobody wants Great Britain do leave. Now the decision has been delayed again in the House of Commons, there are further talks but I’m lacking imagination to figure out where we could change something about the substance of the deal. Which means, what we have negotiated in painstaking negotiations, which has been demanding for both sides, the EU27 as well as the UK, it can’t be unravelled again now. At least I don’t see a basis for this right now.”The Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, told the BBC there were “plenty of options” available to May that did not involve reopening the 585-page withdrawal agreement.She suggested May was seeking change that would give parliament the “democratic ability to decide” about the use of the backstop.“That might include an addendum to the withdrawal agreement that sets out that parliament will vote prior to going into a backstop, should that prove necessary, and potentially that the EU parliament and UK parliament must vote every year thereafter to provide that legitimacy for the UK to stay in the backstop, should that prove necessary,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.EU sources insisted that while such joint statements on the need for regular debates would be possible, they would not change the legal reality that the backstop would need to stay in force if alternative arrangements for avoiding a hard border were not available.The 28 heads of state and government are to meet at the scheduled European council summit on Thursday and Friday, though there is no anticipation of an immediate breakthrough that would allow May to go back to parliament before Christmas.Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister turned May critic, said Tory MPs must submit no-confidence letters to reach the threshold of 48 needed to trigger a confidence vote in the prime minister. So far, the number of letters sent to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, has not been high enough.“We have all taken a bit of a bruising on this and it is a grave decision for every colleague to make,” Baker told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “But what I would say to my colleagues is: you now face the certainty of failure with Theresa May, you must be brave and make the right decision to change prime minister, and change prime minister now.”Baker urged the four most prominent pro-Brexit leadership hopefuls – Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey – to decide between themselveswho would be the candidate if May was forced out, to prevent a split vote.The Democratic Unionist MP Sammy Wilson said his party had ruled out the possibility of May succeeding in her talks in Europe. The prime minister could only return with reassurances that “don’t mean anything when they are put against a legally binding international agreement”, he said.However, the DUP has not signed a letter from all the other opposition parties condemning May’s decision to delay the vote. Leaders of Labour, the Scottish National party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens have written to May demanding more concrete assurances on when the vote will be held.However, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, accused Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour party of stalling on supporting either a confidence motion in May’s leadership or a second referendum.“As I understand it, they don’t think the time is right for a motion of confidence,” she told Today. “For goodness’ sake, if the time is not right now, when will the time be right?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36638656c7e81adddd91dfe05f3f0994cdc36383/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adea6dd74a36925fcfe9e634675a51da","title":"whats happened to you eu27 diplomats watch uk tie itself in brexit knots","story":"Mixture of despair, frustration and even resentment pervades diplomatic corps in LondonEuropean diplomats in London watching the government’s Brexit agony have conveyed a mixture of despair, and almost ghoulish fascination, at the state of British politics, with one saying it is as melodramatic as a telenovela, full of subplots, intrigue, tragedy and betrayal.“Anyone who says they know what is going to happen next must have a magic ball,” said one diplomat, who is charged with sending measured analysis back to his national capital setting out what is going to happen next.He recalled the fate of the Japanese diplomat who confidently told Tokyo that the leave campaign was about to lose the EU referendum in 2016. “Anything could happen, because in Britain these days anything does happen,” said one ambassador.But the European diplomats have also been gripped by the drama, one recalled watching a parliamentary debate on her smartphone as she was driven through the gates of Buckingham Palace for Christmas drinks with the Queen.Another said: “I do not know what has happened to you. Britain was supposed to be the level-headed one, but this is crazy and out of control. He said he feared no one was listening to Theresa May anymore: “She has no charisma, ingenuity or spark. She cannot win an argument here or in Europe.”The ambassador was equally scathing about Labour’s “constructive ambiguity” on Brexit. “Where is the leadership? This is serious,” he said.But for some of the professional politics watchers in the diplomatic corps, it has also been comic. One Estonian diplomat tweeted a picture of a man attempting a golf shot on ice, slipping and then crashing through to the water. “Brexit in a nutshell,” she suggested.Another ambassador expressed frustration with the conflicting signals and ision, saying: “Tip O’Neill once said all politics is local, and this is really an extension of Tory local politics into the field of foreign policy.There has also been frustration bordering on resentment at the way in which the deal struck between the EU, and the UK has been sold, even if there is a determination to make no further substantive concessions on issues such as the Northern Ireland backstop.Another ambassador found the negative reaction to May’s deal “not very unexpected”, adding: “There has been this gap in perception between the British and European politicians from the very beginning. There is so little understanding here that European states were not happy with the withdrawal treaty. They don’t feel like they have won.“Many of them have misgivings, and in many ways, the British have got everything they wanted. But there is a determination to turn the EU into the enemy, which is very dangerous since relatively the threat is Russia. That is the real and active danger we share.“The problem goes back to May’s speech to her party conference in Birmingham with the red lines. There was no diplomatic preparation in advance and no thinking about what it would mean. We are now in lose lose. It is very depressing.“The people that I do not understand or get are the Democratic Unionists. If they lose this, it will be worse for them. What they are saying is not popular in Northern Ireland. There are many regulatory differences between Britain and Northern Ireland as it stands.”Searching for stability amid the atmosphere of crisis, many diplomats would prefer May to cling on, despite the humiliating climbdown over the “meaningful vote” . Admiration at May’s fortitude is widespread though. “She is formidable, unbelievable, all these unjustified attacks I do not know where she gets her strength from but that is the nature of British politics. It does not forgive,” said one.Although privately many diplomats would love Brexit to be reversed, and believe it could mark a turning point against populism, there was also a wariness about the disruption of a second referendum. One ambassador suggested the French realised that European parliamentary election campaign of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, would be damaged by the sight of furious British leave campaigners claiming they had been cheated of their democratic rights by an arrogant elite who refused to listen: “What is happening in France is potentially momentous. The social fabric is under threat, and this anger could spread across the continent,” the ambassador said, referring to the gilets jaunes protests.Another said: “I have no idea where they think they are going with this people’s vote. Will it produce anything better or perhaps the same result, but the other way round? Does that stop the argument?“I fear this country will be discussing Brexit for another 15 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ae9c1146599a9616e44ba16c7b79fcb3b25eecc/0_173_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b03d1f017658546acea25f04004a0df","title":"brexit deal latest theresa may eu juncker tells may deal could be clarified but no room whatsoever for renegotiation politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s politics, as Theresa May travels to The Hague, Berlin and Brussels to seek EU support for concessions on the Brexit dealLabour’s Debbie Abrahams says all trust in the government has broken down.Labour’s Karen Buck asks why MPs should believe him about there being a vote before 21 January when the government did not keep its word on the vote this week.Walker says the government wants to abide by the spirit and the letter of the law.Labour’s Andrew Slaughter asks why the vote cannot be held before the Christmas recess.Walker says he would like it to be held before 21 January.Labour’s Stephen Doughty says the problem for Walker is that MPs don’t believe anything the government says anymore.

She says ministers repeatedly said there would be a vote yesterday until they pulled the vote.Walker says Cooper came to the Commons expecting a row.He says the government will put a motion to the Commons by 21 January.He also says he “fully expects” the vote to take place sooner.He urges MPs not to believe the conspiracy theories about this.Robin Walker, the Brexit minister, is now responding to Yvette Cooper’s urgent question about the meaningful vote.

This year there is little different, with widespread concern that things are getting worse.”Milburn was appointed after her predecessor, Alan Milburn, and his colleagues resigned en masse in protest at what he described as the government’s lack of progress on social mobility. He later accused ministers of lacking both the ability and willingness to deliver on “the crunch issue for our country” when confronted with the onerous demands of Brexit.The latest poll reveals once again deep unease in Britain about the gap between the wealthy and the poor. It also reflects concerns that the government, employers and schools are not doing enough to help the less advantaged get a fair chance.“This is a wake-up call for government and the rest of society alike,” said Martina Milburn. “That is why we are relaunching the Social Mobility Commission with a renewed focus on improving social mobility and driving real action across sectors.“We all need to do more to tackle these issues, but there needs to be renewed focus from government, educators and employers.”The SMC has 12 new commissioners, three of whom are under 23 in the hope of better representing young people. The government has allocated an additional £2m to fund new research from next April.Saeed Atcha, 22, one of the new commissioners and the founder of the magazine Xplode, said: “I believe there is always a need to have young voices at the table so I’m thrilled to be representing young people and bringing their voice to the fore. The poll shows they are pessimistic about their future and they do not have the right opportunities. It’s vital that we take urgent steps to address this.”Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said: “Whilst potential and talent is evenly spread, the opportunities to make the most of it sometimes aren’t, which is why the work the Social Mobility Commission do is so important and why we are investing £2m to expand its research and spread good practice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a487ab904651548e07e1923c36692e5673cccdf/0_117_3031_1819/master/3031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3242ed77ea0b92a825616bce0bec9738","title":"rugby league power free to air tv bbc england team","story":"If the sport wants a mainstream audience, it has to prioritise its relationship with the BBC and coverage of the England teamBy Gavin Willacy for No Helmets RequiredDoes rugby league take the BBC for granted? And are the RFL flogging a dead horse with the Challenge Cup? I left Parliament mulling over those questions after seeing a fascinating presentation by three of BBC Sport’s leading figures last week.Alongside director of sport Barbara Slater and rugby league correspondent Dave Woods, lead editor Alastair McIntyre – who also edits Sports Personality, Wimbledon, the London Marathon and the Olympics – admitted that the audience for this year’s Challenge Cup was the lowest on record. Just 4.5 million watched the seven ties on BBC TV, down from 7.9 million in 2011.“Domestic ruby league on the channel is declining with all audiences for live games below the timeslot average,” reported McIntyre, a St Helens fanatic. “For context, the 8.5 million people who view rugby league on the BBC this year is the same as the number who tuned in to watch the NFL last season.”Saturdays and BBC1 coverage guarantee the biggest audiences and yet that combination for the final drew just 1.3 million on the one Saturday of the year when half the population has gone away or out for one last bite of summer. McIntyre told MPs and Lords that the Beeb had been requesting to move the Challenge Cup final back into early summer for the last five years, especially away from August Bank Holiday which is the worst for viewing figures in the whole year! The RFL have finally listened.Consequently almost as many people watched the Super League semi-final highlights on BBC1 on a Saturday lunchtime – long after the games happened – as tuned in for the Challenge Cup final showpiece.The cup crowds don’t help. Empty stands turn off TV viewers, thus devaluing the event for the broadcasters in negotiation and decreasing income from the RFL. An outsider would wonder why they are obsessing with the Challenge Cup when the FA Cup final has lost its magic and rugby union long since gave up on their domestic cup.Instead, the RFL should be putting their chips on England. Year on year, the BBC get almost as many viewers for the handful of international matches as they do the whole domestic season, double in World Cup years. More than 4 million watched the three England v New Zealand Tests this autumn. “Internationals offer an opportunity to bring a much bigger audience to rugby league,” said McIntyre. “These games also cut through beyond the traditional heartlands of the game, with a bigger proportion of the audience coming from outside the North.”And yet England have played just 23 times in five seasons since the 2013 World Cup, and two of those games were not even on telly! Instead, the Super League clubs voted for three extra home games each – which brings negligible income for many clubs – rather than expand the international calendar. This short-sighted, narrow-mindedness encapsulates the game’s attitude.McIntyre and Slater were also positive about the share of female viewers (four in 10) and young people, although pensions remain the biggest audience. Online viewing is double what it was two years ago. Best of all, we like Chappers, Tanya, Nobby and the team. The audience approval rating for rugby league is the highest of all BBC Sport output, better even than Wimbledon.The governing body and clubs need to do all they can to keep the BBC onboard: yes, work harder to sell tickets for cup ties but also give the Beeb what they want, when they want it. When the BBC’s domestic rugby league contract ends after 2020, they may well offer a considerably lower fee or even walk away from the sport entirely. If they did, would ITV or Channel 4 even be interested given that they now show rugby union? We have been warned.Just when you thought the RFL had no feet left to shoot, Toronto Wolfpack have been kicked out of the (still unsponsored) Challenge Cup. Terrified of a repeat of the 40,000 empty seats when Catalans won the cup last August, the RFL have used a loophole to treat overseas teams – who are not RFL members and are invited into the competition – differently.They were told they must stump up for any shortfall in ticket sales if they reach the final and Toronto refused. It’s assumed Toulouse have too as they are not entering either. Imagine if the Dragons had declined to defend their title! Surely the RFL should have taken out insurance against certain teams (not just the overseas clubs but the likes of Salford, Huddersfield, London etc) getting to Wembley. For more listen to the Full Eighty Minutes.The Wolfpack farrago rather overshadowed the announcement that Red Star Belgrade (and North Herts Crusaders) will make their Challenge Cup bow in the New Year. Rugby league comedy: it’s all in the timing. The biggest club in the well-established Serbian competition, Red Star have thrived in recent years and clinched the Balkan Super League having been runners-up last year. It will be interesting to see who turns out for them in the cup. A couple of their British recruits have already signed for League 1 clubs here but they are technically able to register any free agents to play for them in the cup. Could be some interesting guest appearances.There were some rugby league big-hitters in Westminster last week for the BBC Sport presentation to the All Party Parliamentary Group. Along with the RFL’s new media manager Andy Wilson – late of this parish – retiring Sky Sports rugby league svengali Neville Smith was deep in conversation with RFL general manager Mark Foster in the pub across the road from the Houses of Parliament. They will not have been short of things to discuss.

It occurred when, in the west at least, we were basking pacifically under the blue skies of the End of History, with the collapse of the Berlin wall dispelling cold war anxiety, perhaps for good. This act of genocide was a reminder of how easily humanity can recoil into barbarism.Hugo Blick, previously responsible for the likes of The Shadow Line, set himself the invidious task of converting this subject matter into BBC drama, with all its protocols, demands and constraints. He pulled it off magnificently, by his shrewd approach to storytelling and to the unorthodox styling of the show, and with the excellent assistance of a cast that included Michaela Coel, John Goodman, Harriet Walter and Blick himself, as the brilliant but unpleasant lawyer Blake Gaines.Black Earth Rising tells the story of Kate Ashby (Coel), adopted daughter of Eve Ashby (Walter), a barrister working in international justice with a particular interest in Rwanda. Kate was rescued during the civil war – she has no idea of her real name but a strong sense of her Tutsi identity. She has experienced mental health issues and is now back working as a legal investigator in the chambers of UK-based American lawyer Michael Ennis (Goodman).Kate’s mother was extremely supportive during her breakdown but nonetheless she feels betrayed to her core when Eve takes on a case to prosecute a Tutsi general for war crimes. Of all the people to go after, she picks on one of the heroes of the Tutsi liberation? Eve never gets to explain herself – shockingly, she is shot dead by an unknown assassin in the Hague.What follows is a drama of intrigue, uncertainty and confusion for Kate, as she is called on to help defend Alice Munezero, half-sister of the current Rwandan president and another war hero, who has been extradited to France on a charge of killing a priest. The more Kate investigates, the more she learns, and the more we feel that something of great significance is being kept from her: a conspiracy involving Ennis, Munezero and US State Department bigwig Eunice Clayton, as well as her late mother and father. When the truth finally emerges about her true identity, and the reason for her being kept in the dark all her life, it is as big and wrenching a twist as any on TV this year.Coel is superb as Kate – required to be both tough and fragile. Beneath her determined, sardonic carapace lies a bereaved, lonely and bewildered soul, whose lack of memory of 1994 somehow adds to her pain. Her relationship with Ennis is a complex one intimate and distant, father and daughter but also, briefly on her part, romantic. And beyond Ashby’s central role is a hinterland of moral and political complexity, of pragmatism and neo-colonialism, and a burning sense of national pride that deeply resents western condescension.One of Blick’s many masterstrokes is not to address the unimaginable brutality through gory re-creation but through shrewd use of animation – the genocide, like the sun, should not be stared at directly, yet not shied from. “Dark” drama has become wearisome in recent years, often bogus confections involving serial killers adjacent to lakes or far-fetched conspiracies that go right to the top. Fictional as it is, at the dark core of Black Earth Rising is the very real and most brutal event of modern times, one that remains not entirely resolved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c7b865d82169cd37e31ffee2eccad82ae23063d/206_256_3294_1976/master/3294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d7c04c8e2e2e0539b9cd25c301c45a1","title":"how we made horrible histories jess ransom","story":"‘If someone getting wee poured over them helps people learn some facts, we’re doing our job right’The seed was sown when my son Jack – then 10 and a massive fan of the books – said: “You do history programmes, Dad, why don’t you make Horrible Histories into TV?” I spent several years trying to persuade my colleagues, that a comedy history show for children was an idea worth backing. CBBC eventually did. Nearly 10 years, seven series and 2,000 sketches later, it’s been a wonderful adventure.The great thing with the books’ success was that the comic, factual, gory, anarchic and anti-authoritarian tone was set. Terry Deary and Martin Brown – the author and illustrator – really understood something about what engages children with the past. No one could tell us, “You can’t say that” – we could point to it already published in a children’s book.Terry told us three key rules for Horrible Histories: it must be horrible, funny and accurate.Horrible Histories has a political dimension with a small p.

We have had fun with Christopher Columbus as a teacher getting his geography spectacularly wrong in Historically Educating. Now when I watch the film The Death of Stalin or the musical Hamilton, I see something of kindred spirits in them. My favourite Stupid Death must be the Greek playwright Aeschylus, who died when an eagle dropped a tortoise on his head. How random is that?It’s great to play the big historical figures such as Florence Nightingale or Mary Queen of Scots, but the ones you end up loving are often the ones you don’t expect. In the Great Fire of London episode, I had a brilliant time playing an old crone who just shouted: “Beware the egg!”I’ve been able to do some writing on the show in the past two series. We spend the read-throughs in stitches hearing new sketches. The jokes are as much for adults as for kids.There are so many ways to get information. If a sketch where someone gets wee poured over them helps people learn some historical facts and makes them laugh, we’re doing our job right. I really enjoyed doing the Storytellers Little Mix parody. Being in a girlband dressed as Beatrix Potter was a dream I didn’t know I had come true!My favourite stupid death?

When crime drama started to become more psychologically astute in the 1990s, shows such as Prime Suspect, and particularly Cracker, dug deeper into the dynamics of a masterly investigator facing down a criminal who is not quite cunning enough to hide what they have done.Now, though, interrogations are everywhere, to the point where Netflix has announced Criminal, a 12-episode anthology drama in which the police interview room is the one and only setting. Why are programme-makers so interested in them?On British TV at least, the high watermark of the modern police interview scene is Line of Duty. The show as we know it now was born near the end of its second season, when writer Jed Mercurio unleashed 17 minutes of anti-corruption officers interrogating a suspect. Mercurio had realised that, in a series where bent cops hide in plain sight, trapping them in a room with the good guys to see who won was his whole show, powerfully distilled. In so doing, he revived the interview scene as a pure form of drama itself, with total focus on what is revealed both by the words people use and – magnified by screen fiction’s ability to zoom right in on faces – how they look when they say them.The cops in interview scenes are on a desperate quest for the whole truth and, in recent years, programme-makers have been too. The present wave of exhaustive true-crime documentaries, starting with Netflix’s smash hit Making a Murderer – and including the streaming service’s latest documentary The Innocent Man, which drops next week and mirrors a lot of Making a Murderer’s themes – major on police interviews as the pivotal moment when the force of the law, justly or otherwise, weighs directly on a citizen. So has a new breed of all-access police docs on regular British telly, such as 24 Hours in Police Custody and BBC Three’s Car Crash: Who’s Lying?Audiences now are hungry for every detail, so extensive footage of real police interviews is fine. Our demand to know absolutely everything has also led to an odd micro-trend that cross-pollinates drama with documentary: last month on Channel 4, The Interrogation of Tony Martin, starring Steve Pemberton, took as its dialogue the verbatim transcript of Martin’s police interviews after he shot two burglars in his house in 1999. ITV went a step further than 2011’s Appropriate Adult, in which a lot of what Dominic West said while playing serial killer Fred West was precisely what the real Fred West had told police in 1994. The Interrogation of Tony Martin included pauses, stumbles and conversational dead ends that a traditional drama would omit – telling us exactly what that encounter was like, putting us there in the room as authentically as possible, took precedence. We are now fully invested in that battle of wills, in a confined arena, between somebody righteous and somebody heinous. The most memorable scenes in Netflix’s Mindhunter are not strictly speaking police interviews, but its long, talky two-ways between serial killers and Jonathan Groff’s criminal profiler rely on us relishing every subtle moment of push and pull.So we come to Criminal, overseen by Stag writingdirecting duo George Kay (also a writer on Killing Eve) and Jim Field Smith (director of The Wrong Mans). Spread across four countries contributing three stand-alone episodes each, it has attracted talent including German director Oliver Hirschbiegel who, as the director of Downfall, knows something about the power of dialogue in small rooms. TV drama is not ready to stop the interview tape any time soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcbf24da7d4bbc3db2b54720a33bb7244da9439a/318_0_4610_2768/master/4610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd53e415fbb0bbd9b3b8aa5913f0db48","title":"russian crew inspect mysterious hole soyuz spacecraft leak","story":"Cosmonauts to collect samples for analysis after suspicions foreign sabotage caused leakTwo Russian cosmonauts are preparing to venture outside the International Space Station to investigate a mysterious leak.It was spotted on 30 August in the Russian Soyuz spacecraft attached to the station.

He did not say if he suspected any of the crew but the statement caused some bewilderment.Rogozin has since said he never blamed US astronauts for the leak and accused the media of twisting his words.The official Russian investigation was ongoing, he said, and some of the station’s crew who were due to return to Earth this month would take the samples collected during the spacewalk.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneProperty values along the new Luas Cross City line in Dublin increased by as much as 8 per cent in the immediate aftermath of the infrastructure’s roll-out, according to local real estate agents.Some of the buyers are UK investors spooked by Brexit, say agents around Cabra and Phibsborough.The “Luas effect” means a typical two-bedroom home in Cabra east, which would have previously attracted a sale price of about €350,000, would now be expected to realise €375,000.In the run-up to last December’s expansion of the tram network, and its associated link to lines already serving Dublin’s suburbs, the real-estate industry predicted that a rise in prices would probably not be seen until several months after the trams began moving.That appears to have played out – local auctioneers noticed an increase of 6-8 per cent in sale prices from October 2017 to last March.It is a similar experience to other areas serviced by the Luas, particularly around the exclusive areas of south Dublin through which the Green Line runs.Research released by Daft.ie in October found that properties along the Green Line were commanding average prices of €524,000, nearly €140,000 more than the Dublin average.Paul Lappin of Lappin Estates in Phibsborough said there had been quite a lot of property for sale in his local area in the first six months of the year when prices rose. While this can also be seen as a reflection of a generally rising market, he believes it is mainly a result of the Luas.In 2017, two-bed homes in Cabra were going for about €300,000, he said, rising to about €320,000-€330,000 in the first six months after the Luas appeared.The profile of buyer in the area is now considered to be typically young professionals aged in their 30s, with an upsurge in owner-occupiers in place of previous renters.Vinnie Mullen of DNG Phibsboro said homes had been attracting sale prices well above estimates, even when the new transport line was factored into asking prices.In September a house on Quarry Road that was listed at €345,000 sold for €415,000. A three-storey narrow period property in Cabra Park, right between Phibsborough and Cabra, had an asking price of €449,000 and ended up selling for €475,000.“That was an area where prices were pretty static in the last couple of years we have noticed a jump that’s really down to the Luas,” he said. “There was a gradual change in the lead-up to it and about three months later we began to notice that there was more demand very close to the Luas stops.”London and wider UK-based investors are also increasingly seen to be entering the Dublin market and have been a feature of property viewings in Cabra and Phibsborough, according to several sources in the industry.One property viewing earlier this year in the Cabra area attracted 11 investors, including two from Ireland and six from London.Ken McDonald of Hooke \u0026amp MacDonald said they had seen a number of people coming over from the UK to invest in Ireland this year.“It’s not a flood but it’s increasing. It’s certainly becoming a feature of the market,” he said, adding that in one case a party was investing a pension fund in Irish property because of fears around the future of UK investments due to Brexit.Others are investing with a view towards UK-based multinationals possibly relocating to Dublin and a related expansion in the need for rental properties, he said.A City United: As Dublin\u0027s Luas lines come together we look at the impact on the city"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3726797.1544477498!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar and tusk agree plans for no deal brexit should intensify","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Monday. A statement from Government Buildings said both he and European Council president Donald Tusk agreed the Brexit withdrawal agreement “could not be renegotiated”. Photograph: PA WirePreparations for a no-deal Brexit will intensify following Monday’s postponement of a key House of Commons vote, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and European Council president Donald Tusk have said. Mr Varadkar and Mr Tusk spoke by phone after the British prime minster, Theresa May, announced she was postponing the vote, due to take place on Tuesday, on the Brexit withdrawal agreement.Mrs May has cited difficulties with the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border if the EU and UK cannot agree a future trade deal.A statement from Government Buildings said both Mr Varadkar and Mr Tusk agreed that the “withdrawal agreement is the best option and could not be renegotiated”.“They also agreed that preparations for a ‘no-deal’ outcome should intensify.” Speaking yesterday, Mr Varadkar said while he was open to further clarifications on what the withdrawal agreement says, any such clarifications cannot change its substance.“I have no difficulty with statements that clarify what is in the withdrawal agreement but no statement of clarification can contradict what is in the withdrawal agreement.”The Taoiseach also said the EU had already offered Britain a number of concessions, and added that the shape of the Brexit deal was due to the red lines laid down by Mrs May.“A lot of concessions have been made along the way – most recently, for example, we agreed there would be a review clause. I don’t think we should ever forget how we got to this point.“The United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union and the UK government decided to take lots of options off the table, whether it was staying in the single market or the customs union or a Northern Ireland-specific backstop, so the reason we ended up with the solution that we have is because of the red lines the United Kingdom itself laid down.”Senior Government figures warned against any additions to the current deal that would amount to a legal guarantee putting conditions around the backstop, adding that only a clause to unilaterally withdraw from its provisions would satisfy Westminster.A legal guarantee would be difficult to implement without undermining the backstop, it is argued.“You can’t do that and preserve the essential quality of the backstop,” a well placed source said. “I don’t see an easy way out.”However, some in Dublin believe Mrs May knows she cannot secure substantial changes but wants to confront the House of Commons with the consequences of alternatives to her deal.One figure said that while there was no “good Brexit”, Mrs May’s deal at least presented a manageable Brexit, while adding that the prospect of a no-deal scenario had receded in recent weeks. Sources said that, on the phone call with Mr Varadkar on Sunday evening, Mrs May outlined the difficult situation she was in, and the fear of many MPs that the provisions of the backstop could apply indefinitely. It is understood Mrs May raised the prospect of further discussions at an EU level and whether Mr Varadkar would be open to such a prospect. Mr Varadkar, it is also understood, indicated that would be a possibility but outlined that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Eric LukeThe .Former UK prime minister Sir John Major has criticised the “breathtaking ignorance” unionist leaders and Eurosceptics have shown over the Irish border during the Brexit debate.Sir John called for calm but warned that the imposition of a hard border was a possibility as a result of Theresa May’s decision to defer a parliamentary vote on the withdrawal agreement her negotiators reached with the EU.Delivering the inaugural Albert Reynolds Memorial Lecture\u0026nbspin Longford on Monday, Sir John described claims made by hardline Brexiteers over how any backstop would threaten the union going forward as “wholly misguided”.“Some opinion including many who believe themselves to be unionists has shown a breathtaking ignorance,” he said during the lecture, which seeks to recognise the contribution Reynolds made to the Northern Ireland peace process.“To them, Irish demand for a backstop is a bogus ploy to keep the UK in the customs union. In truth, a backstop is a vital national interest for Ireland and the UK.”Sir John and Reynolds have been credited with setting the peace process in motion through their co-signing of the December 1993 Downing Street Declaration.“If the House of Commons cannot find a way forward then the risk of a hard border remains possible,” he said.Sir John said a “reckless few” had failed to see the likely ramifications that a hard border would bring and that the challenges facing Mrs May’s administration were only beginning.“Even if at some date the prime minister’s plans are approved the problem is not solved,” he said. “A hard border, now or at the end of a long transition period or at any time would be disastrous. Peace isn’t secure, it never is and any new border would be a focus for the wild men on the fringes to reactivate old disputes and hatreds that should be laid to rest forever.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The New York Times were on the ground in Paris with the “Yellow Vests” protesters as they took to the streets for the fourth week in a row.

Photograph: Guillaume SouvantAFPPresident Emmanuel Macron on Monday night broke his silence over rioting that has plunged his presidency into its greatest crisis, promising a “new contract for the nation”.The French leader announced immediate measures to increase purchasing power, including a €100 rise in the minimum monthly wage, the cancellation of the increase in the general social contribution for pensioners earning less than €2,000 monthly, and an end to taxes and social charges on overtime from next year.Mr Macron also asked “all employers who can do so” to give employees a year-end bonus that will also be exempt from tax and social charges.A solemn Mr Macron spoke to camera, seated, with his hand flat on the table in front of him. He came across as chastened yet determined and looked younger than usual.The French leader began the most awaited speech of his presidency by denouncing the violence surrounding demonstrations by the “gilets jaunes” or yellow vest movement on December 1st and 8th.Four people have been killed, hundreds injured and more than 4,500 people arrested since the protests started. They were initially over a carbon tax on diesel and petrol. Prime minister Edouard Philippe announced on December 5th that the tax was “suspended”. That was later changed to “cancelled”.“The events of recent weeks . . . have profoundly troubled the nation,” Mr Macron said. “They mixed legitimate demands with an inadmissible cycle of violence . . .”Many of those arrested in connection with the violence have received suspended prison sentences only.Mr Macron also denounced the political parties who have in a sense freeloaded on the misery of France’s poorest citizens. All parties except the president’s République en Marche have declared “solidarity” with the yellow vests. “We have seen the game of opportunist and irresponsible politicians whose sole goal was to shake the republic,” he said.Most participants in yellow vest demonstrations say they identify with no party, or with extreme-right or extreme-left-wing factions.Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, the former Front National, portrayed the conflict as part of the rise of nationalist populist movements across Europe and around the world. “In his speech, Mr Macron showed he has not understood a movement that must be analysed as a revolt against savage globalisation, against the global caste that enslaves people, against looting by great financial powers,” said a statement from the party.After rejecting the violence surrounding the protests, Mr Macron expressed understanding of the anger of the yellow vests. “This indignation, many French people may share it,” he said. “I do not want to reduce it to the irresponsible behaviour I just denounced . . . This anger is more profound. It may be our chance.”The president spoke of single mothers, pensioners and workers who are occupying traffic roundabouts. “Their distress didn’t start yesterday, but we had grown accustomed to it,” he admitted.\u0026nbsp “Forty years of malaise are bubbling up.”The third part of his speech was Mr Macron’s mea culpa. “Doubtless we have not provided a strong and rapid response in the last year and a half. I assume my share of responsibility.”Alluding to the half-dozen sarcastic comments that earned him a reputation for arrogance, Mr Macron said, “I know that I have hurt some of you by my statements.”Declaring “a state of economic and social emergency”, he outlined his measures.The president promised to fight tax evasion and to ensure that the heads of large French companies pay income tax in France. However, he refused to cede ground on the wealth tax on capital investments, whose re-establishment has been a key demand of the yellow vests. During the 40 years the tax was in force, the rich left the country, he said.“We will not return to our usual lives as if nothing has changed,” Mr Macron promised. “We are at a historic juncture for our country. My only concern is you. My only battle is for you . . . for France.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3727377.1544534515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no room whatsoever for renegotiation on brexit deal says juncker","story":"The European Union is willing to give Britain further clarifications on its Brexit deal but will not renegotiate the treaty or its protocol on the Irish border, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday (December 11).\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJean-Claude Juncker said the withdrawal agreement on offer was the ‘best deal possible’. Photograph: Patrick SeegerEPA British prime minister Theresa May has been dealt a heavy blow in her bid to secure new reassurances from fellow EU leaders over her Brexit deal, as the European Commission president declared there was “no room whatsoever for renegotiation”.Jean-Claude Juncker said the withdrawal agreement on offer was the “best deal possible” and the “only deal possible” as the prime minister embarked on the first of her emergency Brexit talks with her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte in The Hague after she called off a House of Commons vote on her Brexit deal rather than face a crushing defeat.Mr Juncker offered a glimmer of hope to Mrs May by saying there was room to give “further clarifications and further interpretations without opening the withdrawal agreement”.Mr Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is room if used intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarifications and further interpretations without opening the withdrawal agreement.“This will not happen: everyone has to note that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.”He confirmed he would meet Mrs May on Tuesday evening but reiterated: “The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible — it is the only deal possible.”Britain’s parliament will vote on whether to approve Mrs May’s Brexit deal before January 21st, her spokesman said on Tuesday.Mrs May had been due to hold the vote later on Tuesday, but on Monday announced she would defer it and seek extra reassurances from the European Union to make sure it got through parliament.The spokesman also said Mrs May had earlier held a productive meeting with Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, the first stop on a tour of European capitals. The two agreed to work to find a way through the current situation, he said.Meanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney met with Cabinet today to discuss contingency plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Coveney said that while the event of a no-deal Brexit is unlikely, the Government has to be prepared to it” and ready to “speed up plans. Move from the planning stage to taking action.”During a dramatic day at Westminster on Monday, Mrs May told a packed House of Commons chamber that she would seek reassurances from the EU about the Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Coveney said he did not believe Mrs May had said she was going to seek the removal of the backstop, but that she recognised many were worried about it and she wanted to seek reassurances about the backstop and the issues around it.Speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, the Tánaiste said the EU had made it very clear the backstop is not going to change.Mr Coveney said the DUP has changed the backstop “into something that it isn’t, they’ve created fear. There is no threat to the sovereignty of Northern Ireland. ”He said Mrs May understands the fragility of the peace process on the island of Ireland and that backstop is not something to be feared saying there was no ulterior motive in it and that it is consistent with the promises to the people “of this island.”“I’m bringing a detailed paper to Cabinet about contingency plans,” Mr Coveney said, pointing out that plans will have to be in place for Department of Agriculture and Health inspectors at ports and airports. Plans will also have to be in place for aviation, fisheries and for recognition of standards and quality assurances.Meanwhile, European Council president Donald Tusk said he would put Brexit on the agenda for Thursday’s meeting of EU leaders, but like Mr Juncker made clear there could be no renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement or the backstop.Senior Government sources in Dublin warned against any additions to the current deal such as legal guarantees that would create conditions around the backstop.One well-placed source said that only a clause to unilaterally withdraw from its provisions would satisfy Mrs May’s critics at Westminster, and that a legal guarantee would be difficult to implement without undermining the backstop. “You can’t do that and preserve the essential quality of the backstop. I don’t see an easy way out.”Mrs May is currently meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and will meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on the margins of the summit on Thursday.During a phone call with the Taoiseach on Sunday evening, Mrs May outlined the difficult situation she faced, and the fear of many MPs that the provisions of the backstop could apply indefinitely.It is understood Mrs May raised the prospect of further discussions at an EU level, asking if Mr Varadkar would be open to such a prospect.Mr Varadkar is understood to have said it would be a possibility, but stressed that the withdrawal agreement could not be reopened.“I have no difficulty with statements that clarify what is in the withdrawal agreement, but no statement of clarification can contradict what is in the withdrawal agreement,” he said on Monday.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads a group of Conservative backbench Brexiteers, said Monday’s events had brought Mrs May’s downfall closer. “I think it’s been a humiliating day for the country.”The pound fell after Mrs May announced that she was postponing the vote and at the end of the day was down 1.4 per cent against the dollar at an 18-month low of $1.249, while the euro was up 1.2 per cent at £0.9048. –Additional reporting ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: ParbulPA WireWe are in the market for a “reassurance”. A clarification, not a renegotiated treaty. A way of demonstrating that the withdrawal treaty, and specifically its backstop provision, are not a straightjacket that will confine the UK against its will in the EU customs union for ever more.What then can be done for the UK given the constraints of the treaty? A declaration that the UK can unilaterally repudiate the backstop would undermine the safeguard completely and would be a clear breach of the treaty. Not on. But a clear explanation of the role and mandate of the little-understood arbitrators, whose binding role is provided for in the treaty to adjudicate a deadlock between the EU and UK over leaving the backstop, is another matter. EU leaders anxious to help British prime minister Theresa May out of her pickle are keen to offer some comfort. They were not helped, however, by the infelicitous, almost gloating, but erroneous, suggestion by France’s president Emmanuel Macron at the summit two weeks ago that the backstop review mechanism would allow him to hold up the UK’s departure from the backstop unless it did a deal to allow French access to UK fisheries.The threat was manna to the Brexiteers. Here was the evidence that the UK could be “held hostage” by the EU. But Macron profoundly misunderstands the treaty backstop review mechanism. The treaty provides that should one party, either the EU or UK, feel that the time has come to quit the backstop - when another agreement has been reached that does its job of protecting the frictionless border - it can apply to do so to the Joint Committee set up to manage the Northern Ireland protocol implementation. Should the joint committee, which has equal representation from the UK and the EU, fail to agree, the issue goes to binding independent arbitration.The treaty makes clear that by law, the arbitrators would only be able to consider two grounds for granting or denying the request - that the parties had genuinely been negotiating an alternative in good faith, and, to quote the British legal opinion, whether the party applying to end the backstop “had acted lawfully in reaching a view about whether the protocol was necessary to achieve its objectives”.While certainly not a unilateral right to withdraw from the backstop, the provision does ensure that an unreasonable veto by a member state or the EU itself, either in setting the bar too high or prevaricating in talks, would not be able to “trap” the UK in a backstop or customs union. The absence of a fishing agreement would certainly not be grounds acceptable to arbitrators. A “reassurance” declaration at this week’s summit by the 27 emphasising the role of and independence of arbitrators and of the scope of their mandate in any review of the backstop, could help to clarify the treaty provisions, without changing them, and should be able to answer the “held hostage” fears of at least some of Mrs May’s critics.The UK and the EU have both made clear repeatedly that they believe that a comprehensive future framework relationship which would do the job of the backstop can be agreed. Eventually. It is necessary now to come up with a means of safeguarding and guaranteeing the frictionless border in the interim. Any “reassurance” declaration from the summit must start and end from that point.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Once, that material filled the entire universe, scientists think – during the first few microseconds after the Big Bang, before there were atoms.The researchers found they were able to generate droplets of that strange matter, and it expanded to form into three separate geometric patterns.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCreated with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Baby mice tears could be used in pest controlA study from the University of Tokyo has found that the tears of baby mice cause female mice to be less interested in the sexual advances of males218 Final warning to limit climate catastropheThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a report which projects the impact of a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and warns against a higher increase318 Nobel prize for evolution chemistsThe nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded to three chemists working with evolution.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Our experimental result has brought us much closer to answering the question of what is the smallest amount of early universe matter that can exist, said Jamie Nagle\u0026nbspfrom the University of Colorado at Boulder, one of the many researchers who contributed towards the experiment.The cosmic mystery that remains at the heart of our universeScientists first began research on this strange matter in 2000, when they smashed pieces of gold atoms together and threw out temperatures that were trillions of degrees Celsius. In the incredibly hot soup that it generated, the particles that make up all protons and neutrons broke apart and began to flow, suggesting that generating the new kinds of matter would be possible.Researchers developed that technique so that they could be made more precisely, generating the quark gluon plasma by smashing together only two protons – something that scientists didn\u0027t think was possible.They found that if you expanded those experiments you could push the droplets into each other, which formed exactly the kinds of unusual shapes that scientists were predicting.Imagine that you have two droplets that are expanding into a vacuum, said Nagle.\u0026nbspIf the two droplets are really close together, then as they\u0027re expanding out, they run into each other and push against each other, and that\u0027s what creates this pattern.Scientists hope to use the findings to explore how the quark gluon plasma – when it first arrived, in the earliest miliseconds of the universe – quickly cooled and became the first atoms ever to exist.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB.

Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples.

Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20.

Crucially, he knew when to fall silent.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut he also had an acute sense of fun. Occasionally permitting\u0026nbsphimself a dry chuckle – as when the alarm sounded on his digital watch and a panellist quipped it must be his bedtime – Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas able to lay down the law when it mattered, evicting a heckler just last year after they began barracking Remain campaigner Gina Miller.Other celebrated encounters he oversaw during his tenure included Ian\u0026nbspHislop\u0026nbsptackling Mary Archer over her husband’s part in dragging the\u0026nbspConservative Party through the mud, Nigel Farage at daggers drawn with Eddie Izzard over immigration\u0026nbspand Eric Pickles facing a hostile crowd during the expenses scandal.Fiona Bruce confirmed as new Question Time hostThroughout, he remained the model professional.“Dimbleby has become virtually inscrutable,” Ben\u0026nbspSummerskill\u0026nbspwrote in The Observer in 2001. “Even his closest colleagues say they find it almost impossible to ine who he might vote for.”Equally adept interviewing John Lydon\u0026nbspas he was John Prescott, Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas on superb form in 2009 when BNP leader Nick Griffin was invited on to Question Time, a matter of huge controversy. The presenter handled the occasion by simply putting his questions forward and allowing the man’s absurdity to speak for itself.Asking the far-right politician about Holocaust denial, he pressed him:\u0026nbsp“Why are you smiling? It’s not a particularly amusing issue.”That same year, Dimbleby\u0026nbspmissed a show for the first time in his career when he was briefly knocked unconscious by a rearing bullock he was attempting to load into a trailer on his Sussex farm. John Humphrys stepped in to the hot seat.In addition to Question Time, Dimbleby has taken part in every BBC general election broadcast since 1979, his famous calm\u0026nbsptested in 1987 when Robin Day unexpectedly threw him a link and caught him out live on camera with a mouthful of Mars Bar. He rowed back on his retirement in 2017 to bump the unlucky Huw Edwards from the desk, apparently unable to resist the excitement of one last ride.\u0026nbspHe has also regularly hosted the BBC’s coverage of America’s presidential elections, memorably sparring with Gore Vidal during the Obama-McCain race of 2008, amused and genial while the writer was on cantankerous form, pretending not to know who he was and asking:\u0026nbsp“May I talk the facts of life to you?”The BBC has made good use of his gravitas for great occasions of state, inviting him to provide the commentary for Remembrance Sunday, the funerals of Princess Diana, the Queen Mother and Margaret Thatcher, New Year’s Eve 1999, Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the Brexit referendum of 2016.“The British people have spoken – we are out,”\u0026nbsphe concluded that night,\u0026nbspeffectively firing\u0026nbspthe starting pistol on the madcap bureaucratic chaos that has since ensued.Like his father Richard during the Second World War and its aftermath, David Dimbleby found himself providing the public face of the corporation, and uniquely suited to it. He might\u0026nbsp have equally become an MP, his privileged upbringing leading him to study politics, philosophy and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, the usual route to the hustings.Dimbleby\u0026nbsphas also developed a nice sideline in national heritage documentaries, fronting A Picture of Britain (2005), How We Built Britain (2007) and Britain and the Sea (2013) and\u0026nbspbeen tipped as a potential director-general or chairman of the BBC at various stages without ever quite making the leap.It’s Question Time though with which he is indelibly associated.\u0026nbspLoved for his deafening ties – electric pink is all in a day’s work – Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas always extremely game when it came to promoting the show on Facebook, wiggling his hips to “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones and even performing a Brexit rap: “We’ve triggered Article 50May’s letter was niftyMichel Barnier looks shiftyAre we going to have to be thriftyWith a recession in 2050?”This underrated side of his character perhaps explains the Dimblebot.\u0026nbspA spoof mechanoid alter ego offering a droll running commentary on Question Time via Twitter since 2009, the Dimblebot\u0026nbsptweets in block capitals to his “DIMBLETS” every week, hailing the work of “BIO-DIMBLEBY” as the real presenter\u0026nbsp“DEFEATS” his guests and members of the audience in debate.Adored online for his “DIMBLE-DANCE” and Teletext-style website, it is rumoured that members of the extended Dimbleby\u0026nbspclan buy each other merchandise from the site for Christmas, so delighted are they by the send-up of the patriarch.When Prescott raised the Dimblebot\u0026nbspwith the host and his unlikely online celebrity live on air in 2011, he responded with a laugh:\u0026nbsp“We’re having a serious discussion here but I do know I’m called ‘Dimblebot’ and I know there’s a Dimble-dance and I can do it, too… But this is neither the time nor the place!”Whether the creators are assembling a BRUCEBOT to succeed the decommissioned avatar of\u0026nbspBIO-DIMBLEBY\u0026nbspis as yet unknown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year, Samsung released another advert making fun of the design, featuring the same man now carrying a child with a similarly unconventional hairdo.With the release date for the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspanticipated for early 2019, the trickle of leaks and rumours surrounding the highly-anticipated device is turning into a stream, with the latest potentially revealing how the South Korean tech giant will negate the notch.Notorious leaker Evan Blass\u0026nbspshared designs of what a case manufacturer expected of the Galaxy S10, which featured three models for the lineup.As expected from previous leaks, the single lens devices have a hole in the screen to cater for the camera.The S10+ model, which will feature two lenses, makes use of two separate holes at the top centre of\u0026nbspthe screen in order to avoid the notch design.In a follow-up tweet, Mr Blass said: Usually I\u0027m a big fan of symmetry, but in this case, I hope the cutouts are offset from center as in the examples shown off at SDC.EDELSONAFPGetty Images)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspinclude a self-healing screen that could potentially put an end to scratched displays.A patent for a screen containing a self-healing property was revealed earlier this year, which described how such technology could be used in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspis set to launch on the 10th anniversary of Samsung\u0027s first flagship smartphone but it isn\u0027t the only high-end phone it plans to release next year.A foldable phone was unveiled in Ocober\u0026nbspat the firm\u0027s developer conference, with Samsung describing it as the foundation of the smartphone of tomorrow.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In November, Google acquired a 51.8-acre space in Mountain View for a reported $1 billion, making it the largest real estate transaction in the Bay Area in 2018.The acquisition gave Google greater power to redevelop and renovate the land beside its sprawling headquarters.Bayshore\u0027 (Google)The development proposal, first reported by CNBC, includes a Jobs-Housing Balance Policy that calls for a 4:1 ratio of housing to office space, while simultaneously making\u0026nbspthe North Bayshore neighbourhood a welcoming destination for people to visit.Transforming a suburban office park into vibrant new neighbourhoods also means taking a comprehensive approach to transportation and mobility – one that encourages people to get out of their cars, the proposal states.And better mobility options can have big outcomes: improving public health, changing behaviour, alleviating congestion, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle miles travelled, improving safety for cyclists and pedestrians, and simply creating great public places.Google will work with the City of Mountain View over the following months to review the proposal in the hope of getting approval to realise the project within the next 10 to 15 years.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Tatmadaw\u0027s tactics are consistently and grossly disproportionate to actual security threats, especially in Rakhine State, but also in northern Myanmar, the report added, using the official name for the armed forces in Myanmar.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the Myanmar military\u0027s actions as abhorrent ethnic cleansing, adding that the US\u0026nbspwould continue to hold those responsible accountable.The US\u0026nbspalso imposed sanctions on three Myanmar military commanders for their roles in the ethnic cleansing.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boca Juniors\u0027 fan cheers at a viewing in Buenos Aires for the Copa Libertadores final against rivals River Plate.

He later stepped down from the role\u0026nbspbecause I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. He also apologised to the LGBT+ community for my insensitive words from my past.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Oscars might give up on having a host altogetherAll the contenders to replace Kevin Hart as Oscars hostNick Cannon defends Kevin Hart by re-posting other comedians\u0027 tweets​Among the 2009-11 tweets was a now-deleted post that read: “Yo if my son comes home \u0026amp try’s 2 play with my daughters doll house I’m going 2 break it over his head \u0026amp say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay’.”People also resurfaced a video from a 2010 standup special, in which Hart delivered an extended joke based on the fear his three-year-old son will be gay. In 2015, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008’s Tropic Thunder because the character was gay and his behaviour was “real flagrant”, before adding that he’d never be able to play a gay character in the future.However, several LGBT+ comedians stepped forward to point out what they perceived as a difference between Hart’s comments and those by Schumer, Silverman and Handler.\u0026nbsp“I\u0027m a gay comic who has had his voice amplified by @SarahKSilverman @amyschumer and @chelseahandler,” Guy Branum wrote. “I\u0027ve been close enough with two of these comics to say I didn\u0027t like gay jokes that they did, and they respected \u0026amp engaged,” he tweeted. “I wish @KevinHart4real \u0026amp @NickCannon could do the same.”\u0026nbsp“Sarah has practically gone joke by joke through her old catalog and apologized for material she wouldn\u0027t say now, with specific reasoning,” Louis Virtel tweeted. “She has never been above criticism and it is ridiculous she\u0027s being compared to him.”Billy Eichner also provided his thoughts in a note shared via Twitter. While he tweeted that he appreciated Hart\u0027s apology, he also called for all comedy stars not to use such hurtful language.“People have been tweeting me \u0026nbspfor my thoughts on Nick Cannon’s tweets. I obviously can’t speak for the entire LGBTQ community. But here’s my personal opinion for those who care, which is probably not that many people. #SundayFunday“People have been tweeting me about Nick Cannon\u0027s tweets and the use of the F-word by the comedians that he points out,” the Billy on the Street star wrote. “I think Nick\u0027s point is a compelling one. I obviously do not and cannot speak for the entire LGBT community (obviously). But here\u0027s my personal opinion: Just don\u0027t use the word. It\u0027s as simple as that.”Neither Schumer nor Handler has commented on Cannon\u0027s tweets. However, Silverman recently re-shared a Twitter thread by author Greg Hogben with a heart emoji. She also replied to a social media user, who wrote,“but that whole part where you replied to a tweet where you used a word with ‘I don\u0027t use that word.\u0027”Hart\u0027s replacement has not been named by the Academy.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mission operators are still able to communicate with the spacecraft but it takes information – moving at the speed of light – a full 16.5 hours to make the long journey.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialNasa declared the spacecraft had left when the onboard\u0026nbspPlasma Science Experiment (PLS) showed that it was no longer detecting the plasma flowing out the sun. That outflow creates a bubble called the heliosphere, which envelopes the planets of the solar system and represents the edge of the solar system.JPL-Caltech)“Working on Voyager makes me feel like an explorer, because everything we’re seeing is new,” said John Richardson, principal investigator for the PLS instrument and a principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.Sounds of Mars wind captured by Nasa\u0027s InSight lander“Even though Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause in 2012, it did so at a different place and a different time, and without the PLS data. So we’re still seeing things that no one has seen before.”As well as the plasma data, Voyager 2 is still sending back other information that confirmed the fact it has left the Solar System and will prove useful to scientists studying interstellar space. That region, known as the heliopause because it exists at the very edge of the Sun\u0027s influence, is still largely unknown to scientists.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But that was because the plasma sensors on that spacecraft had broken, and Voyager 2 can far more accurately sense whether it still has the sun\u0027s winds buffeting its back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Ireland will never be left alone.”The Commission president described Brexit as “a surprise guest” at the European Council summit scheduled for this end of this week, adding: “I am surprised because we had reached an agreement on 25 November together with the government of the UK.”“The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible, it is the only deal possible, and so there is no room whatsoever for renegotiation,” he said.“There is room enough to give further clarity and further interpretations without reopening the withdrawal agreement.Opposition leaders unite to accuse May of contempt over vote delay Labour MP steals ceremonial mace in protest over Brexit vote delayEU president Tusk rules out renegotiating deal but calls new meeting“This will not happen. Everyone has to know that the withdrawal agreement will not be re-opened.”Last night European Council president Donald Tusk, who speaks for member state governments collectively, issued a similar warning. He said:\u0026nbsp“We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.”Member states, too, have taken the same line. Arriving in Brussels for a meeting on Tuesday, France’s Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau told reporters: “We are very much concerned about the postponement of the vote on the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbsp“We’ve done a lot to help the UK, this withdrawal agreement is the only possible agreement, and we’ve done a lot of concessions to reach it.\u0026nbspWe sincerely hope that there can be a majority to ratify the withdrawal agreement but we have to stand ready for a no-deal and we are preparing for it.”Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said on Monday it was not possible to reopen any aspect of the agreement\u0026nbspwithout reopening all aspects, adding that it was the only agreement on the table. He said no clarification of the deal could contradict its contents.The promise of clarification is unlikely to assuage Conservative eurosceptic rebels, who have said they will not vote for the plan unless the backstop is removed,\u0026nbspgiven a time-limit, or an exit clause.\u0026nbspThe EU has ruled out these ideas, saying the backstop would no longer be a backstop if it was not all-weather.It is understood that\u0026nbspEU member states could stretch to a so-called side-declaration at the summit to assist Ms May. This non-legally binding political declaration would simply spell out how both sides expect the deal to be interpreted, though it would not change its contents.The prime minister’s chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins returned to Brussels on Monday and was spotted in the European Commission headquarters – apparently trying to seek concessions on the deal.Created with Sketch.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

Quite a metaphor for the Brexit negotiations.\u0026nbspOpposition parties have warned Jeremy Corbyn has until the end of the day to table a confidence motion in Theresa May, writes Lizzy BuchanSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford issued the Labour leader with an ultimatum, saying he must act before close of play on Tuesday or other parties will be forced to intervene.Mr Corbyn is facing growing pressure to put forward a no-confidence motion in the government after the prime minister was forced to pull a vote in her Brexit deal at the eleventh bout to avoid a catastrophic defeat at the hands of her backbenchers.Speaking at a press conference in central London, Mr Blackford said Britain was facing a “constitutional crisis unparalleled in modern times” and suggested that his party, the Greens, the Liberal Democrat’s and Plaid Cymru could attempt to force a vote in the government if Labour won’t.Asked by The Independent for more details, he gave Mr Corbyn until the end of the day to act.Interesting moment in the Chamber just now - the chancellor Philip Hammond told his opposite number John McDonnell to vote for the Brexit deal on the table at the moment.\u0026nbspBut the Commons Speaker John\u0026nbspBercow interrupted:\u0026nbspIt\u0027s quite difficult to vote for something if there isn\u0027t a vote.Four opposition parties have written to Jeremy Corbyn urging him to join them in tabling a no confidence vote in Theresa May.\u0026nbspThe letter was signed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, SNP leader in Westminster Ian Blackford and Plaid Cymru Westminster group Leader Liz Saville Roberts.They said there was an overwhelming case for a confidence vote to take place now and suggested it would pave the way to a second referendum on EU membership.We believe a motion of no confidence must be brought forward at the earliest possible opportunity, to ensure there is enough time to pursue another course, they wrote. Therefore we want to emphasise again that you will have our full support if you put down a motion of no confidence.But Labour has made clear the best opportunity to challenge Ms May with such a motion would be following a critical defeat on her Brexit bill.The party said on Monday:\u0026nbsp“We will put down a motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful.“It is clear to us that Theresa May will not renegotiate the deal when she goes to Brussels, and will only be asking for reassurances from EU leaders.\u0026nbsp“When she brings the same deal back to the House of Commons without significant changes, others across the House will be faced with that reality.\u0026nbspAt that point, she will have decisively and unquestionably lost the confidence of Parliament on the most important issue facing the country, and Parliament will be more likely to bring about the general election our country needs to end this damaging deadlock.”\u0026nbspSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, Rebecca Long-Bailey - the shadow business secretary - suggested that Labour would not table a motion of confidence until the PM returns from Brussels.\u0026nbspIt comes after demands to do so from dozens of Labour MPs and the leaders of other major political parties, including the SNP\u0027s Nicola Sturgeon.\u0026nbspMs Long-Bailey told Today: We need to judge when the opportunity arises as to when this would be most successful, and we are currently liaising with various political parties across Westminster.Asked about Ms Sturgeon\u0027s criticism of Labour over a second referendum, she added: What we have said is that our priority is not at this time for a second referendum.We want to secure a deal, we respect the result of the referendum.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, has suggested that\u0026nbspTheresa\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspwas seeking changes that would give Parliament an additional democratic ability to decide.She told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: That might include an addendum to the Withdrawal Agreement that sets out that Parliament will vote prior to going into a backstop, should that prove necessary, and potentially that the EU parliament and UK parliament must vote every year thereafter to provide that legitimacy for the UK to stay in the backstop, should that prove necessary.So there are plenty of options for the PM to talk to the EU about that don\u0027t involve reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but that would provide the legal text as a part of the Withdrawal Agreement, through perhaps an addendum.Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

MPs should vote down the withdrawal agreement tomorrow and then support a People\u0027s Vote. If the country support continuing EU membership the court has told us we can revoke Art 50 and keep our existing terms. The threat to this strategy comes from Labour whose posturing around mythical renegotiation and a general election would waste the time we need to organise the referendum.The Commons committee on standards has just published its response to Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report into bullying and harassment of parliament\u0027s staff, writes my colleague\u0026nbspAshley\u0026nbspCowburn.It says greater freedoms should be given greater freedom to trigger investigations into historical investigations against MPs.The publication examined initial proposals for the House of Commons\u0027 standards system following Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report, which lifted the lid on a toxic culture at Westminster.The committee report said: We agree with the commissioner\u0027s view that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry relating to events more than seven years earlier is an unacceptable encroachment on her independence.We therefore recommend that this requirement should be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this.We believe there should be no exceptions to the general principle that the committee does not seek to direct the commissioner\u0027s operational decision-making.For that reason, we also recommend that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry into a former member should also be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this also.Labour MP Kate Green, who chairs the committee, said: It is vital that trust in the process is rebuilt, following the criticisms in Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report.Whilst there is clearly much more to be done, our recommendations will make an important step forward towards a fairer, more independent and credible system.The Standards Committee is unique in having an equal number of MPs and lay members on it, and these proposals will ensure that the skills and expertise of the lay members can help to hold MPs to account in the most effective way.No 10 has confirmed that there will be a Cabinet conference call at 11.30am but insisted this\u0026nbspis to update ministers on Theresa May\u0027s conversations with EU leaders over the weekend,\u0026nbsprather than about any plans to call\u0026nbspoff tomorrow\u0027s vote.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said the vote will go ahead as planned and Ms May is confident of winning it.This is from our deputy political editor, Rob Merrick, following this morning\u0027s No 10 briefing with journalists here in Westminster...\u0026nbspDowning Street has announced that urgent talks are talking place now with cabinet ministers, amid continued suggestions that tomorrow’s ‘meaningful vote’ could yet be pulled.Theresa May’s spokeswoman insisted that was not the purpose of the sudden conference call, telling journalists: “The vote is going ahead as planned.”Instead, the talks were intended to update the cabinet on talks the prime minister held over the weekend with various EU leaders, she said.The spokeswoman refused to go into what was discussed with EU leaders, saying it would not right to do so before cabinet ministers were informed.However, she continued to insist the withdrawal agreement had been “agreed and negotiated” – and that reopening it could backfire on the UK, by allowing some EU countries to push for tougher terms.Ms May will be in Brussels on Thursday, for an EU summit. Asked if, as rumoured, she could travel there before Thursday, the spokeswoman replied: “There are no plans to do that.”\u0026nbspOver the weekend, the prime minister spoke with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Junker, heads of the EU council and commission respectively, as well as with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the prime ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands.NEW: Asked if the vote is being called off, one Cabinet source tells me: Looks it.BREAKING: Theresa May will give a statement in the Commons on Brexit at 3.30pm. All the signs are that the vote is being called off.BREAKING: Theresa May has called off tomorrow\u0027s vote, a very well-placed source has told me.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has responded to tomorrow\u0027s vote being delayed. He said:\u0026nbsp“The government has decided Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour.\u0026nbspWe have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst of all worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain. Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We don\u0027t have a functioning government. While Theresa May continues to botch Brexit, our public services are at breaking point and our communities suffer from dire under-investment.\u0026nbsp“Labour’s alternative plan for a jobs first deal must take centre stage in any future talks with Brussels.”Steve Baker, the Eurosceptic ERG\u0027s main organiser, says:\u0026nbspThis is essentially a defeat of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal. The terms of the withdrawal agreement were so bad that they didn\u0027t dare put it to Parliament for a vote. This isn\u0027t the mark of a stable government or a strong plan.\u0026nbspHe added\u0026nbspParliament should be been allowed to voice its concerns about the proposed withdrawal agreement. Without a clear rejection of the terms by MPs, the prime minister has kicked the can down the road and the EU is very unlikely to re-negotiate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Let’s look forward with confidence.”Javid has said he will launch a leadership challengeTheresa Mays Brexit deal collapses and shes ousted as Prime Minister.He has reportedly begun to gather support from ministers and is creating a team to help him bid to become the first non-white PM.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are reported to also be seeking support for their own leadership bids.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Sajid is tapping us up. He is very direct, but he’s not offering jobs yet, which wouldn’t be a good look”.Another senior Tory disclosed: “He told me that Theresa’s Brexit deal is s***, she’ll be forced out when it falls, and he is then going to declare immediately”.Javid has said he would support a no-deal Brexit and has been backed by leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom.The government has been rocked by the scandal of Windrush-generation immigrants who have been treated as criminals by the Home Office despite living here legally for decades.Commonwealth citizens were encouraged to move to Britain from the s to s, but many were later unable to prove their right to be here. Some lost jobs, were denied healthcare or were threatened with deportation.Mr Javid said his family could easily have been caught up in the same situation after moving to the UK half a century ago.He told The Sunday : “I thought that could be my mum, my dad, my uncle ...it could be me.”He added: “I was really concerned when I first started hearing and reading about some of the issues.It immediately impacted me.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453848394-e1544047173818.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"immigration minister 600 foreign","story":"Ms Nokes made the admission as Home Secretary Sajid Javid revealed he wanted to review the ban on asylum seekers working in the UK as they wait for claims to be decided.The Home Office minister made the revelation as she gave evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights.She said: “We have management information -not published statistics, so therefore would require some quite cautious verication - but we think in the region of five to six hundred people might miss a reporting incident or otherwise abscond during the course of every month.”She said she wanted to be “very clear” about the term abscond.“When we’re looking at absconders then actually that might just be that somebody has missed one reporting incident.”While some foreign nationals who are subject to removal procedures are held in detention, the majority live in the community while their case progresses.As part of these arrangements, they can be required to report to authorities at a specic location at set times.A report from the chief inspector of borders and immigration last year disclosed the Home Office had a reporting population of nearly ,.Among those who could be made subject to reporting requirements are people who entered the country unlawfully or breached their original conditions of entry, and iniduals facing deportation as a result of committing a crime.Official figures published last week revealed the number of iniduals held in immigration detention has fallen to the lowest level since comparable records started nearly a decade ago.There were , detainees at the end of September, a % drop compared with the same date  months earlier.Last night a Home Office spokesman said: “Iniduals classied as absconders include those who are placed on a reporting regime but do not comply with their restrictions, for example, reporting to a police station or immigration reporting centre.“When their current whereabouts is unknown iniduals are referred to a dedicated absconder tracing team which works closely with the police, other government agencies and commercial companies to bring them back into contact with the Home Office.“Many come back into contact after a period of time being recorded as an absconder while others receive additional information to support their cases to remain or simplyto their home country voluntarily.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it is not the serious, sensible, unying compromise he believes. Nor does it deliver on the referendum.Joining EFTA — part of the European Economic Area — alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein would leave us nominally “out” of the EU. But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable. But it was their job to prepare us. Had they done so from , we would be in good shape.Chancellor Philip Hammond actually considered it irresponsible to spend money on it. The Government, incredibly, feared upsetting Brussels.Now they’re saying: “Brexit’s coming!

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position.

But of course there is room,used intelligently, there’s room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without reopening the withdrawal agreement.Everyone has to note that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened. The big problem of course is the backstop for Ireland. We have the common determination to do everything to not be in the situation one day to use that backstop, but we have to prepare.The European Parliaments Brexit envoy Guy Verhofstadt added: Whatever the request may be we will never let down our Irish friends. Its out of the question to renegotiate the backstop on Ireland.He suggested the best way to avoid the backstop trap would be for Britain and the EU to agree a closer relationship which keeps trade flowing.And German politician Manfred Weber, a close ally of Mrs Merkel, said: There is no chance to reopen the treaty that is on the table. We don’t play this game - especially in the Irish interest.Frances Europe minister Nathalie Louiseau said: We have to stand ready for a No Deal and were preparing for it.BRITAIN could have to enter the hated Northern Irish backstop after Brexit, evenboth sides dont want to, MPs have warned.The powerful Treasury committee said today that it was feasible that the UK could enter the backstop, even though Theresa May has said that its never intended to actually be used.However, the MPs werent able to model what the economic impact of the PMs deal would be in the short term.And they slammed the Government for failing to talk to businesses about how to prepare for No Deal earlier.MPs said their report shouldnt be used to inform the Brexit vote which was delayed by Theresa May yesterday.But they said Mrs Mays deal was the most optimistic of anything that could happen in Brexit talks - warning that the real outcome could be far worse for Britains economy.Committee chair Nicky Morgan said: The committee is disappointed that the Government has modelled its White Paper, which represents the most optimistic reading of the Political Declaration, rather than a more realistic scenario.The committee is also disappointed that the Treasury has not analysed the backstop and fails to include short-term analysis of any of the scenarios, including impacts on public finances and on regional and sectoral job losses or gains.Britain will fall into the backstopwe cant agree a trade deal with the EU before the end of the transition period.The back-up plan, which is hated by MPs across the house, would see Britain go into a customs union with the EU until a deal is reached.But secret legal advice published last week showed it could be impossible to get out, tying us to the EUs rules forever."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455352210-e1544525586109.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"remainers launch bid to force a second brexit referendum by twisting jeremy corbyns arm to back it","story":"Politicians from the Lib Dems, Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru have written to the Labour boss begging him to move a motion of no confidence in Theresa May.They think that will help pave the way for a second referendum on Brexit.Yesterday a desperate Mrs May pulled the vote on Brexit, admitting she would suffer a humiliating defeatit went ahead.She told MPs she would now go back to Brussels to fight for more assurances.Today shes flying around Europe for crunch meetings with Angela Merkel and EU bosses to see whether she can change their minds.Remainers say that the time to try and oust her is now because the Government dont have a working majority.But evenall the other parties in Westminster teamed up, there still wouldnt be enough votes to bring the Government down unless some Tories or the DUP voted with them.The Northern Irish party has said they will support the PM in a confidence vote at the moment.Yesterday Mr Corbyn chickened out of the bid to force Mrs May out of office, amid the days Brexit chaos.The Labour boss wont bring forward a vote of no confidence forward until she comes back to the House of Commons with changes, which he thinks will mean nothing to MPs.The party dont want to act prematurely in case they lose and end up accidentally keeping her in office.Scottish First minister Nicola Sturgeon also called on Mr Corbyn to oust the PM and go for a second vote, saying it was the only way to resolve the impasse in the Commons.Meanwhile the odds on a second Brexit vote have been cut again.Today, the Shadow Cabinet is meeting at a time of constitutional and national crisis.  The Government’s inability to pass its Brexit deal through Parliament, as witnessed by Theresa May’s withdrawal of her own motion in Parliament yesterday, leaves no option for us as leaders of opposition parties but to call for a motion of no confidence to be put on the floor of the House of Commons.Labour’s annual conference in September voted for a policy that commits your party to oppose a bad Brexit deal, seek a General Election and,that does not succeed, campaign for a People’s Vote. Today is your opportunity to begin fulfilling that policy by joining the Westminster Parliamentary leaders of the Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymruand the Green Party in supporting a motion of no confidence in the Government.We believe a motion of no confidence must be brought forward at the earliest possible opportunity, to ensure there is enough time to pursue another course. Therefore we want to emphasise again that you will have our full supportyou put down a motion of no confidence.Today, we ask that you, together with your Shadow Cabinet, agree as Her Majesty’s Leader of the Opposition to bring forward a motion with us to enable confidence in this government to be tested before it is too late and to put parliament back in charge of this process.  We intend to hold a joint press conference today at the IET in Central London where we will discuss this further.Yours sincerely  Ian Blackford MP – Leader of the Scottish National Party Liz Saville Roberts MP – Westminster Group Leader, Plaid Cymru Caroline Lucas MP – Green PartyRt Hon Sir Vince Cable MP – Leader of the Liberal Democrat Party.Remain campaigners will hold a press conference later today making their case for another vote.But yesterday Mrs May slapped them down yet again, saying holding a second vote would only lead to calls for a THIRD one in future.She told MPs in the Commons when asked about another vote by Caroline Lucas: Does she honestly think that If we were to have another referendum and it came out with a dferent result, people wouldnt say we should have a third referendum to find out what the result was And she added: I wonderit came out with the same result, she would still be asking for another vote.Several MPs used her Commons appearance to demand a so-called Peoples Vote on another deal.But Mrs May slapped them down, saying she genuinely believed that the peoples first say should be respected and Brexit MUST be delivered.Mrs May said: I believe that as a country we should meet those obligations.I think those people, many of whom voted for the first time when they voted in the referendum in , will indeed question why should we vote in futurethis Parliament does not deliver on that result, she stressed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004541609525.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"nick knowles im a celeb","story":"That was the question many of us were asking, last week.Step forward, Nick Knowles, DIY presenter, musician, chef, swimwear model, explorer, healer, fully unqualied astrophysicist and all round “hell of a guy”. A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

The Prime Minister had just arrived in Berlin for a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to discuss the Northern Ireland backstop. But on her arrival, aides struggled to open the back door of her limousine, lacking a unilateral mechanism to exit from the vehicle. But the situation turned out to be temporary, and after about  seconds she managed to escape. The Prime Minister finally emerged to shake hands with Mrs Merkel.  Shes due to travel later in the day to Brussels for talks with Mr Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk. The Prime Minister has embarked on a whirlwind tour of European capitals to seek reassurances to get her deal through Parliament, after cancelling a vote scheduled for Tuesday which she accepted she would lose heavily. But she was dealt a blow as European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker declared there was no room whatsoever for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement reached last month.  Mr Juncker told MEPs the agreement was the best deal possible and the only deal possible. But he offered a glimmer of hope to Mrs May by saying there was room to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement. The delay to the so-called meaningful vote by MPs means that ratication may not be possible until as late as  weeks before the scheduled date of Brexit on March . But Mrs Mays spokesman insisted she continues to believe that necessary preparations can be completed within that time. The Prime Minister held talks over breakfast with her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte in The Hague, which Downing Street described as constructive.  Mrs May told the Dutch PM that additional assurances would be needed on the backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexitthe deal was to get through Parliament. The leaders agreed that the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary, the Prime Minister set out the concerns held by many about it in the UK, said her spokesman. She discussed the need for additional assurances on this point in order for the deal with the EU to pass the House of Commons. The Prime Minister and Prime Minister Rutte agreed to work together to find a way through.

Suspending today’s showdown on her Brexit plan is a cowardly act and a futile one by weak and wobbly Theresa May. Hers is a humiliation that proves once and for all that, though she pretends to act in the national interest, our country comes a sad third behind herself and her awful party. The national good is all but forgotten in the PM’s need to save her own skin and her desire to preserve the modern Tories – that splintering coalition of venal interests that caused this mess and keeps on making it worse. But though May might run, she cannot hide. The leaders of the EU’s  countries know she will fail to secure substantial concessions. All those MPs ranged against her know it, too. Everyone gets it but her. The PM also cannot say when she will let our sovereign Parliament finally pass its verdict on her unrecoverable “deal”. She is fighting to survive, day by day.

The world in  would once have been imagined with cities in the sky, flying cars and commuter jet-packs. And while our reality is not quite as science fiction as past predictions, it is a pretty clever one. Over the past  years, innovation and invention has quietly shaped how we live and work – with the continuing evolution of smart home connected appliances, lighting and heating systems, and even smart meters. Smart meters are not only an easy tool to track energy use in the home, but the smart meter rollout will support the country in adapting to new, greener ways of generating energy, such as wind or solar power.  Smart meters will also help to inform the smart grid about real time energy usage and will facilitate a sht towards a cleaner, flexible system for a more energy efficient future. More efficient energy use is not the only smart development we can look forward to within our homes. The majority of households in the UK have access to the internet and this is paving the way to a smarter, more connected way of le. What impact has digital tech already had on our homes   In the last four years there has been a surge in smart TV purchases, with almost half of the UK’s population now owning one – allowing us to watch what we want, when we want. But it’s not just entertainment that has been impacted by digital tech – you can get connected devices to help you do all sorts of tasks in the home. We have automated vacuum cleaners, remote video security cameras, robotic lawnmowers, voice-activated lighting systems, app controlled heating systems and smart meters, which show exactly how much energy you are using in pounds and pence, via an in-home display.  All of these are relatively recent innovations that eventhey had been showcased  years ago, would have seemed more science fiction than science fact. “In the past few years, we’ve seen more progress in some areas than in previous decades combined,” explains Alice Bonasio, consultant and Editor-in-Chief of Techtrends.tech. “Experts in fields such as immersive tech, articial intelligence and robotics are constantly having to revise their predictions about when things will cross that threshold between conceptual and actionable. “The ones who prepare for it and embrace the change have a huge opportunity here.” How are digital systems being used by the healthcare industry - and what are the plans for the future   Not only will smart meters contribute to a greener, more cost- effective home set-up, some initial studies have suggested that by sharing energy use data, smart meters could help with in-home care of the vulnerable and elderly by non-invasive monitoring. This could be especially beneficial in flagging unusual behaviour patterns with older people who live alone. Here in the UK, evolutions in medical technology are being billed as the latest way digital systems can be deployed to improve not just the health of an ageing population, but also make access to health care easier. Trials for GP video appointments are already underway in some areas of London.

He had pleaded guilty to controlling and coercive behaviour, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault. Lucy is now speaking out for the first time. Lucy said: “Luke and I met through a mutual friend, it was my first serious relationship, and it was puppy love. “He seemed like a really nice guy, he paid attention to me, and acted like he really cared. “He was lovely to my mum and he was there for me to start with, he moved in soon after meeting me. “But soon after our relationship started he started pinching me, and digging his nails into my thighs. “He would do this on random occasions, and said he enjoyed causing me pain. He called it ‘soft tissue manipulation’.   “I didn’t know what to think at first, I just thought maybe it was something he liked, but I didn’t expect it to go any further than that. “Once you get attached, it becomes easier to let things like that go. “Watch out the little things, that’s always where it starts. “What started with pinching, became emotional and physical torture.” Lucy said because she loved Smallwood, who she met in June , she found it hard to acknowledge what was happening as his attacks gradually got more severe. Within a short space of time he began to punch her in the face, headbutt and bite her, and on two separate occasions hung her off of a third floor balcony, head first, holding her legs. On Christmas day , Smallwood strangled her until she couldn’t breathe, then released his grip, only to tighten it again once she had caught her breath.   He would also control her money, giving her an allowance of pound a week in only two pence pieces while banning her from seeing her friends and family. Lucy said: “The first time when during an argument he punched me in the face, I was shocked. “After the abuse, he would always try and apologise it away, but the punching never stopped, it just kept getting worse. “One night during a usual argument that we would have, he stood up and headbutted me. “I had to tell people that we were just play fighting and I accidentally clashed heads with him. “Another time when I put the heating on he woke up and beat me up for making him too hot. “I was paranoid about losing my job because he would tell me I couldn’t leave the house.   She continued: “Eventually he would let me leave, but confiscate my phone from me for the day. “He used to tell me my family and friends didn’t love me, and stopped me from contacting them. “He was brutal, he didn’t care about the damage he was doing. “He would hold me over the balcony and tell me he could drop mehe wanted too. “It was scary because even though it was a threat, he could have slipped, and he could have accidentally dropped me at any moment. “It was a game to him.” Survivor Lucy made the decision to go to the police after colleagues at work noticed she was covered in bruises. But she admits the after effects of the abuse still haunt her now, despite her strong nature.   Lucy now wants to share her story, with the hope that it will find any current victims of domestic abuse and show them getting out is possible. Lucy said: “I used to go out and do the usual twenty something activities. I was social and loved to have a laugh with my friends. “But when I was with Luke I wasn’t the same Lucy. “I even stopped posting anything on social media. “My friends told me I was a completely dferent person. “I didn’t recognise myself anymore, he drained the le out of me and left me losing my grip on reality. “The day I spoke to my manager at work, I went home and told Luke he didn’t have any control over me anymore. “A light just came on, I could see who he was.   She added: “It sounds weird, but I was still heartbroken, because somehow I still loved him. “All he cared about was controlling me, and abusing me with that control. “The most depressing part for me, is that I struggle to trust anyone now. “I wish I had listened to my friends, they kept telling me to leave, but I always found a reason to stay. “He used to tell me I made him the way he was, which I started to believe. “I just want other victims to know they’re not alone, the police were really sensitive and they were there for me from start to finish. “Be objective, and make the right decision. “Don’t ever let them manipulate you into thinking you deserve what is happening to you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"amorous couples crumbling romance given","story":"NewsYoung couples crumbling romance is saved by group sex therapy sessionsLucy Jones and Lukasz Reucki thought their relationship was over but following sex counselling they now enjoy group sexShareCommentsByJon Harris:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsLucy and Lukasz feared their relationship might have been overLtd\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn amorous couple have rekindled their crumbling romance after they both underwent a special course of therapy - to enjoy group sex with other people. Lucy Jones, , and -year old Lukasz Reucki feared their relationship would end after she introduced him to threesomes involving men and women - and they kept comparing themselves to their bedroom companions. The pair later called in a sex expert who runs a course entitled: Three weeks to Threesome. Using a mixture of counselling, timeline therapy, breathing exercises and a video programme which helps to overcome insecurities, Miss Jones and Mr Reucki were able to lose any thoughts of jealousy and were taught how to successfully have a threesome in three weeks.  Now the couple, from Crystal Palace, south London have since enjoyed group sex with another man and both say the experience was much better than before. Mr Reucki, a gardener, said: I didnt compare myself to the other person once. I loved watching Lucy being pleasured and instead of comparing myself I could relax and feel turned on. Im looking forward to sharing and going on more sexual adventures with Lucy - bring it on.  Miss Jones had enjoyed sharing her bed with both men and women with previous boyfriends and she wanted to do the same with Mr Reucki. But he had never practised group sex before and was worried that jealousies would destroy their love. He eventually agreed to Miss Jones request for another man to join them in the bedroom but felt threatened by the handsome stranger who he feared was a better lover. Mr Reuki added: It was a bit of a nightmare. We had meet this man and we all agreed to go back to a hotel for sex after meeting in a bar. I had agreed the safe word of pink with Lucy beforehand which would indicate clearly thatI was unhappy with what was going on we could both make our excuses and leave.  I immediately felt uncomfortable when we go to the hotel. I was jealous of the other man and did not enjoy seeing Lucy clearly enjoying herself with another person. I also compared myself unfavourably with him and felt that he was better endowed than me which sparked lots of further insecurities. It all ended in farce when Lucy was enjoying herself so much having sex that she didnt hear me say the safe word pink when I indicated it should stop. We had a huge row afterwards and I thought that would be the end of our threesomes.  Miss Jones said: We later met a woman in a hotel and I thought I would break the ice by kissing the woman to turn Lukasz on when we got up to the bedroom. But when Lukasz joined in, I quickly became jealous, just as Lukasz had been before. I felt that he fancied her more and he would carry on seeing her without me. But we all had sex and I think Lukasz really enjoyed it. I felt we both needed some assistancewe were going to embrace this lestyle more fully without jeopardising our relationship. After we have the therapy it was completely dferent to the previous time and a real night to remember. Lukasz didnt get jealous and I didnt feel guilty. We are finally on our way to being able to enjoy this way of le without the fear of losing one another. Louise Van Der Velde who runs weekstothreesome , said: The main issue I identied was Lukasz fearing he was not good enough and comparing himself to others.  I want him to feel like a sex god, not a sex plod. So I needed to clear his self-esteem issues and through timeline therapy take him back to the very first time he didnt feel good enough. For him, it was a childhood memory of being bullied when he was eight years old. Despite being in his mid thirties those insecurities still plague him today. After clearing those negative thoughts I then asked him to remember positive times when hed felt good about himself sexually and otherwise. I told him to squeeze his fist to feel confident and when he was plagued by insecurities to listen to his favourite song to take take him back to that happy feeling. Miss Van Der Velde added: Lucy had already completed my online video programme so she had already cleared her negative emotions which had built up from a young age. But she still had feelings of fear, sadness, jealousy, lack of confidence, anger, frustration, and guilt.  Through tapping - a technique used to stimulate your emotional pressure points by using your finger tips - I taught her how to move energy around her body to have more positive orgasms to make her feel great. The next part of the one hour session was to make her feel sexually confident and to make her bond with Lukasz unbreakable. I taught the pair Tantric breathing exercises to help them become in tune with one another. They had to to breathe in unison and into each others mouth when they had sex. Lucy also did ten minutes a day of tapping on the emotional pressure points to release her fear of losing Lukasz and fear of being judged.  For the final session, the couple did a joint Skype session where I taught them how to anchor their love by squeezing each others hands when in a situation where they needed to reassure one another. Once they had completed their therapy, I shared my top tips on finding the right threesome partner, where to meet and how to successfully have one. It was amazing - both seemed much happier and confident within themselves and no longer feared losing the other one. Louises ten tips on how to enjoy a threesome without wrecking your relationship:Firstly, ask yourself why youre having a threesome  Do you really want it  Are you prepared to share your partner  Use empowering counselling tools such as Emotional Freedom Techniques . Go back in your mind and find the point where you first experienced a jealous thought and clear it from your mind. Dont choose a friend for a threesome - find a stranger on a website like Illicitencounters and make sure you both browse the site together to choose the right person, never alone. Once you have found the right person, get to know them by speaking to them first. Be honest with what youre prepared to do and how far youre prepared to share each other. Never invite anyone to your home, - choose somewhere neutral like a hotel. Set a safe word - this is a word which you can use to tell your partner youre uncomfortable and you want to leave. Dont pay the other person in the threesome more attention than your partner unless this is part of your kink. If you do, this could lead to insecurities and arguments afterwards. See this as a growth experience - there will be lessons you can both learn as you go forward. Use Tantra and build your energy as a couple so you know your bond is unbreakable. Never ever do something youre not happy with. Its your beautul body, so own it fully."},{"url":null,"title":"dog lover spends 5k christmas","story":"NewsDog lover spends £k on Christmas presents for pooch called Princess Cleopatra SuperchillPersonal trainer Anthony Welsh, , from Liverpool, has no children and instead lavishes all his money on his ‘daughter’, a seven-year-old Staffordshire Bull TerrierShareCommentsByBethany PapworthAliki Kraterou:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsThe beloved pooch appears robed in royal red \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis ultimate dog lover has splashed out pound, on presents for his pooch this Christmas – after spending nearly pound, over the hound’s le.

The huge sum was highlighted by a taxi driver in Liverpool, where black cab drivers have been criticised recently for their high charges. The high-figure was quoted on Saturday afternoon for a theoretical journey from Bramley-Moore Dock to Glebe Hey in Belle Vale. Surge prices elevated the cost by pound to pound. Hackney cab drivers were criticised recently after Danish Liverpool FC fans were charged pound for a journey from Anfield to the city centre, not what was on the meter. But the disgruntled cabbie contacted the Liverpool Echo to say the way Uber operates in surge periods is no dferent.   The screenshot of the quote shows the app explaining that fares are a lot higher due to increased demand. It then goes on to quote a price of between pound-pound for a standard UberX journey, with a larger Uber XL priced at pound to pound and the more luxurious Exec journey quoted for between pound and pound. According to Ubers official fare estimator website, the same journey at a non surge time would cost pound to pound. Uber says it has always been up front about how its surge pricing policy works - and says it allows customers to choose whether they pay the larger fees or not.   On its website, Uber states: “There are times when so many people are requesting rides that there aren’t enough cars on the road to help take them all. “Bad weather, rush hour, and special events, for instance, may cause unusually large numbers of people to want to ride Uber all at the same time. “In these cases of very high demand, fares may increase to help ensure those who need a ride can get one. This system is called surge pricing, and it lets us continue to be a reliable choice. “Whenever we raise rates due to surge pricing, we let riders know in the app. Some riders will choose to pay, while some will choose to wait a few minutes to seethe rates go back down to normal.”has approached Uber for further comment.

Conspiracy theorists have long revered her prophecies on global events and natural disasters - despite her being dead for over two decades. Now it appears she has foretold some le-changing occurrences for the next  months, including an economic collapse in Europe and an assassination attempt on Vladmir Putin. She reportedly believed the threat to Putin will come from inside his own security team - but did not specy whether the head of state will die in the attack. She thinks a mega-tsunami, similar to the  disaster, will strike in Asia while a meteorite will land in Russia.  Not only that, but Donald Trump will fall ill with a mystery illness, leaving him deaf and suffering from brain trauma.

Her millions of followers believe she had paranormal abilities including telepathy and being able to communicate with aliens.

From Mariah Careys smash hit, to that catchy Wham number and carols such as Silent Night... the list goes on and on. But did you know that one of the most popular tunes youll hear over the festive period isnt meant to be a Christmas song  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Jingle Bells isnt really a Christmas carol - it was originally intended to celebrate a very dferent holiday.  Written in by James Pierpoint, the song is actually an American classic about Thanksgiving and as such it used to have a very dferent title. When it was first conceived the song was called One Horse Open Sleigh. However because a lot of the lyrics are about winter fun, many people in Britain often tend to ignore half of the words when they sing it during carol concerts in order to keep it Christmassy. Thus, the song soon became known as Jingle Bells instead.  If you take a look at some the original verses, youd probably be very confused as many of the lines are unrecognizable and have little to do with Chrimbo. A day or two ago I thot Id take a ride And soon Miss Fannie Bright Was seated by my side. The horse was lean and lank Misfortune seemed his lot He got into a drted bank And we—we got upsot. No, we dont know who Miss Fannie Bright is, but shes not Mrs Claus, thats for sure.  There are suggestions that Jingle Bells used to be sung by schoolchildren, while others believe it was too racy for that, and instead it was bellowed as a drinking party song. Apparently riding around in a sleigh allowed couples to get together back in the day -you catch our drt. But dont be disheartened by all this, because today its widely accepted that Jingle Bells is a Christmas tune. Although not intended to be so, these days its associated with the festive season, and you can sing it in the run up to Christmas day as much as youd like.

Little Madelyne Jones, was recording herself on her mum Katie Mercers phone when a mans voice can be heard - even though no men were in their home. In the footage, the three-year-old uses a harlequin filter over her face and speaks into the camera saying a cheeky, little before pausing as though shes thinking. While the toddler stopped to mull over her next word, a male voice can clearly be heard prompting Madelyne, saying the word monkey which the little girl then repeats. After hearing the voice and freaking out, -year-old Katie showed the video to her mum Sarah Mercer, , who immediately identied it as her late husband Peter Mercer.  Peter, who was nicknamed Peter Pan by his friends and family, sadly passed away from throat cancer at age  when Madelyne was just five months old. Full-time mum-of-two Katie, of Conwy, North Wales, said: Madelyne likes to take videos of herself on my phone. This time she was using a filter but its not a voice changing filter. Its her voice you can hear for most of the video. I didnt hear the mans voice until the fth time Id replayed the video. Madelyne starts off saying a cheeky, little and then she paused like shes thinking. I think she paused because recently she overheard me saying cheeky, little b**** on the phone. I think she wanted to repeat it but knew shed get in troubleshe said the b-word.  While shes paused you can hear a male voice say monkey like hes prompting her. Then Madelyne says monkey. The mans voice and what hes saying is so clear. Its crazy. When I first heard it I really freaked out. I showed the video to my mum and she instantly said it sounds like my dad. Quite a few people have said the same since then. It is a bit freaky but I really do believe its him and its so comforting to know hes with her and looking after her. This video isnt the first hint Katie has had that her dad might be watching over Madelyne. The little girl often tells her mum about a ghost in the house and instead of playing with her little sister Louisa Jones, two, sits alone chatting away in one-sided conversations. When Madelynes mum asks her what shes up to, the tot replies that shes playing with grandad. Katie said: There have been a few things that have gone on before this. Madelyne would tell me about a ghost going up and down the stairs at night.  I tried to tell her its just the house going to sleep because thats what my dad used to tell me but she replied no, its the ghost who sleeps in my bedroom. That really freaked me out. Then recently I noticed that instead of playing with Louisa, Madelyne has started playing alone and shell have these one-sided conversations. Its not like she has an invisible friend. She actually stops asshes listening to someone replying to her. When Ive asked her what shes doing, she tells me shes playing with grandad. My dad passed away when Madelyne was just five months old so shes too young to remember him. He did get to meet her after she was born. He loved every bone of her.  Everyone called my dad Peter Pan because he was so outgoing and young at heart. People never would have thought hed go, especially not as young as he did. While some people have been sceptical about the video, it has made Katie a firm believer in the paranormal. Katie said: Some people have said the voice sounds robotic and that the video is edited but I dont even know how to edit videos. I used to be the same. I was so sceptical when people would tell me about their paranormal experiences. But after listening to this video and hearing my dad, I really do believe. Its made me so much more open-minded.

The woman said that her dad died suddenly and unexpectedly in her family home nine years ago, and due to circumstances she is living back there at the moment.But yesterday after waking up she experienced something very spooky that makes her wonder whether her dad is still present in the house in some way.Writing on Mumsnet, she said: My mum has mentioned a few times over the years that shes felt my dads presence here and Ive always been openly kind to her about it.  Shes mentioned shes felt pressure on the bed assomeone has sat down on it next to her for example. The woman confessed she thought her mums imagination was getting the better of her as she was grieving - until now. She continued: Anyway, this morning [my partner] has left for work and I was still in bed. I was listening to him brushing his teeth, then popping the kettle on so I was definitely awake, but a little drowsy.I felt him get back into bed with me and thought whats he doing ... its not unusual for him to pop back into the bedroom and give me a hug or kiss before leaving the house.I felt the heaviness of him pressed against my back and his arms wrapped around me. There was a heat between my shoulder blades I have never felt before but I wasnt scared but I knew it wasnt [my partner] then. I heard the front door open so [partner] was leaving the house. Then my whole back went tingly a bit like pins and needles but not in an unpleasant way.When it was happened I felt calm and warm but I’m freaking out now and can’t stop crying. Sounds silly but I feel like it may have been my dad.  She added that she was definitely awake and is now questioning everything. The post had hundreds of replies from people with thoughts and suggestions about what may have happened to her.Some believe she may have been experiencing sleep paralysis - a condition where you are temporarily unable to move when going to sleep or waking up, which can cause people to sense something  in the room.Others said they have had similar feelings after loved ones died.Another said: My mum died  years ago, but on a handful of occasions Ive felt her come and sit on the bed next to me. I wasnt particularly thinking about her at the time. Rationally, I tell myself I was dreaming. But I still think it was her.

According to photographer, Adele Sneyd, , who took the pictures in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, in spite of the giraffes deformity, she is healthy and able to eat without any problems. Adele, from Pretoria, South Africa, said: “At first I thought she had something stuck in her mouth but when she turned her head I saw the deformity. “She is in healthy condition and her coat shiny. She eats in a unique way but it doesn’t seem to bother her at all.“She seemed perfectly happy. I was amazed that she adapted so well. She seems to be a fully developed adult female and was part of a group of seven other giraffes.  “I sat observing her for an hour or so. Looking at the images while processing them I was delighted to have captured them and able to share them with nature lovers. Nature finds a way to adapt and it was a blessing being able to observe this. I love how her eyes sparkle.” Adele, a retired human growth coach who now does wildle photography full time, said after spotting the giraffe she went home and did research on her condition, discovering it was called Wry Face. Wry Face is a congenital deformity that cases an animal’s face to look twisted. There is no known cause or cure for it.

Alan Gilzean had a brilliant hat-trick, his deft touches were a joy to watch.“The cross swung over from Gordon Smith into Cologne’s box was met by Gilzean, and his head launched a guided missile, the ball bulged and strained the goal net.“The crescendo from Dens was fuelled by an emotional cocktail of euphoria and incredulity, a local wag told me the noise was heard in Cologne. This was the European Cup – how was this possible  The final score of Dundee  Cologne .”The tournament progressed, as did Rob: “Dundee FC and the European campaign advanced.“Sporting Lisbon came to Dens, as did Anderlecht, and Alan Gilzean had notched eight goals so far in this tournament between home and away games. And now the European Cup semi-finals, the first game would be in Italy against AC Milan, and The Courier the morning after the game described it as ugly and rough.“In thegame at Dens, Alan Gilzean was sent off after eventually retaliating against the brutal attacks on him from Milan players.“It was an exit of frustration for Dundee FC from the European Cup and it stripped naivety from all Dundee football fans in the belief that this sport should be played in the spirit of fair play by both teams, and that referee decisions would be unbiased and judicious.”Rob concluded: Some years ago, I would frequent a watering hole called The Saracens Head, and among the patrons were a couple of lads who hailed from north London.“They were Spurs fans. When they described the on-field exploits of Alan Gilzean, it was with awe and reverence.“And, after a few cocktails, one of them would burst into a song that was sung at White Hart Lane that hailed Gilzean and Chivers.“Much has been written about Alan Gilzean, but not enough can be said.“One of the great front men to come out of Scotland with  caps.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blether ex dundee and dundee united man jimmy borland left school after select match","story":"Jimmy Borland is a regular contributor to this column and, indeed, also to the Tele letters page.No mean goalkeeper in his day, he is well known as a long-time goalie in the juniors, notably for North End and Lochee Harp.As a schoolboy at Stobswell Secondary School, he was chosen to represent the Dundee Schoolboys U  Select in .Said Jimmy: “This team beat Aberdeen - at the old St Joseph’s park in Gilburn Road, Kirkton, Dundee.“I was the reserve goalkeeper and actually left school after that game.“We had a good side and at least four players had trials for senior clubs.”Jimmy has sent in a photo of the select squad, which is featured below .Back row– Martin , D Sharp , I Sharp , Coull , Neish , Borland , Higgins , Cullen .Front row – Cochrane , Ky , Stirling , Gearie , Hay , Breslin , Wallace .As well as stints at Montrose and Raith Rovers, Gordon Wallace would go on to play and coach at Dundee United.He also played for, coached and managed Dundee, in addition to spells at other clubs."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee chief john nelms says funding for 15m new stadium is taking a long long time","story":"Dundee managing director John Nelms has admitted progress with the plan to build a new stadium has been considerably slower than expected.But the Dark Blues remain firm in their determination to move to a new home adjacent to the city’s Camperdown Park.Originally Dundee had hoped worked would be under way in the summer but the project remains at the planning stage.“My timescale was six months ago to have the project in for review by the summer,” said Nelms.“I’ll keep pushing and, hopefully, have it sooner than that.”One stumbling block has been putting together the funding for a development that’s likely to cost at least £ million overall.“We have a public partnership when it comes to the financing and that process takes a long, long time” added Nelms."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a4d2bd11e3.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds callum booth says ayr loss was a needed wake up call","story":"As tough as it was to take, Dundee United full-back Callum Booth believes last Friday’s - home defeat at the hands of Ayr was the wake-up call they needed at this stage of the season.Defender Booth admits it was a shock to the system for the Tangerines losing so heavily to the Championship leaders at Tannadice last week but insists the result is behind them as they aim to regain momentum built under new boss Robbie Neilson.The Terrors were unbeaten in six until the loss to The Honest Men and the -year-old feels they have got what it takes to go on a similar run – starting at Morton today.“We’d been doing brilliantly since the new manager came in and I don’t think anyone saw that scoreline coming at all,” the former Hibs and Partick Thistle left-back said.“It was a shock and maybe a bit of a wake-up call. We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee woman drank heavily went to nightclub lost her coat and shoes then drove home","story":"A woman was fined £ and disqualied from driving for  months.Hayleigh Michie, , of Bridgefoot Farm, admitted driving a car while three and half times the legal limit, giving a reading of mics of alcohol in ml of breath at Charleston Drive on November .The court heard she had been drinking heavily with an ex-partner and had gone to a nightclub and lost her coat, shoes and bag, then decided to drive home."},{"url":null,"title":"long awaited us takeover of dundee united moves closer","story":"Rumours the long-awaited Dundee United takeover is nearing completion are growing.So far there has been no statement from either the Tangerines nor the prospective new owners – believed to be American-based businessmen – but it has been suggested a deal to buy the shareholding of chairman Mike Martin has been agreed.Martin controls just over % of the stock and that means new owners would also need at least some of the shares of his fellow director Jim Fyffe who has around %.Their shareholdings were confirmed in a list lodged at Companies House in Edinburgh recently.There had been speculation new owners would be confirmed last week and although that didn’t happen, it does now seem change at the top could be on the way.It’s understood United are set clary whether or not the deal is going ahead at some point in the next few days.Talks with the Americans have been ongoing since last year and originally a deal was expected to be done during the summer.When that didn’t happen, former chairman Stephen Thompson sold his majority stake to Martin and Fyffe in a deal that also involved investment from two other United-minded parties who preferred to remain anonymous.All along, though, Martin has insisted the discussions with the Americans have been progressing, albeit at a slower pace.Indications are they’re now complete and it is simply a matter of satisfying legal requirements before fans find out who will be leading their club for the foreseeable future."},{"url":null,"title":"shock as cops emerge with bags of stuff after swoop on dundee flat","story":"Police with snfer dogs smashed their way into a Dundee property in a raid yesterday.Two police cars, a police van and a dog unit were seen entering a flat on Pitarlie Road in Mid Craigie at around .am.Officers broke down the door of the flat and emerged from the address with large plastic bags which they carried to their marked vehicles.A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed officers were carrying out a search at the address, but was unable to say what the purpose of the raid was.One witness said several police appeared at a block of flats.She said: “I saw two police cars parked outside.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe success of independent retailers depends on imagination and initiative, and Lochgilphead shops will be showing plenty of that # and festive spirit # in the weeks leading up to Christmas.Lochgilphead is, arguably, seeing a mini-revival, with new businesses outnumbering closures in recent times.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"looking for that vital sale","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe puffer has become a familiar sight at Inveraray pier, but now the Vital Spark has been put up for sale.Owner of the vessel Archie MacArthur said on social media: #After  years of extensive and expensive works, I have decided to put the Vital Spark on the market now the hard work is all done.#Adding that the #potential is endless#, Mr MacArthur continued: #You#re not just buying a ship, you are buying into Scottish history and the world#s last privately-owned, commercially working puffer, VIC  Vital Spark.#In case you are interested, the asking price is £,."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us.

My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"britains-least-used-railway-station-revealed","story":"Britainrsquos least used railway station has been named as British Steel Redcar.Only  passengers used the North Yorkshire station in  , according to Office of Rail and Road figures.The coke ovens and blast furnace at the nearby SSI steel plant were shut down in  ndash leading to a drop in demand for the railway station ndash but there are still some people employed at the site.Just four Northern trains stop at the station each day between Monday and Saturday, two to Bishop Auckland and two to Saltburn.

been supporting Campbeltown Sailing Club throughout the inception and evolution of Kintyre Seasports SCIO.#We are very pleased to see the project move forward to the current position where a broad range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

I like having hair that looks like a volcano is erupting.However, despite its distinctive appeal, it has been suggested that the pale skin tone which often accompanies red hair may make people more susceptible to certain types of skin cancer.Redheads may also grow weary of peoples expectations that they have a fiery temperament, a myth based on folklore from many countries.It is thought that red hair appeared between , to , years ago, and that Neanderthals also had the MCR gene which makes it possible.Scientists have also suggested that woolly mammoths, which roamed the earth during the last ice age, were covered in ruddy red fur. based on tufts still found on frozen carcasses from Siberia.The Researchers looked at DNA from almost , people who had taken part in the UK Biobank study.The study focused on people of European descent because they have greater iation in hair colour.Comparing redheads to people with brown or black hair, they identied eight previously unknown genetic dferences that are associated with red hair.The team also looked at the s of the genes they identied and found that some of them work by controlling when MCR is switched on or off.In addition to the redhead genes, the researchers uncovered dferences in almost  genes associated with blondes and brunettes.Scientists say there is a gradient of colour from black, through dark brown to light brown and blonde, which is caused by increasing number of genetic dferences in these  genes.The researchers were surprised to find that many of these  genetic dferences were associated with hair texture rather than pigmentation.Others are involved in determining how the hair grows ndash such as whether curly or straight.Redhead Alex McLeishThe study, published in Nature Communications, was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.Professor Ian Jackson, of the Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh, said: ldquoWe were able to use the power of UK Biobank, a huge and unique genetic study of half a million people in Britain, which allowed us to find these effects.Professor Albert Tenesa, of the University of Edinburghrsquos Roslin Institute, added: ldquoWe are very pleased that this work has unravelled most of the genetic iation contributing to dferences in hair colour among people.Melanie Welham, Executive Chair of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, said that the breakthrough the study had been achieved through close collaboration between scientists.She said : ldquoOnce again collaborative research is helping to provide answers to some of lersquos important questions.\"BBSRC is pleased to have helped support the largest genetic study of human hair colour.

In future, though, I will not be quite so hasty to pass judgement.My first ndash and hopefully last ndash experience of refereeing a match came when I went to watch my eldest son play for his school team. As the game was about to kick-off it emerged no whistler had turned up. So I got tapped on the shoulder by one of the coaches and asked to step in to the breach.Now, it was hardly the second leg of the Copa Liberatadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate in the Bernabeu. It was a seven-a-side game between a bunch a  and -year-old boys on one third of an articial pitch in the suburbs of Glasgow. Nevertheless, it gave an eye-opening insight into the lot of the man-in-black.Who knew, for example, that determining which player touched the ball last in a   challenge and which team should subsequently be awarded a throw-in could be dficult  Having a linesman would have helped. But it was startling how something so seemingly straightforward could be so challenging.The reaction to many of my calls ndash indignation, outrage, tears, recrimination, disbelief ndash was also unexpected.Anyone who says that kids arenrsquot influenced by how high-profile professional players behave on television is, as Steve Clarke might well say, talking out of their backside.One particular objectionable urchin, who must have stood all of three feet tall in his studs, spent a couple of minutes after the game offering a less than complimentary appraisal of my performance. Apparently, for example, shouting isnrsquot allowed in boysrsquo football and is punishable by a free-kick. You learn something new every day.As for the spectators! Their conduct of the smattering of onlookers in what was effectively a kickabout left much to be desired. One especially joyless parent on the sidelines took time to inform me ldquothat was a blue ball after one of my dubious calls.

So that the  referendum was not on joining but, like the currently proposed plebiscite, on leaving. Taking into account the increased scope for widespread propaganda provided by modern technology and the well-developed sophistication of public relations, the - strategy, first for joining and then for remaining a member of the then EEC, provides a remarkable template for the Peoplersquos Vote campaign. This has been described as ldquoa huge operation run by dedicated staff and volunteers based on demonstrations, organised letter-writing, social media manipulation and a network of powerful interests ndash all strongly reminiscent of the earlier campaign, which similarly, though understandably, made no reference to the biased presentation of civil servants.In ,the Westminster Parliament was, as today, hopelessly ided irrespective of party regarding the advantages of membership of what is now the European Union and an ambitious campaign was launched to influence popular opinion ndash not in the interests of the great unwashed, but to engineer a comfortable majority in the House of Commons for Heathrsquos plan. Similarly the ldquoPeoplersquos Vote, having in itself no authority, is devised to influence the Westminster Parliament, which its supporters hope will persuade the Government into authorising a new referendum.In both cases a single driving force was needed to co-ordinate policy. Today Labour is by no means united on our relationship with the EU and it is a Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, who has co-ordinated pro-EU and related groups, as did the European Movement in . Even the funding of these two bodies was similar: in the year following March  the European Movement was able to distribute pound,, much of it from un-named donors, for EEC promotion finance for the Peoplersquos Vote campaign has been raised through crowd-funding.If Ian Blackford is so concerned about the accuracy of interpretation he should examine the backgrounds and interests of its leading proponents. ldquoPeople they undoubtedly are, but not in the sense that we are intended to understand by a ldquoPeoplersquos Vote. It would be at least more honest,not more accurate, to refer to a second referendum.Mary Rolls, Castlegate, Jedburgh.GIVEN the shambles that the Government is making of \"respecting the will of the British people\" and that it is very clear that there is no majority in Parliament for any decisive action, the question must be ed to the electorate for a final decision.Irsquove heard a lot of muddled thinking being espoused about how you achieve this.

Indeed, while accountancy giants EY and KPMG are the latest in a long line of experts to issue warnings about the potentially dire economic prospects facing both Scotland and the UKan orderly withdrawal cannot be agreed, the Federation of Small Businesses has found that ldquothe uncertainty and confusion associated with Brexit has brought Scottish business confidence to its lowest-ever ebb, with firms - for which read employers - north of the Border ldquoparticularly distressed about the current state of affairs.While that could have serious consequences for the jobs market, fears are growing about the impact Brexit could have on Scotlandrsquos cultural scene, which relies on international funding packages not to mention the free movement of people for its survival. Though Aberdeenshire-based arts director Claudia Zeiske has floated plans for a body that would help Scottish artists maintain ties with Europe following the UKrsquos departure, the organisation would rely on external funding to survive and we all know what happens to funding for the arts in times of economic stre.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough the pound, which has never recovered from the battering it took in the wake of the Brexit referendum, fell so low after Theresa May yesterday decided to postpone parliamentrsquos vote on her withdrawal plan that it is now essentially on an equal footing to both the dollar and the euro. Not only does that have serious consequences for trade, it makes a mockery of all that Brexit was supposed to achieve and brings cold comfort to anyone hoping to escape the gloom by indulging in a bit of winter sun. Quite where the pound will be when summer comes around is anyonersquos guess.Of course, just because the European court has said we can cancel Brexit does not mean that we will, with the case still to go back to the Court of Session for a final ruling. As the Scottish judges had sought their European colleaguesrsquo opinion in order to help them make their decision that may well turn out to be a formality, but even then cancelling the deal will in no way be a done deal. While the ECJ ruling has made clear that parliament can instruct the Government to halt the Brexit process, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg noted that the latter is unlikely to accept such instructions without a fight. ldquoThe only way to stay in the European Union is to legislate to do so, to reverse the Withdrawal Act, and that would require the Government to do a complete U-turn, he said soon after the judgment was handed down. And, though hersquoll have sent many hearts a-fluttering by adding that ldquothis government would find it very dficult to remain the governmentit went away from what it said in its manesto and the referendum result, the logical alternative - a change of regime - would not necessarily bring about a dferent result.Indeed, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is apparently itching to form a minority government should MPs vote to reject Mrs Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement, his long-held opposition to the European project would suggest that far from seeking to give up on Brexit he would instead look to make his own mark on it. Given how shambolic his Labour leadership has been, it can hardly be imagined that he will be able to magically deliver something better than the Prime Ministerrsquos wholly unsatisfactory deal - or that Mrs May will be able to negotiate some kind of improvement simply by delaying parliamentrsquos vote.Yet as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pointed out on Twitter, what the ECJ judgment does pave the way for is ldquoan extension of Article  to allow time for another vote, followed by revocation of Article the outcome is Remain. As we now know so much more about the implications of Brexit than we did when the first referendum was held, surely this is not only the most preferable route to go down but the fairest too.Wersquove known for some time that the economic consequences of leaving the EU will be far from favourable and the news on that front only seems to be getting worse. With the popular support for Brexit now being led by none other than Tommy Robinson - a man so extreme in his views that even yesterdayrsquos xenophobe Nigel Farage has distanced himself from him - the whole project has descended into farce. Thanks to the ECJ ruling, at the very least MPs can vote down the withdrawal agreement - in whatever form it may eventually take - safe in the knowledge that no-deal chaos does not have to ensue. It will hardly be an end in itself, but letrsquos hope they do just that."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-live-mps-hold-emergency-debate-over-deal-vote-delay","story":"• Theresa May begins EU tour, including emergency crunch talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel.• Westminster left in turmoil as Prime Ministers decision to cancel meaningful vote sparks fury among MPs"},{"url":null,"title":"council-approves-plans-for-700-build-to-rent-homes-in-glasgow","story":"Residential investor Get Living said its build-to-rent scheme will transform a derelict site behind High Street train station in Glasgow.:Wheatley secures funding for  new homesIt said that Glasgow City Council has approved plans which will enable the investment partnership behind Get Living PLC to invest poundm to build  new build-to-rent homes on the .-acre site.The scheme will feature a new public square,  student studios and around , sq m of space for retail, leisure, food and drink and commercial businesses.There will also be new tree-lined access routes on the site to connect the Merchant City through to the East End via High Street.Rick de Blaby, executive chairman of Get Living, said: ldquoWith a wealth of commercial developments in the city centre and on the waterfront of the river Clyde, it is an exciting time for Glasgow and it is fantastic to be able to say we are now a part of its ongoing revitalisation.:New homes plan for Newton Mearns given green lightldquoWe have listened carefully to the views of local businesses and the people of Glasgow in forming these ambitious plans.Other than a section currently used as a car park the site has lain vacant and derelict for many years.Developers said the Molendinar Burn, the original freshwater source upon which Glasgow was founded, passes under the site while the area was home to the University of Glasgow before it moved to the west end in the th century.Work on the first phase of the development is expected to start in , subject to securing a building warrant."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9075296.jpg?type=article-full","title":"jean-claude-juncker-there-is-no-room-whatsoever-for-brexit-renegotiation","story":"The President of the European CommissionJean-Claude Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: \"There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is roomused intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.\"This will not happen: everyone has to note that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened.\":Brexit live: Westminster fury as Theresa May cancels voteHe confirmed he would meet Mrs May on Tuesday evening but reiterated: \"The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible -

I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings. However, more recently windows on the higher first floor were also damaged. Vandalism of council property is a complete waste of council tax payers money as it erts council staff away from delivering the essential services that are required.\"Tuesday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118245.jpg","title":"Thurso musician sets tone for blockbuster","story":"A THURSO-born composer has taken a step back into medieval Scotland to create a unique score for a new multimillion-pound film about Robert the Bruce.Jim Sutherland, an award-winning composer who leads the eclectic mix of musicians that form La Banda Europa, created the \"diegetic soundtrack\" for Outlaw King which is launched globally on Netflix from next Friday.\"The diegetic soundtrack relates to all the sounds and background music playing in a scene and not the principal soundtrack,\" said Jim, who now lives in Auchtermuchty.For the job he did extensive research into what kind of music would be played by musicians in medieval Scotland and England.\"There is the music from the troubadours, minstrels and the ordinary people who sang songs of the time but there is very little evidence of what this was actually like.\"You have to make assumptions for a lot of it but I used as much evidence as I could from songs and music that were going on in Europe at that time.\"Diegetic music is part of the fictional setting and will be the music playing in a scene, such as from a minstrel who may be in shot, that will be heard by the characters on screen at that moment. Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Tuesday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118675.jpg","title":"Xmas hampers with a little muscle tow","story":"GYM owner Kris Hamilton will be flexing his biceps ahead of his annual sleigh pull from Thurso to Wick.Every year, Kris puts on his Santa Claus outfit and takes the role of the reindeer as he pulls a sleighful of hampers between the two towns.The hampers ndash which will be towed by Kris on December  ndash will be packed full of food, drink and clothing, and delivered to the elderly and some of the most vulnerable residents of Caithness.Its Kriss fth year at the helm, and while many applaud his fine efforts ndash the hampers being delivered to the east Caithness offices of NHS Highlands Care at Home services ndash they may well wonder why he takes on such an arduous task.Kris ndash who runs the Hamilton Optimum Training gym at Ackergill ndash says his motivation is clear.\"One moment of my pain could be a letime of happiness for somebody ,\" he says.\"Im effectively taking the role of the reindeer by pulling this sleigh ndash theyve got time off ahead of their main job on Christmas Eve ndash but its worth the effort.\"He stresses that at least hes got a sturdy sleigh to haul his good this year.\"The first year I did this I went from Thurso to Wick pulling a Tesco trolley full of goodies,\" he said.\"That was quite something as trolleys can be tricky to control in the shop let alone on the road.\"He underlined that the episode served as a good advertisement for Tesco, as it showed how strong its trolleys are.\"We average around  hampers ndash although were aiming for  ndash and were appealing for people to gather and donate as much food, drink and clothing as possible, as it can really light up someone less fortunates Christmas.\"If people are in a position to give, then they can donate what they can to myself at the gym in Ackergill.\"Kris is no stranger to fundraising as earlier this year he got down and dirty as he battled \"the Beast\".He added: \"The Beast Race is an annual km obstacle course race set around the banks of Loch Ness.\"The obstacles being mud, hills, marshes and climbing walls.

Say no thanks and move away.” - Hollywood star Tilda Swinton battles locals over plans for her Highland homeTodayShropshire Coroner John Ellery concluded Vicki died as a result of suicide.He said: “Victoria had made two previous attempts to take her own le in the past and suffered from depression.“Victoria left her radio show in mid-air and she said she was going for a break.“My conclusion is Victoria did do the act that led to her death.“She intended to kill herself, and that leads me to the inevitable conclusion of suicide.“This is a tragic case for her family and our condolences are and must be with her children.”The a statement read to the court, Mr Holyoake described the heartbreaking moment he found his step-daughter’s body.He said: “At approximately pm on August , [Vicki’s mother] Beryl and I called at her house to give her a necklace. I was gong to fix the cooker.“Beryl said she was eating well and she appeared her usual chatty self.“She is a radio presenter and she is at work from .pm to pm.“I made arrangements to fix her cooker while she was at work.“We left and at .pm and I went back to her house.“When I was approaching the house, I saw a female approach her driveway.“She had white hair and a long dress, similar to Victoria.“As I was driving past the house I saw the back of the person going towards the door.“When I was approaching the house I was expecting to see the person at the door.“I found the key was missing from the key safe by the door.“I knocked the door and there was no reply. - Irvine Welsh’s Edinburgh housing estate to host pop-up book festival“I started to get annoyed because the person who went into the house did not come.“I phoned my we to let her know.

We went to Radio Shropshire.“One of Victoria’s colleagues told me Victoria had left work at pm and said she was feeling upset and would be in work tomorrow.“Alarm bells started to ring.“Victoria has made two previous attempts to take her own le and suffers from depression.“We went to her house and continued to try and raise her by banging the doors and windows but there was still no reply.“We had tohome and I went alone back to her house with a key for her door.“I saw Victoria’s car parked on Buttington Road. This is unusual as she normally parks on the driveway.“I couldn’t get the key into the door because there was a key on the other side.“I noticed Victoria’s bedroom window was open and I managed to get a ladder from one of her neighbours.“I got in through the bedroom window.“There were no signs of forced entry in the house. I searched the house and garden but could not find her.“I called my we to come and assist me. She said to check the loft.“I went to the top of the stairs and the loft hatch was closed as normal.“As I checked the right hand side of the loft, I saw Victoria in the corner.“I went downstairs to phone an ambulance. I also asked for police.“The emergency services operator started to give me instructions to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation .“As I did this, the ambulance arrived.“The paramedic pronounced le extinct when he arrived.”A statement from PC Matthew Bourne, of West Mercia Police, said: “At .pm on August  there was a report from a man who had found his daughter hanging in the attic.“When we arrived there was a distressed female who I now know is Beryl Holyoake.“Lee Holyoake was in a distressed state, attempting CPR on a female.“She was on her back.“I could see the female was not moving.“The paramedic pronounced le extinct at .pm.“Shropshire Fire and Rescue attended to remove the body.”The inquest heard Vicki had a blood alcohol level slightly over the drink drive limit as well as some traces of medication in her blood.But the post-mortem examination suggested alcohol and drugs did not play a part in her death.Dr Joanna Stafford, who carried out the post mortem at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital on August , said: No alcohol or drugs were implicated in the death.“The cause of death was hanging.”A statement released by Vicki’s family said: “We still cannot believe that Vicki’s not here.“Her zest for le was infectious, she was a wonderful mother and daughter and her charm brought a smile to all those who knew her.“She could light up a room.“While we will always miss her we want to remember and celebrate everything that she achieved which is why in the spring we are planning a memorial celebration of her le.“But in the meantime we want to thank everyone for their support and kindness helping us through our immeasurable loss.”Gavin Hogarth, Vicki’s ex-husband and the father of her children, attended the inquest but did not wish to comment outside court.David Jennings, Head of the BBC’s regional programmes, West Midlands, said in a statement afterwards: “We are heartbroken at Vicki’s death.“Everyone here at Radio Shropshire respected her as a great presenter and journalist, but so much more than that we loved the sense of fun she brought to her shows and the station.“Her loss leaves a huge void.

Some of the legal advice that the Government then chose to ignore has exposed the deal’s real weaknesses – which, crucially, are far more than the Irish Protocol known as the backstop.Of real concern must also be the failure of Theresa May’s government to show that it has made a serious effort to prepare for No Deal. Those two counts – losing a vote over her flagship policy and leaving the country ill-prepared to face an economic risk – are capital offences that would normally warrant removal from office. It should be remembered that in  the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain actually won a vote of confidence following the failure of the Norwegian campaign yet he knew he no longer had moral or political authority and resigned with dignity. Theresa May must also resign to maintain any degree of political respect, andshe does not she should be subject to a vote of confidence within her parliamentary party, for that is the only way to replace her with someone who can get down to the task of preparing the country for leaving without a deal while trying to get the EU to compromise.A vote of no confidence put forward by Labour would most likely fail, as the DUP would not wish to bring down the governing party in favour of Jeremy Corbyn – and recalcitrant Tory MPs would also fall into line rather than be responsible for the fall of the government and the calling of an early general election. So it must be down to backbenchers to submit their letters to trigger the Conservative Party’s own procedures. At that point I would expect the likes of Jeremy Hunt and Savid Javid to tell the Prime Minister it was time to step aside or face humiliation from her own colleagues.There is much talk for May being given one last chance in Brussels this week and thatshe can get a time limit on the Irish Protocol or other such fix that allows the UK to claim a minor victory then her deal could then pass. This would be a foolish and dangerous approach, for even without the backstop the deal is not Brexit. It would still tie the UK into many Single Market rules overseen by the European Courts of Justice and throw away £ billion for nothing in . Countries like South Korea and Canada make no contribution to access the EU’s markets and the House of Lords found there was no obligation to pay the EU £bn.A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure to meet, Simon Boyd, the Scottish CEO of Reid Steel. Simon, who served his apprenticeship in a Clyde shipyard, explained to me how the company he runs, which exports to some  countries around the world, was originally established in France in  – but is now located in Dorset. Yet despite this pedigree and the existence of the so-called Single Market he finds it easier to export steel to Mongolia than he does to France. He gave me two examples of why the first was when his company had a UK Government contract to build storage facilities at Calais, and the second was for a £.M aircraft hangar in Toulouse – but Reid Steel could not do either because it is not a French company. In France only French companies can buy the insurances needed to work in their country. Those insurances also require that all materials have been approved by the French testing authorities, making it more dficult for UK manufactured goods.Far from creating a level playing field like the single market Scotland enjoys across the whole of the United Kingdom, the EU has rigged the game rampant protectionism is the only winner – and this state of affairs is what the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to maintain.Boyd also explained to me how the EU’s Eurocodes system for design unormity ensures each dferent country, and in some cases dferent regions, have their own local ‘annexes’ or conditions. Often they are in native languages and are simply a means to tie up competition in a tangle of prohibitive and costly red tape. Businesses have to purchase Eurocodes from the British Standards Institute, which is a signicant overhead and can be a barrier to entry for many SMEs. To purchase just one part of the Eurocodes for Reid Steel’s type of work costs circa £,, and that is for just one of the  parts of the codes that relate to their industry. For an SME like Reid Steel these overheads are burdensome,not completely unaffordable.As a further example Boyd told me of how Reid Steel designed and helped build  structures in the Caribbean, all designed to British Standards . Every single one stood up to the category five hurricanes last year. Boyd doubted Reid Steel would have been able to win that work using Eurocodes as the use of Eurocodes internationally is rare.The UK needs to be free from the EU’s bureaucratic restraints of the Single Market, Customs Union and the jurisdiction of the ECJcompanies like Reid Steel are to maintain their global reach and grow. The Withdrawal Agreement is a bad deal – with or without the Backstop – and on Tuesday MPs need to take the brave pills and defeat it to ensure a real Brexit can be delivered by setting up the chance for a better deal.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841571.1544428298!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch norway plus is not an option for the uk s brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Amber Rudd and her colleagues are deluding themselves with their Brexit plan B, writes Lesley RiddochScots stand today, surveying the collapse of British governance, like folk on leboats watching the mighty Titanic start to slip beneath the waves.Most of us do not vote Conservative and never will. Most of us voted to Remain in the EU in . And now most of us would opt for independence in the EUa self-harming Brexit goes ahead. And no matter which withdrawal deal is advocated by desperate members of both main political parties south of the Border, each one is more damaging than simply staying in the EU. That includes Amber Rudd’s crazy, last gasp advocacy of “Norway-plus” as a Brexit option,or really when Theresa May’s dead duck is finally allowed to waddle off the stage. Of course, on the face of it, Norway-plus looks inviting. The UK was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Associationin . Britain left to join the EEC in , so EFTA membership could be portrayed as ato the fold we should never have left. Rejoining EFTA would let the UK remain inside the European single market by also gaining eligibility to join the European Economic Areaand that would guarantee genuinely frictionless trade.Britain would leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, the common agricultural and fisheries policies and be free of the drive towards “ever closer union” from the end of . And the “plus” bit – remaining in a temporary customs union – would allow goods to join services enjoying business asnormal instead of the impending chaos of a no-deal Brexit.But the price is high, especially for a party which consciously decided to follow the irresponsible and malicious path of blaming Brussels, EU nationals and immigrants for the Dickensian levels of poverty, inequality, starvation, collapse of public services and general hopelessness created by their own policies in Britain. There is therefore no way the Tories can sell a Norway-plus deal which accepts freedom of movement and “rule-taking” from Brussels while paying - per cent of full membership fees to feverishly Brexit-ready English voters. Of course, there’s another tiny problem with the Norway-plus option. Norway will block it.Last week, Heidi Nordby Lunde, Conservative MP and president of Norway’s European Movement, kicked British membership of the EFTA roundly into touch, telling Channel : “I’m sceptic to letting the UK into the EFTA family because it’s kind of like having an abusive partner spiking the drinks and inviting them to the Christmas party.”When askedshe felt that the potential of Britain joining the EFTA would upset the balance in that group, she added: “I think you would mess it all up for us, the way you have messed it up for yourselves.”This kind of reality check has so far been completely missing from Britain’s pie-in-the-sky Brexit debate and is all the more signicant because Norwegians are usually the world’s most diplomatic people – the product of compromise and consensus that comes from almost a century using PR in elections.But Lunde summed up Britain’s Norway-plus problems succinctly: “The Norway deal has four issues that I don’t think UK politicians want. First of all, we accept migration internally in the EU, we also accept rulings by the European Court of Justice, we accept the rules and regulations that we get from the EU. Also, being in the EFTA bloc, we can’t make our own free trade agreements without having Liechtenstein and Iceland with us.”Interestingly, none of these obstacles for “red line” Britain would create an insuperable barrier to an independent Scotland which wanted to pursue the EFTA EEA routeEFTA members and Scots decided that was preferable to full EU membership. But after this one short interview on Friday, Norway-plus stood roundly demolished as an option for Britain. Yet, unbelievably, the very next day, flying in the face of all that had just been said, Rudd became the first Cabinet minister to publicly back the Norway-plus modelMay’s Brexit deal is defeated in the Commons tomorrow. Even more incredibly, Rudd’s desperate advocacy of this non-viable Norway deal propelled the Work and Pensions Secretary back up the pollsters’ rankings in the race to become the next Tory leader. Mind you, since the attempt to keep legal advice from MPs also shunted Attorney General Geoffrey Cox into the running, why should anyone be surprised  Despite defeat in the Commons, Tory MPs and London-based political commentators were apparently moved and impressed by the gravelly, authoritative quality of his voice. These are the depths to which “leadership” in British politics has sunk.In short, a proposal that was comprehensively trashed only  hours earlier by a Norwegian Conservative politician has earned the deluded or deliberately obfuscating Rudd an even greater chance of taking over when May has gone.If folk believe this bourach can still be described as governance, they must be part of the minority – according to weekend surveys of Scottish public opinion – that still prefers Brexit in the UK to Scottish independence in Europe. You don’t have to be a card-carrying Christian for a verse of Matthew to come to mind: “Beware of  prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. By their fruits you will know them.”Well, now all Scots know how the Conservative Party and the British Government choose to operate. They are always focused on the short term, always seeking one-off deals instead of long-term relationships, always feathering their own nests – recent European investments by leading Brexiteers haven’t escaped public attention – and always suspicious or careless of neighbours’ interests. It’ll be a very long time before the Irish forget Priti Patel’s appalling suggestion that the prospect of food shortages should be used to scare Irish people into submission over the backstop. Of course, Scots are not immune from Brexit or its ill effects.But looked at from the perspective of those boarding the leboat north of the Border today, there’s only one question left as Britain embarks on its final act of jaw-dropping self-harm.

I’ve only ever had a good sighting of one once – on the dunes at Coul Links in east Sutherland back in . Though I didn’t know it at the time, the animal I saw was unlikely to have been a pure-bred wildcat, despite displaying all the physical characteristics of the species, including a wonderfully bushy tail. It’s highly likely it was a hybrid between a domestic cat and the ancestors of the European wildcats that colonised Britain , years ago by crossing the ice which then connected us to the continent.Like many other species, wildcats have suffered a precipitous decline in numbers over several centuries due to a combination of habitat destruction and persecution. By the end of the th century, Victorian hunters had exterminated wildcats in England and Wales and only a few were hanging on in northern Scotland. In the th century, hunting reduced somewhat but by now the remaining wildcats had begun to breed with domestic cats creating a new race of hybrids.: ‘Enormous’ wildcat caught on camera in Aberdeenshire forestThis history of hybridisation makes the design of a conservation plan for the species a big challenge. Most, possibly all, purportedly ‘wild’ wildcats are to a greater or lesser extent a blend of domestic and wild genes. This raises a question. What are we conserving and why  If most or all are now hybrids, one approach could be to set a ‘percentage pure’ cut-off and try to focus on saving those that pass the test. To do this, however, will involve an awful lot of trapping and genetic testing. Another obvious problem is deciding on the percentage in the first place. Let’s say the cut-off is  per cent and a test result comes in for a given cat at  per cent – does this mean that inidual has no conservation value As complex and morally tricky as wildcat conservation is, there is a carefully thought through national plan which, in the long term, could see wildcats thrive again above the Highland fault line. The plan is being led by Scottish Wildcat Action, a partnership of  organisations, including my own, the Scottish Wildle Trust. It aims to save the wildcat by implementing a portfolio of actions underpinned by the best available science. : Wildcat kittens born at Edinburgh Zoo could provide ‘lele’ for the speciesThe partnership team has been working with local people in five priority areas – Strathbogie, Angus glens, northern Strathspey, Morvern and Strathpeffer – to reduce the risks of hybridisation, disease and accidental persecution whilst also gathering extensive data to improve our understanding of the species. It has also been improving habitat in places like Clashindarroch Forest, where sensitive forestry operations are creating ideal wildcat habitat with mosaics of open ground – often rich in prey such as field voles – in combination with denser plantation woodland.All of these actions will help but they are unlikely to be enough on their own. This is why Scottish Wildcat Action is also considering reinforcing remaining populations with wildcats bred in a conservation breeding programme being led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. In time,combined with trap-neuter-release schemes for feral cats, reinforcement could reverse the degree of hybridisation and help create self-sustaining breeding populations across large areas of the northern Highlands. We shouldn’t pretend that achieving such a vision will be easy, but we must surely try. The future of the ‘Highland tiger’ is in our hands.Jonny Hughes is chief executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints.

This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1295009.jpg--.jpg?1544181922000\n","title":"new york concert date for kells flautist","story":"A Kells teenager has been selected to join the prestigious National Youth Orchestra.Jake Houston has been playing the flute for eight years and is set to take his place in the world’s greatest orchestra of teenagers in December.The -year-old will join  other teenagers from all over the country as part of the Youth Orchestra, which is also planning its first ever tour to the USA in .The members of the orchestra were selected following  days of auditions held in  cities across the country.

The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

The draw of playing with her friends a few metres away is just too much for her.“She loves to be involved in everything,# says Clotilde, #especially helping to prepare food and cook. She#s quick to learn.#The proud mum of four is thankful that Ines and her other children are growing up strong and healthy. She puts it down to a combination of a ied and nutritious diet and the help and advice of community-based health workers, carers and volunteers supported by international development charity Concern Worldwide.Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, where more than a third of the population don’t have enough food to eat. Poverty, political instability and scarce rainfall all contribute to high levels of food insecurity and hunger. And children, who make up around half the population, are disproportionately affected.What makes it even more of a challenge is that Clotilde and her family live in Cibitoke – an area with one of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition in the country. Every other child living there is chronically malnourished.Hunger prevents them from developing. It causes stunting and weakens their immune systems making them more susceptible to diseases. Their ability to grow and learn is permanently damaged. By the time they are two-years-old, the effects of chronic malnutrition are irreversible.The overall level of acute malnutrition in the area is also poor, with one in every  children moderately or severely malnourished. Last year, the UN estimated that as many as . million children in Burundi were impacted, with almost , under-fives requiring treatment for severe malnutrition.It is for that reason that aid agencies like Concern are targeting pregnant women, and mums with young children. The aim is to prevent malnutrition in the first place or spot the early signs before it takes hold.A few kilometres away, we meet another -year-old mum, Charlotte Nzeyimana. She has been walking for almost two hours carrying baby Keddy on her back and with four-year-old daughter Kyntia by her side.In the shade of a banana grove, Charlotte shares her concerns about young Kyntia, who sits motionless on the ground beside her. “My daughter is not very healthy,” she says.Seven months ago little Kyntia was diagnosed with oedema – a symptom of severe acute malnutrition. She was admitted to hospital and recovered after a month. But her situation remains precarious.“I breastfed her until she was three-years-old,# says Charlotte. #After that, she began to get sick. She has never had a ied diet – and has only ever eaten cassava paste.#In the next few weeks, though, Charlotte will begin to reap the benefits of the same vital health and nutrition advice and support that Clotilde enjoys.The programme, which started in July, is run by Concern with funding from the UK government. Last year, as part of the overseas charity’s Food in a Fragile World appeal, the public donated just over £, which was matched pound-for-pound by the government. That matched funding is now being used in this part of Burundi to help improve the lives of more than , under-fives at risk of malnutrition.At the heart of Concern#s efforts to tackle hunger is a team of  skilled Community Health Workers . They are trained to detect the early signs of malnutrition on the spot and treat certain illnesses and infections. Concern also supports , Care Group Volunteers and  Mother Leaders who promote breastfeeding and good nutrition, food preparation and hygiene practices.#We rely on our Community Health Worker,# says Clotilde. #She has treated my children for malaria and diarrhoea. Andthey fall sick again, she will know what to do.#Both Clotilde and her husband earn what they can from casual work cultivating cassava and corn. Between harvests and during lean times they sell eggs, buns, soap and home-made banana juice to friends and neighbours. It is enough for them to survive on.#The CHW has told us the importance of having a balanced diet,” she says. “We eat twice a day – mostly beans, corn, rice, cassava paste, sweet potatoes and vegetables.”On a steep hillside in Bukinanyana not far from where we met Charlotte, Community Health Worker Jeannette Icimanishatse is greeted by shouts and laughter. The -year-old grandmother is visiting one of ten households on her weekly rounds. It is clear that she has gained the trust and respect of her neighbours, encouraging them to take simple preventative measures to positively impact their children’s lives.“I am proud of what I do,” says Jeanette. “Mums depend on us for help. It is rewarding to know that we are doing something to make the le of the community better.”Community Health Workers like Jeannette refer any cases of severe acute malnutrition to the local health centre for specialist treatment. They even help to arrange transport and encourage mums to save a little for emergencies. Mothers whose children are moderately malnourished are enrolled in community-based nutrition demonstrations where they receive advice on key feeding and care practices. They are also given support to build a kitchen garden which enables them to have vegetables all year round, and an opportunity to be part of a savings and loans scheme.It is a highly effective approach, according to Sebastien Sebahizi, Concern’s Health and Nutrition Programme Manager in Cibitoke, because it focuses on behaviour change and peer-to-peer communication.“What we have observed,” he says, “is that some mothers in exactly the same living conditions have children who are healthy. We bring them into the programme as Mother Leaders and Care Group Volunteers, so that mums who are struggling can spend time with them and see how it’s done.”A further spin-off from tackling malnutrition at grassroots level is that less of a strain is placed on the therapeutic and stabilisation services provided by local clinics.“What we hope to achieve,” says Sebastien, “is to halve the number of childhood nutrition-related consultations in local health centres. That will ease the pressure on the system and enable medical staff to deal with more complicated cases.“But ultimately, our goal is to reduce childhood malnutrition and give more young children the opportunity to grow up healthy and well. It is something each one of them deserves.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"food bank demand in north belfast soars for yet another christmas","story":"THE demand for food for those in need this Christmas is as high as ever before after another tough year for many people in North Belfast.A year of drastic changes to welfare reform and the roll-out of the controversial universal credit in November has left more and more people in need of essential food products over the upcoming Christmas period.The annual drive by North Belfast Advice Partnership and Ligoniel Improvement Association is now on for donations for this year’s initiative to help local families across North Belfast.Sinead McKinley, who is helping co-ordinating this year’s food drive, said this year’s appeal is their most important ever.“This year once again we have been inundated with requests for food parcels and Christmas hampers,” she explained.“It has been a really tough year for families, with all the dferent changes to welfare policy on top of the higher cost of food and living generally and the uncertainty around Brexit, it means more people are in food poverty.“Utility bills are also getting higher yet benefits have been frozen for four years.“There is also the cruel Universal Credit which I believe has resulted mainly in an increased demand for the food bank.“People are on a five-week wait for the changeover in their benefits which has put them in debt coming up to Christmas. There is no mitigation payment for that crossover period because the Assembly collapsed before they could pass the legislation.”Started in , the local food bank drive resulted in a record number of people receiving hampers last Christmas, with a total of  hampers delivered to iniduals and families in need.Once again, Sinead is appealing for long-le food products, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and festive toys and gts amongst the vital donations for this year’s appeal.“We want to build on last year’s successful food bank drive success which resulted in  Christmas hampers delivered to those in need.“This year we expect the demand to be much higher and we will continue to work with our partners in St Vincent de Paul, St Patrick’s Soup Kitchen, Haven Outreach and Oasis Food Bank on the Shankill to meet demand.“We want to maximise resources to support a bigger group of people. Food is always the priority – it frees up other money for them to pay bills and spend a few pounds at Christmas time.“Christmas hampers are vital so that local families get through the festive period. There are extra costs because more people are off and stay at home which means extra heating bills.“This year has been so tough for everyone, especially low-paid workers, those on benefits and those affected by universal credit.“It has been really bad.Unfortunately, it is a sign of the times that food banks will become the norm for so many people.“Universal Credit is so cruel and will continue to roll out to so many more people. Soup kitchens and homeless charities are a leline for people. It is a helping hand for people.“I would appeal to local people to once again support this year’s food bank appeal- people in North Belfast are so generous when it comes to donating at Christmas.”Items can be donated to this year’s Food Bank appeal by bringing them to the Wolfhill Centre in Ligoniel, or they can be dropped into a number of other community centres including Ardoyne Association , Ashton Centre , Tar Isteach , Vine Centreand Ballysillan Community Forum ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcgurks first uvf target searched 48 hours","story":"THE bar that the UVF had intended to blow up before switching their sights to McGurk’s had been raided two nights earlier by the British army and patrons arrested and screened.Fteen civilians, including two children, were killed in the North Queen Street bar massacre on December  .Ciarán MacAirt, a grandson of two of the victims, unearthed the informationin secret military documents in the National Archives in London. This week marks the th anniversary of the atrocity.At pm on December ,  – two days before the McGurk’s attack, British soldiers of the nd Battalion Royal Regiment Fusiliersraided and searched the Gem Bar close to McGurk’s Bar on North Queen Street.Less than  hours later, loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Forcetargeted the Gem Bar for a major bomb attack. The Gem Bar was suspected by the British Army of being frequented by members of the Official IRA.The one convicted bomber, Robert James Campbell, confessed that the UVF gang drove to the area to attack the Gem Bar.It is believed that they could not plant the bomb there as young men were outside the bar so the bombers drove around the corner and pulled up beside the side entrance of McGurk’s Bar instead. One of the bombers got out of the car and placed the bomb in the entranceway, lit the fuse and ran back to the car which then sped off down Great George’s Street.Ciarán MacAirt said: “It is horric to contemplate that the British Army believed that the Gem Bar was frequented by members and supporters of the Official IRA and had raided the bar, searched it and screened its customers before lting a half dozen men. The action resulting from these lts is redacted in the files. Then, two nights later, pro-state loyalist extremists targeted the Gem Bar but failed to get clear access so made the fateful decision to attack the soft target of McGurk’s Bar instead.“We also know from these files, contrary to what the police and Office of the Police Ombudsman reported to our families, the British Army within an hourhad linked the Gem Bar to the bomb attack as the files record that McGurk’s Bar “was close to the Gem Bar” – but the British Army’s description of the Gem Bar is withheld from the families even after  years after the atrocity.“I believe the redacted information records that the Gem Bar was a ‘Goulding’ bar which in British military parlance denoted its alleged affiliation to the Official IRA whose leader at the time was Cathal Goulding. The reason that it is redacted could be that it shows that the British Army had correctly considered the Gem Bar to have been the target and the bombers loyalists. This alone would undermine the botched investigations our families have endured until now.“We also know from the same file that a British Army bomb expert had reported that the seat of the explosion was clearly in the entranceway and not inside the bar as the police had lied to the public, so the bar was attacked as witnesses had testied. Finally, from this signicant new discovery, we now know for a fact that the British Army’s covert death-squad, the Military Reaction Force, was operating in the area with  RRF who had raided the Gem Bar and we had long suspected that it had facilitated and directed the bombers.”Niall Ó Murchú of Kinnear and Co. Solicitors is legal representative for many of the McGurk’s Bar families. He added: “With every piece of new evidence which a family member had to find, it is becoming increasingly clear that the British army was involved in the planning and targeting of this bomb attack. “To allay all suspicion, we challenge Chief Constable George Hamilton and Police Ombudsman Michael Maguire to retrieve this file and release the information that the British Ministry of Defence is withholding from the families  years later.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37610293.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/graph.jpg","title":"survey reveals 65 in northern ireland would now vote remain and 60 think united ireland more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"university of ulster graduations monday december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jonathan Bell: I was disparaged and demonised just for telling the truth about my role in RHI scandal The RHI probe, which is led by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, will hear closing submissions over three days from tomorrow. This will include a short presentation of the evidence already heard over  days, as well as oral submissions from lawyers representing three key players - the Department for the Economy, the Department of Finance and regulator Ofgem.Oral submissions will also be heard from some of the  iniduals and organisations who were granted enhanced participatory rights. These include Mrs Foster, former DUP minister Jonathan Bell, a number of the partys special advisersand some senior civil servants.Mrs Foster was in charge of the Stormont department that set up the flawed scheme.As details of the scandal emerged later, she faced calls to stand down as First Minister. When she refused to step aside, Sinn Fein collapsed the Executive in January .The public inquiry has since exposed internal rows between senior DUP members and the power wielded by unelected Spads, as well as how codes that set standards for public le were apparently ignored routinely to get business done.In a closing statement to the inquiry, during which Mrs Foster gave five days of evidence, her lawyer said it will be up to the  to determine the impact of a \"lack of ministerial input\" on certain key issues.Mrs Foster, who launched the RHI scheme in  when Enterprise Minister, previously admitted to the inquiry that she did not read the legislation she introduced to the Assembly in her name.She also said that she was \"accountable but not responsible\" for her former Spad Dr Andrew Crawford.Mrs Foster said Dr Crawford never raised allegations that the RHI scheme was being abused with her, or the potential for a spike in applications. She told the inquiry she now believes both of those issues should have been brought to her attention when she was Finance Minister in .In her statement last night, Ms Ellison said Mrs Foster had been \"clear that she is accountable to the Assembly for the failings that occurred within Deti during her tenure as minister of that department\". \"She has welcomed the inquiry as a means of establishing the facts of what went wrong with the scheme and how to ensure it does not happen again. \"It is clear, however, that there were many issues that were not raised to ministerial level for either information or decision-making. \"It will be for the inquiry to determine the impact the lack of ministerial input on certain key issues has had, and whether, in light of the issues that were not raised, Mrs Foster was in a position to have done anything dferently such that the schemes adverse outcomes could have been avoided.\"At the DUPs annual conference last month, Mrs Foster said her party was \"deeply, deeply, sorry\" for its handling of the RHI scandal, which saw the Northern Ireland taxpayer open to a huge overspend because the scheme paid out more in subsidies than the cost of the fuel, leading to a \"burn-to-earn\" incentive.Last night her barrister repeated Mrs Fosters apology \"for the mistakes made\" by her party in the handling of the failed green energy scheme and that the RHI crisis has been the former First Ministers \"biggest regret both politically and personally\"."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal to return to commons before january 21 says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But he offered a glimmer of hope to Mrs May by saying there was room to give “further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker addressed MEPs in Strasbourg The delay to the so-called “meaningful vote” by MPs means that ratication may not be possible until as late as  weeks before the scheduled date of Brexit on March . But Mrs May’s spokesman insisted she continues to believe that necessary preparations can be completed within that time.The Prime Minister held talks over breakfast with her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte in The Hague, which Downing Street described as “constructive”.Mrs May told the Dutch PM that “additional assurances” would be needed on the backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexitthe deal was to get through Parliament.“The leaders agreed that the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary, the Prime Minister set out the concerns held by many about it in the UK,” said her spokesman.“She discussed the need for additional assurances on this point in order for the deal with the EU to pass the House of Commons. The Prime Minister and Prime Minister Rutte agreed to work together to find a way through.Mrs May then flew on to Berlin for a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and was due to travel later in the day to Brussels for talks with Mr Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk.The weekly Tuesday morning Cabinet meeting was postponed because of Mrs May’s travels and will now be held on Wednesday afternoon, when preparations for a no-deal Brexit will be on the agenda.Mrs May will thento Brussels on Thursday for the two-day European Council summit, though it was unclear whether she would be invited to join leaders of the other  member states when they discuss Brexit. Mrs May’s move to abandon a crunch Commons vote, scheduled for Tuesday, on her Brexit deal drew howls of condemnation from the opposition as well as a number of Tories.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leading Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker suggested that that PM had a “duty” to stand down in order for a new leader to deliver EU withdrawal.“What I would like to happen today is for Conservative Members of Parliament to realise that we simply cannot go staggering forward any longer like this and I’m afraid to put their letters of no confidence in,” Mr Baker told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.But Mrs May’s spokesman responded: “The Prime Minister believes it is her duty to deliver on the will of the British people and take us out of the EU.”Askedthe PM continued to have full confidence in chief whip Julian Smith, the spokesman replied: “Yes.”Mr Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is roomused intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.I will meet @theresa_may this evening in Brussels. I remain convinced that the #Brexit deal we have is the best - and only - deal possible. There is no room for renegotiation, but further clarications are possible.— Jean-Claude JunckerDecember , “This will not happen: everyone has to note that the Withdrawal Agreement will not be reopened.”He confirmed he would meet Mrs May on Tuesday evening but reiterated: “The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible – it is the only deal possible.”It came as Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom suggested Mrs May was seeking changes that would give Parliament an additional “democratic ability to decide”.“That might include an addendum to the Withdrawal Agreement that sets out that Parliament will vote prior to going into a backstop, should that prove necessary, and potentially that the EU Parliament and UK Parliament must vote every year thereafter to provide that legitimacy for the UK to stay in the backstop, should that prove necessary,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“So there are plenty of options for the PM to talk to the EU about that don’t involve reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but that would provide the legal text as a part of the Withdrawal Agreement, through perhaps an addendum.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May is facing repeated calls from leading Tory Brexiteers to be replaced as PM Downing Street declined to be drawn on the specic form of reassurance being sought by the PM, saying only that she needed to be sure that it was something which would satisfy MPs.As anger at Westminster continued to fester over the PM’s move to cancel the Brexit vote, MPs were poised for an emergency debate on the situation called by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on the day the “meaningful vote” was initially scheduled to take place."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37614317.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/a-3-_2_-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"honorary degree for bike ace jonathan rea","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Bradley said she fully supported the Prime Ministers decision, but said the deal was still in the best interests of Northern Ireland.\"The deal protects our precious Union with the  Belfast Agreement, and the consent principle at its heart, fully maintained. \"That is the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and this Government will always uphold it,\" Mrs Bradley said.\"The deal ensures that there will be no customs border down the Irish Sea, with free and unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods and services into its most important market, Great Britain.\"She said the withdrawal agreement offered \"huge gains... for those of us who believe strongly in the Union\".And she warned: \"I am convinced that leaving the EU without an agreement would be disastrous for Northern Ireland and potentially for the long-term future of the Union. \"I am not prepared to take risks with or gamble the Union of the United Kingdom.\" Earlier the Prime Minister suggested that a united Ireland could move dramatically closerthe backstop is removed from the Brexit deal.In a warning that caused signicant surprise in Dublin, Mrs May openly admitted that voters in Northern Ireland may want to join the Republic rather than see border posts re-erected.\"Businesses operate across that border. People live their lives crossing and recrossing it every day,\" she said.\"Ive been there and spoken to some of those people. They do not want their everyday lives to change as a result of the decisions we have taken.\"They do not want ato a hard border. Andthis House cares about preserving our Union, it must listen to those people because our Union will only endure with their consent.\"An Irish Government source said: \"We have been very careful not to talk about a united Ireland during this, so to hear it from the British Prime Minister was extraordinary.\"On another day of shambolic politics in Westminster, the Prime Minister delayed todays so-called meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement and vowed to seek further reassurances from the EU on how the backstop will work.Mrs Mays U-turn came after she and senior ministers had spent days insisting the vote would go ahead despite the scale of opposition.Her statement to MPs is also a clear signal that her relationship with the DUP, who had been propping up her Government, is all but over.Addressing the Commons, the PM accepted that there was \"widespread and deep concern\" among MPs over the backstop, designed to keep the border openthe EU and UK fail to strike a wider trade deal. But she insisted that there was \"no deal available that does not include the backstop\". Mrs May is now expected to canvass EU leaders in a bid to secure additional reassurances for MPs on the backstop. It is believed she is seeking a declaration of sorts on the backstop which would underline its temporary nature in an effort to win over critics in the Commons.She will hold crisis talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel today and will meet Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague. In her statement to MPs, Mrs May also said the Government was stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, despite saying that this would cause \"signicant economic damage to parts of our country\".

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland ranked as worst in eu for tackling climate change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

LIVE NOW: @NASAVoyager  launched before its twin in , but followed a longer path away from Earth. Along the way, Voyager  has been providing scientists with unprecedented observations of the space it’s traveling through. Get the latest now: https:t.co nDQWMiHMS #AGU pic HwTKHEaY— NASADecember , The spacecraft is beyond the outer boundary of the heliosphere,  billion miles from Earth.It is trailing twin Voyager , which reached interstellar space in  and is  billion miles from Earth. Interstellar space is the vast emptiness between star systems.Even though they are out of the sun’s bubble, the Voyagers are still technically in our solar system, Nasa said. Scientists maintain the solar system stretches to the outer edge of the so-called Oort Cloud. It will take about , years for the spacecraft to get that far.With todays @NASAVoyager  news, you might be wondering: just where is the edge of our celestial neighborhood  This illustrated introduction to our solar system shows that it all depends on how you look at it. Watch: https:t.co esDgrndVM pic OxibFWP— NASADecember , Scientists know that Voyager  has left the sun’s influence because of four dferent instruments measuring solar particles and dferent types of rays. They showed a dramatic change on November , indicating the spacecraft was between the stars. One of the instruments measures solar plasma and this is the first time Nasa has seen a drop in that key instrument. The same instrument was not working on Voyager .The twin Voyagers launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in , and zipped by Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The @NASAVoyager  probe no longer feels the solar wind  is flying through the interstellar space between the stars. It carries a working instrument providing st-of-its-kind observations of the nature of this gateway. Heres a look by the numbers: https:t.co DuNBYPaXQj #AGU pic GJGIgDpSHD— NASADecember , Voyager  has already logged more than . billion miles on its interstellar trip going ,mph.“Both spacecrafts are very healthyyou consider them senior citizens,” Voyager project manager Suzanne Dodd said.She said the probes should last at least five, maybe  more years, but the cold — the temperature outside the vehicles is about minus C — and waning power supply will eventually end their usefulness.They will keep travelling and in , years or so they will get close to the next stars, or the stars, which are moving faster, will get close to them, Mr Stone said."},{"url":null,"title":"bin collections confirmed council christmas holiday period","story":"Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor John Boyle, has urged householders to familiarise themselves with Council’s bin collection and Recycling Centre opening arrangements for the Christmas holiday period.There will be some minor changes to bin collections across the city and district and affected householders will be informed of this via special bin stickers which they should look out for in the coming days.All Recycling Centres will be closed on Christmas Day and New Year’s Day and will close at pm on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve with only some centres opening from am to pm on Boxing Day.Mayor Boyle encouraged people to check Council’s website and social media pages to familiarise themselves with the changes to ensure household waste can be efficiently disposed of over the festive season.“The Christmas holiday period necessitates some minor changes to Council’s waste and recycling services but by familiarising yourself with the arrangements now it should allow householders to enjoy a stress free holiday period,” he said.“Many bin collection services will be collected as normal but Council staff will be placing stickers on bins in Derry and Strabane which clearly show the changes to bins that would normally be collected on Christmas Day, New Year’s Day and Boxing Day.“I would encourage householders to inform older neighbours who may not see the stickers or have access to the internet to check the collection times to ensure everyone’s bins are collected during this period.“As we prepare to receive gts and new items into our homes we should also remember that one person’s trash is another person’s treasure, and so we should all make more of an effort to recycle and upcycle goods where possible.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn the Derry area bins normally collected on Christmas Daywill be serviced on Saturday December nd, bins due to be collected on Boxing Daywill be emptied on Saturday December th and bins scheduled for collection on New Year’s Day will be collected on Saturday January th.In Strabane bins normally collected on Christmas Daywill be serviced on Saturday December nd, bins due to be collected on Boxing Daywill be emptied as normal and bins scheduled for collection on New Year’s Day will be collected on Saturday December th.Recycling Centres will all close at pm on Christmas Eve and remain closed on Christmas Day with only Strahan’s Road, Pennyburn and Glendermott opening on Boxing Day from am to pm.All centres will operate normally from Thursday th through to Sunday th December with an early closure of pm on New Year’s Eve and a full closure of all centres on New Year’s Day.The NewYou Centre are setting up a drop off container outside their shop at Pennyburn Recycling Centre where any unwanted furniture or electrical items can be left off during the holiday period.The items will be upcycled and refurbished by unemployed and disabled people training in trade skills and sold at affordable prices in centre in the New Year - helping people re-skill while also helping our environment.Full details of bin collection and recycling centre opening hours are available online at www.derrystrabane recycling."},{"url":null,"title":"budding local photographers asked capture park life moments","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane is calling on all budding photographers to submit their most creative snaps of local park areas in Council’s ‘Park Le’ Photography competition.Two prizes are up for grabs courtesy of local photo printing company PhotoChute, with £ in photography equipment going to the winner of the adult Photographer of the Year category and £ in photography equipment for the junior Photographer of the Year winner.

Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery.

I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event.

He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation.

Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one. If they do not have a decoration, we can make one for them.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9033731.jpg","title":"nuj calls for psni investigation into film makers trevor birney and barry mccaffrey to be dropped","story":"The  documentary by Mr. Birney and Mr. McCaffrey broke new ground by publicly naming those it said were suspects.No one has ever been convicted for the killings.They were applauded by a crowd of around  journalists who gathered to show solidarity as they arrived at the Police Service of Northern IrelandrsquosMusgrave Street station in the city centre.ldquoThis is an extraordinarily important day for press freedom in Northern Ireland, he said.ldquoThis is about press freedom but more importantly itrsquos about the Loughinisland families.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Merkel today after leaving Westminster in turmoil.The Prime Minister’s move to abandon a crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal drew howls of condemnation from the opposition as well as a number of Tories.Theresa May pictured at the House of CommonsMrs May took the decision to pull the vote, scheduled for Tuesday, as the Prime Minister admitted to MPs she faced a “signicant” defeat on her Brexit agenda.The PM will also meet Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte in The Hague on Tuesday in a bid to gain reassurances on the exit deal from European leaders ahead of a crunch EU summit on Thursday.Mrs May, who is facing repeated calls from leading Tory Brexiteers to be replaced as PM, was forced to abandon the Commons vote as the scale of opposition to the Brexit deal, especially regarding proposed backstop arrangements for the Irish border, threatened a crushing rejection of her plans.As anger at Westminster continued to fester over the PM’s move to cancel the Brexit vote, MPs were poised for an emergency debate on the situation on Tuesday.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it would be dficult to get the Brexit deal through Parliament without reassurances the UK would not be “trapped” in backstop measures ensuring noto hard border in Ireland.The backstop would see the UK obey EU customs rules after a transition perioda wider trade deal has not been agreed with the EU by then.Referring to Mrs May’s lobbying mission in Europe, Dr Fox told BBC’s Newsnight: “My colleagues will want to see that their fears of being trapped in a backstop cannot be realised.“Without the ability to genuinely reassure my colleagues that they could not legally be kept in the backstop against their will, it will be dficult to get this through the House of Commons.”He added: “Can we find a way of giving both sides the reassurances they seek “Are there other ways of achieving the actual backstop itself “There is no clear majority in Parliament for anything other than the current deal, with changes to the backstop.Newcastle murder victim would have helped anyone: Pastor Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It seems to me this is the only thing that would be able to get through the House of Commons.“If we can’t get changes to the backstop that may not be possible.“In which case MPs, whether they were Leave or Remain, will have to confront that there is then only one of two options no Brexit, or no deal.”However, European Council president Donald Tusk insisted there was no question of reopening negotiations on the Brexit deal.With Jeremy Corbyn under pressure from a signicant number of MPs and Peers to force a confidence vote on the Government, Labour former Cabinet minister Lord Mandelson said the opposition had not laid a glove on the Government.He told the BBC: “I think the Labour Party, the Labour leadership, is facing a bit of a dilemma.“I mean, they want to straddle, and retain the support of the third of Labour voters who backed Leave in , and the two thirds of Labour voters who backed Remain.“Well, what happens when you, you know, ride two horses like that, you end up doing the splits.”He added: “I think people don’t understand. Why didn’t the Labour Party come out with real bite and lay a glove on what is an absolutely shambolic Government “The only people that the Tory party and the Government don’t fear is the opposition front bench, because they are not laying a glove on them.”Meanwhile, Tory former prime minister David Cameron has said he has no regrets about calling the Brexit referendum - despite previously warning that leaving the European Union would be an “act of economic and political self-harm”.Approached by Sky News while getting into his car, he said: “I don’t regret calling a referendum. I made a promise in the election to call a referendum and I called the referendum.“Obviously I’m very concerned about what’s happening today but I do support the Prime Minister in her efforts to try and have a close partnership with the European Union.“That’s the right thing to do and she has my support.”The usual Tuesday Cabinet meeting will be held later in the week due to Mrs May’s travel plans, Downing Street said.try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealedN.I. boymissing - PSNI concerned for his safety missing - PSNI concerned for his safety\"          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Craigavon Manager Jenner Fearon said: “It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position after our long association with the Citizens Advice brand. From December we will be changing our name to Community Advice Craigavon. For us it is ‘business as usual’.“We have been in talks with Advice NI since the summer and are looking forward to working with our colleagues in the independent advice sector and at Advice NI. We have already moved to a new case management system and we view this as opportunity to improve and develop. We will continue to focus on helping our clients who are experiencing increasing pressures as a result of welfare reform changes and the universal credit roll out. We are grateful for the continued support of the Department for Communities, ABC Council, the Southern Health  Social Care Trust  Macmillan Cancer Support. “We offer help with welfare benefits advice, completion of forms, advice on employment law, consumer rights, housing problems and immigration law. We also have a dedicated debt advice service, guidance on private pensions via the Pensionwise Service  tribunal representation. We have a Macmillan Benefits Service which operates out of Craigavon Hospital for clients with cancer and family members. “We have been able to set up a digital area in our Lurgan office at Mount Zion House.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
