It\u0027s a very popular show and you get to see me in a totally different light.\u0027With a possible new TV show on a horizon, keeping a schedule for Parks is somewhat of a feat in itself. Not only is she a busy mom-of-two, she is a partner in a hectic law firm in Atlanta, a celebrity and contracted model for Wilhelmina Models, and she also runs her own foundation for disadvantaged children and is heavily involved in community activism.But on top of that - and most unusually - Parks is a qualified mortician, embalmer and funeral director as well as a certified cremator, tending to people\u0027s dead relatives.\u0027I\u0027m keeping the dead beautiful and preserved for Jesus,\u0027 she explains.Not only is she a busy mom-of-two, she is a partner in a hectic law firm in Atlanta, a celebrity and contracted model for Wilhelmina Models, and she also runs her own foundation for disadvantaged children and is heavily involved in community activism.          Parks (second from left) hints in part-two of an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, airing on Friday, that she has considered returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta\u0027My life is very busy, I\u0027m fully booked, everybody knows I\u0027m a mortician and summer is the slow season.\u0027I\u0027m partnered with one of the largest funeral homes in Atlanta so I do a lot of bodies there.\u0027I also go to New Orleans and do some bodies there, you know, whoever calls me, I\u0027m a genius at it. I love it. It\u0027s my ministry. And so if you call me, I will come because that\u0027s my specialty.\u0027I love making people look life-like and giving people the proper sendoff.\u0027Parks reveals she was inspired to become a mortician after one of her friends was killed in New Orleans and began volunteering at a funeral home before going to school to get qualified.These days she gets special requests from people who know her from television to care for their loved ones in death and she claims to have buried a number of celebrities herself.She says she wears an elegant black dress, a hat and veil and black lace gloves with the fingers cut out so she can handle the bodies.   "},{"url":null,"title":"James Cracknell pictured stunning new woman side","story":"Share this article A source told MailOnline of the blossoming friendship: \u0027They have become very close and since his marriage break up there are few people who would deny him the support of an attractive young woman.\u0027The end of James\u0027 marriage to Bev has been amicable and friendly but there\u0027s always going to be regret and maybe loneliness when something like that happens so it\u0027s great he\u0027s going his own way.\u0027 Cracknell\u0027s new friend, whose family live in New York, is a member of the \u0027Cambridge Cougars\u0027, a university cheerleading team who support students at sports events. The Olympic gold winning rower - who became the oldest rower to win the boat race for Cambridge earlier this year - announced his split from Beverley in April, as first revealed by Mail Online. Beverley, 45, has remained in the family home in Chiswick, west London with their three children a son aged 15, and two daughters aged 10 and eight.

Mary Creagh hit back that such ‘sexist language’ was ‘used to diminish women’‘After his comments about women driving trains, there appears to be a pattern of behaviour here. He should have been sacked years ago,’ she added.‘Hopefully he will watch from the backbenches as the new Government is stuffed with the sort of powerful woman he takes issue with.’But his spokesman disputed the claims, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘As a former Defence Secretary, the Chancellor has huge respect and admiration for all our Armed Forces — regardless of gender. Having seen first-hand all they do, he is incredibly grateful for their support in helping Ministers travel securely and would never make such comments.’Mr Hammond is widely tipped to be replaced at No. 11. He is understood to have approached pro-Remain Tory donors for funding to pay the salaries of staff members in his beefed-up backbench office, with the aim of launching a ‘guerrilla campaign’ against No Deal.         Tory MP Nadine Dorries said these latest claims ‘do not reflect well on Mr Hammond’On Friday he hinted at his plan to bring the Commons to a standstill if Mr Johnson attempted to force through a No Deal Brexit by suspending Parliament.He said: ‘The idea that elected Members of Parliament will be locked out of their place of work because they might do their job is truly shocking.’And he also backed calls by former Prime Minister and fellow pro-EU voice Sir John Major to sue the Government in the High Court if they attempt to shut down the Commons to trigger a No Deal exit on October 31.Mr Hammond’s mooted operation could be a major obstacle to the new Government, with the Chancellor vowing not to leave Parliament to seek a City job, but instead stay and fight No Deal.A spokesman for Mr Hammond said: ‘Without making assumptions about the next few weeks, many Ministers when leaving Government expand their parliamentary teams to allow them to fulfil their basic duties as MPs.‘They’re no longer able to rely on the support of their department and so require additional resources in their parliamentary teams — and do so in line with Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority rules.’"},{"url":null,"title":"DAVID BLUNKETT predicts autumn General Election change balance power years","story":"Share this article Demoralised Lib Dems and disaffected Greens came over to Labour in unexpected numbers.But the Corbyn faction is wrong. The results of the more recent European elections in May were no fluke. Huge numbers of voters deserted the Labour Party for the Lib Dems and the Greens, and the most recent polling results confirm that the shift is likely to be more permanent than many expected.          Boris Johnson – the most likely winner of the Conservative leadership race – has not ruled out proroguing Parliament, which would mean setting aside the operation of the Commons and bypassing elected MPs in order to drive through a No Deal BrexitA YouGov poll on July 4 showed that together, the Conservatives and the Brexit Party stood at 47 per cent of the vote – as much as the three Left-of-centre parties put together. The same poll saw Labour hit a new low with an unprecedented 18 per cent, which puts them behind the Tories, the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems.True, Labour have done slightly better in the latest ‘poll of polls’ – based on the average of five different pollsters since July 2 – which puts them at 25 per cent. But the Conservative and Brexit parties together still stand at 45 per cent.So, with Mr Corbyn’s ratings at a staggering -55, the worst in living memory for the main Opposition leader, it would take an earthquake to shake a Johnson-Farage pact.The logic is clear – a pact is now the very thing needed from Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens too. The poll of polls shows that together, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens stand at a combined 49 per cent.Throughout my political life, I have been against such political alliances and vehemently opposed coalitions. I have long resisted the idea of pre-election ‘stitch-ups’ because the electorate deserves a choice. But this time, I accept that the only way of providing a real choice is for the three Left-of-centre parties to reach an informal arrangement that avoids what is otherwise inevitable – a spectacular coup for Mr Johnson.Hard as it will be for some to swallow, discussions should be held as to how this can be best achieved. Before anyone brands me ‘traitor’, I am not talking about Labour voters in Labour-held seats being called upon to vote Lib Dem or Green.But we do need a hard-headed and realistic appraisal of where deals can be done and a common platform agreed, based on giving the electorate another chance to consider – having looked into the abyss – whether they really do wish to leave the EU. The logic is the same on both sides of the Brexit ide – the established parties are finding it hard to meet the needs and views of the electorate. Whatever we think of grand coalitions, it seems that, for now at least, their time has come.For the Left-of-centre parties, the alternative is to knowingly walk into a trap that puts hard-line Brexiteers in the driving seat – and, as Mr Johnson has said, into his Cabinet. With them would come a range of economic measures that I believe would reinforce the inequality and antagonism bedevilling our public life. For the Conservatives, too, the logic of an alliance is inescapable.History teaches us that those facing difficult challenges are rarely thanked, but in time, a willingness to act is seen as preferable to sleepwalking into disaster.

She had a considerable reputation as a photographer but, in the years to come, it seems to me, we will cherish her still more warmly and regard her work even more highly. The black-and-white pictures from the 1930s and 40s – kids playing in the streets, old people keeping a watchful eye on the neighbourhood – have a lyrical grace and a rough-and-tumble tenderness. The kids are having a lot of fun – even if that fun involves someone getting hurt – and it’s fun looking at the pictures. They’re easy on the eye in the way that Anna Karenina is easy to read compared with Ulysses. Henri Cartier-Bresson was a decisive influence but Levitt seemed happy to survey the flow of life casually going about its unruly business rather than pouncing on instants of suddenly perfect visual geometry. Her photographic moments, as a result, contain entire childhoods, whole lifetimes of everyday disappointment and routine happiness: the kind of stuff we associate with narrative fiction rather than photographs.In the 1950s she began shooting in colour – not as a formal experiment but as a natural extension of the urge James Agee had observed in the earlier black-and-white work: “to perceive the aesthetic reality within the existing world”. When almost all of this colour work was stolen by a burglar she started afresh in 1971.This picture is part of a retrospective of Levitt’s work now on show at Arles photography festival. I like fondly to think that Levitt had photographed the lady in the marbled blue dress on the left before, Seven Up!-style, caught in a similar gesture of playful triumph – now that she’s old it might just be backache – when they were both young, in the 1930s. But the other woman, on the right, haven’t I seen her before too, at exactly the age she is now, looking on with that same attitude of rough-hewn, nosy resignation, in black-and-white pictures from before the war? There is, in other words, something timely and eternal about Levitt. So while her city has changed, has become, in many ways, a playground for the young and affluent, this picture also depicts a distinctively 21st-century scenario: Airbnb guests, with all their luggage, wondering when their host is going to show up. Help is, as they say, at hand it’s just that no one knows what form it might take.• Helen Levitt: Observing New York’s Streets is at Espace Van Gogh, Arles photography festival, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9800ab547d361fa5569de0fcc5b34425731073f2/0_1003_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e4ec8a9b4ea1830bb3b57d867404c4","title":"celebrating rave culture in pictures","story":"From warehouse parties to the acid house explosion, new exhibition Sweet Harmony: Rave Today captures a dancefloor revolution.

It states that both uncertainty around Brexit and the global economic slowdown have led to the highest recession risk since 2007.It raises the alarm over the potential impact on living standards, warning that the five previous recessions have produced an economic shock equating to a £2,500 loss for each household in the UK. They have also increased unemployment by one million.It comes after a series of warnings over the health of the economy amid continuing uncertainty around Britain’s EU membership. Earlier this month the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned that there had been a “sea change” in the world’s financial markets, driven by pessimism about the economic outlook.Meanwhile there have been warning signs in the construction industry. The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply has warned the political paralysis gripping Westminster has left the industry trapped in “quicksand”, with house buying and new orders dropping “like a stone”.There are also concerns that the government and Bank of England have already used many of the tools in their armoury that could curb a future recession. Cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy is hard, as they are already at historically low levels, while quantitative easing (QE), in which more money is pumped into the economy, is likely to have less effect than in the past.The Resolution Foundation also warns that it would be dangerous to assume that the next recession will be the same as the last, when major job losses were avoided. It states that it may not be the case that the big unemployment increases that characterised the 1980s and early 1990s recessions have been consigned to history. “This all means the UK needs a new plan to respond to the next recession and, whether or not a downturn starts in the near future, planning for it certainly should,” it concludes.The recession warning comes in the Resolution Foundation report Failing to Plan  Planning to Fail, the first of a series looking at the impact of recessions on low-and-middle income households. The foundation’s “recession risk” indicator, which uses yields on government bonds to assess the threat from a recession, suggests that Britain’s recession risk has risen to its highest level since 2007.James Smith, its research director, warned against complacency. “Ten years on from the end of the last downturn, the UK’s recession risk is at its highest level since 2007, with growth slowing at home and abroad, and widespread uncertainty around Brexit,” he said. “While recessions differ in terms of the cause and effect, they are all uniformly bad for living standards. The average economic hit from the last five downturns has been equivalent to £2,500 for every household in Britain, and a million people losing their jobs.“Policy-makers can’t prevent recessions from happening, but they can limit their damage with the right policy response. The problem for the incoming government and the Bank of England however is that many of the tools used to fight the last downturn – from big interest rate cuts to £375bn of QE – are either spent or severely blunted. So whether or not a downturn starts in the near future, planning for it certainly should.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eb5e5e7b8f8d5ba87b88feaa5b6fbfc1f0e8fc3/0_130_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4de92de1a4707e94a04e7a97980db52","title":"unite to investigate claims of collusion with construction blacklist","story":"Allegations focus on union officials passing information to bosses about potential ‘troublemakers’Britain’s biggest trade union has launched an inquiry into longstanding allegations that union officials colluded with a clandestine blacklist which was run and funded by large construction firms to prevent specific workers from getting jobs.The inquiry set up by Unite will examine claims that union officials privately passed information to construction industry managers who compiled secret files on thousands of workers.Previously confidential documents have suggested that union officials warned company managers not to employ some of their own members because they were considered troublemakers. Managers involved in the blacklist have claimed that union officials gave them information as they wanted to prevent disruption on construction sites.The inquiry has been commissioned by Unite’s leader, Len McCluskey, following pressure from blacklisted workers who said the allegations were a “running sore” for the trade union movement.Details of the inquiry were circulated in an internal letter by Andrew Murray, Unite’s chief of staff, who is also an adviser to the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn.Murray warned that the position was “quite clear”, that any official found to have colluded with blacklisters would be subjected to the union’s disciplinary rules.A team of lawyers will examine claims that the alleged collusion involved officials still working for Unite as well as those who worked for unions that merged with Unite. The complicity is alleged to have ned at least three decades to 2009.In a statement, Unite said it was always committed to transparency about this issue, adding: “This ongoing commitment will see us review all documents that are in the public domain, listen to the accounts of iniduals and ask people to come forward with any evidence they want considered.”Evidence of the alleged collusion emerged from documents drawn up for a high court lawsuit which led to more than 1,100 blacklisted workers winning payouts totalling £55m from the construction firms.As part of an out-of-court settlement, eight construction firms, including Sir Robert McAlpine and Balfour Beatty, were compelled to apologise unreservedly to the blacklisted workers.In 2009, an official watchdog had closed down the blacklist after concluding that more than 40 construction firms had unlawfully stored secret files on more than 3,200 trade unionists.Construction industry managers pooled information about the workers’ employment records, political views, health and personal relationships in the files.When workers applied for jobs, the managers ran their names through the files to vet them. Those considered by managers as politically awkward were rejected, and not told why. Some of the workers were denied work for long periods. Some files recorded how the workers had raised simple health and safety concerns on construction sites.The files suggested trade union officials had described inidual workers as “militant”, a troublemaker or with a warning to be “careful”.For 30 years, Daniel O’Sullivan was a construction industry manager who was once chairman of the Consulting Association, the bland name given to the secret agency that managed the blacklist.According to the legal documents, O’Sullivan said he often met trade union officials as part of his job. He said the officials gave him information about particular iniduals as they were “concerned to prevent unnecessary disruption on site”. He cited as an example a worker who was described in his file as a “troublemaker” by a union official in 2005.Another former construction industry manager, Dudley Barratt, has said union officials gave him names of iniduals they thought should not be employed as there was a “quiet acceptance” by some unions of the blacklist and the “benefits” of vetting workers who could be disruptive.Alan Wainwright, a former manager who blew the whistle on the blacklist, has said he told officials at the Amicus trade union, which later merged with Unite, about the blacklist as early as 2005 but his evidence was ignored.Unite’s lawyers have helped a large number of blacklisted workers to secure compensation in legal actions which concluded in May. McCluskey promised to launch the inquiry after the legal action had ended.Dave Smith, secretary of the Blacklist Support Group which represents blacklisted workers, said his group had received “assurances from Unite that the entire process will be carried out by senior counsel and solicitors independently from the union. This is essential and we applaud the union for committing to such a transparent investigation – we intend to hold the union to that promise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51e70f218a7252c2b0f0645992fac78e56df2f74/0_251_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63510c31e728a824c77031a4656a9643","title":"brexiters blind optimism pitiful dose of pessimism realistic","story":"When historians write the last pages of their books, and the producers of history documentaries sit down to edit the final minutes of their programmes, there is often a strong urge to look to the future and emphasise the positive. That impulse is at its most acute when the subject of the book or documentary in question is British history.The classic formulation is something along the lines of: Britain and her institutions are remarkably adaptable, the nation has survived two world wars and endured the loss of empire, we will surely cope with whatever the future has in store… roll credits, press send, everyone down the pub.The past three years have left many of those final chapters and closing scenes in need of urgent rewrites. Brexit, the rise of populism and the constitutional crisis in which we are still utterly ensnared – despite the passing distraction of the Tory leadership circus – undermines that sort of blithe optimism.Now is not the time for upbeat endings. It is a moment to make the case for an ever unpopular and always controversial sentiment – pessimism.But pessimism has an image problem. To describe someone as a pessimist is to issue an insult, whereas to be labelled an optimist is to get a pat on the back. To dismiss someone’s argument as pessimistic is to suggest it is the product of a personality disorder, rather than careful analysis.This lazy stance is easy to adopt and often highly effective in debate. It is what Boris Johnson clumsily and desperately attempted last week, while floundering against Andrew Neil: “Why this defeatism? Why this negativity?” he blustered, in a pitiful effort to draw attention away from his demonstrable ignorance of his own Brexit “plan”. Don’t analyse, stop identifying flaws and inconsistencies, just be optimistic. Rejoice. Rejoice.The prevailing cult of optimism reinforces the belief that Britain’s institutions – parliament, the civil service and that jumble of conventions and archaic procedures that are what passes for a constitution – will inevitably weather any future storm.Well, it’s not been a great week for the civil service a police investigation has been launched into a leak apparently designed to bring down our ambassador to the most powerful nation on earth, followed by his public defenestration by the PM-in-waiting. Month by month our constitution has been proved unfit for purpose and parliament’s physical decay is increasingly turning it into a vast, scaffold-covered metaphor.A musty, chintzy kitschness lingers about the Palace of Westminster. A cabbagey, care-home smell wafts along its neo-gothic corridors. With Johnson refusing to rule out bypassing parliament (with his threatened prorogation and his opponents discussing setting up a rival assembly across the road, you have to really want to see the “mother of parliaments” cup as half full.The unlikely patron saint of this form of optimistic, national exceptionalism is Winston Churchill, a man who suffered bouts of depression and spent a decade in the political wilderness for pessimistically predicting a global catastrophe. Hardly the ideal poster boy for the breezy optimism of Johnson and his cabal. And to go by run of form, optimism is on a losing streak. Optimists confidently predicted Trump would mature in office and they have repeatedly administered the last rites to Nigel Farage’s political career and failed utterly to identity the risks that led us into our current age of anger and chaos.Whether we like it or not, there are moments in history when pessimism is the appropriate response. Times when, as the German philosopher Oswald Spengler said, “optimism is cowardice”. What is needed now is not a “nameless, unreasoning, unjustified” form of pessimism that “paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance”, to quote Franklin D Roosevelt, but a sobering and energising pessimism. It is necessary because the cult of optimism, the original source of our national complacency, is in itself a clear and present danger.The Brexit project exploited our cultural predilection for optimism. Leave was painted as the optimistic choice. Now, when the Brexiteers are not promising us “adequate food”, they are peddling another brand of optimism. No matter what happens at the end of October, they tell us, we’ll be all right. After all, if we can make it through the Second World War we can survive Brexit. One of the many holes in this “there’ll always be an England” line of argument is, of course, that half a million British people didn’t make it through the Second World War.That reality is perhaps why the support for Remain was high among a demographic that is rarely mentioned. The simplistic belief that the old voted Leave and the young voted Remain ignores the fact that the most elderly, the people who actually remember the Second World War, who fought and suffered in it, were “far more likely to oppose Brexit”, according to some research, than the baby boomers – a generation brought up watching war films rather than cowering in Anderson shelters.And is it that surprising that the most privileged generation to have ever lived harbour less pessimism than their parents or their children and grandchildren?It is true that Britain and its institutions have survived past crises, but often this was because those in charge, at a certain point, snapped out of the stupor of latent optimism, recognised the dangers circling the nation and acted. Call it pessimism, realism or pragmatism: we urgently need exactly that sort of awakening now.• David Olusoga is a historian and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc6c8a745fc86765931aa808bb07ed9dffdc0e7/10_317_4276_2565/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2a73bce1485175138d9f514cfb2ccf9","title":"where are the uk politicians with principles they would stand down for","story":"In her swansong appearances at the dispatch box, Theresa May is endeavouring to get in touch with her funny side. She recently tried mocking Jeremy Corbyn by quoting Groucho Marx. “Those are my principles, and if you don’t like them... well, I have others.”I expect most of the public take the Groucho view of politicians. In my experience, though, it is not true to say that their principles are endlessly mutable. Rather, what most politicians have is a hierarchy of convictions of varying degrees of flexibility.At the bottom of this hierarchy are the disposable convictions, things that politicians hold true only until they become inconvenient. Then they will be discarded in the pursuit of electoral gain, suppressed in service of party unity or subjugated to career ambition. Boris Johnson is the quintessential contemporary example of a man with many strong convictions, all weakly held.Then there are the higher principles. The things that a politician really does hold dear and will be prepared to self-sacrifice for. In defence of these convictions, they may rebel against the party whip, quit a frontbench job and jeopardise their prospects by infuriating the leader. One dramatic example of that was Robin Cook quitting Tony Blair’s cabinet over the Iraq war. Another was Michael Heseltine resigning from Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet over the Westland affair. They left government on a point of principle, but they remained within their respective parties.At the apex of the hierarchy is the first-order principle, a belief so important to a politician that he or she will even quit their party to uphold their convictions. Opposing racism is – or certainly ought to be – a first-order principle for any member of the Labour party. If the Labour party is about anything, it surely has to be about opposing racism in all its manifestations. And if it can’t be relied on to do that, then it is no longer the Labour party. Three longstanding Labour peers have just quit because they do not believe that Labour can be counted any more as a non-racist party. Lords Darzi, Triesman and Turnberg had thought that it was worth staying within the party to fight antisemitism, but all have now been compelled to the conclusion that the struggle is so hopeless that it is morally indefensible to remain as members. David Triesman, a former party general secretary, says that Labour has become “very plainly institutionally antisemitic” and cannot be cleansed of this poison for so long as Jeremy Corbyn remains leader.Lord Triesman is not alone in that view, further evidence for which was furnished by the Panorama investigation featuring eight whistleblowers, so distressed by what they had seen that some were driven into depression and one into contemplation of suicide. Their testimony was that they were fatally undermined in their attempts to tackle antisemitism by members of the leader’s entourage, who sought to downplay cases of anti-Jewish racism and dilute sanctions against it. To my mind, the aggressively denialist response to Panorama by the leadership was as revealing as the programme itself. Rather than regret what had come to light, apologise deeply and pledge urgent remedial action, Mr Corbyn’s spinners, spokespeople and sock puppets denounced the BBC while trying to trash the former Labour staffers who were the programme’s principal witnesses. As for the shadow cabinet, the kindest description of most of them is cowardly. The bulk of Labour’s senior team has reacted to the antisemitism scandal with dumb silence, as if gagged with non-disclosure agreements. They have not been available to defend the leader and his inner circle nor have they raised their voices to demand action before Labour’s reputation, and by association their own, is irredeemably stained.An exception has been Tom Watson, the deputy leader, who has said that the “harrowing testimony” in the programme is further evidence that “there is a sickness in our party”. He is making a particular issue of the secretive manner in which Mr Corbyn’s team are handling the investigation into anti-Jewish racism within Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Mr Watson rightly says that it is outrageous that the national executive committee, the party’s governing body, is not being given sight of Labour’s submission to the EHRC. We can grasp why Mr Corbyn and his inner circle are being furtive about its contents. If it contains admissions that the party has developed a grave problem with antisemitism on his watch, that will be damaging. If the submission is an evasive and obfuscatory piece of work, maintaining that there is really nothing much to be troubled about, that will be even more damaging.The vast majority of Labour MPs are disgusted that their party has become a home for antisemites, appalled by the leadership’s failure to deal with it properly, and frightened to say anything. This latest episode highlights the moral dilemma that is going to face them at the next general election, an event that could be upon them as early as this autumn. If they present themselves as Labour candidates at that election, they will have to go on doorsteps and before television cameras to recommend the installation of Mr Corbyn as prime minister and the promotion of his senior aides to some of the most powerful positions in the land. This will not be a bother for the minority of Labour MPs who think he will make an excellent prime minister, and who also maintain that the country will be safe, prosperous and tolerant in the hands of the Labour leader and his entourage. The moral dilemma is for the many more Labour MPs who believe he is absolutely unfit to be prime minister, for an array of reasons, and who further think that his inner cadre should not be allowed anywhere near the levers of power in Number 10.A mirroring moral dilemma will face Tory MPs in the highly likely event of a Boris Johnson premiership. He has said he is prepared to crash Britain out of the EU on Halloween without a deal, a prospect that a significant cohort of Conservative MPs regard as grotesquely irresponsible. This autumn, these Tory MPs may have to choose between permitting a calamity Brexit or voting with the opposition to stop it, even if that means collapsing their own government. How far can their principles be stretched? In some cases, Tory consciences have a lot of elastic in their knickers. Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, who have previously been eloquently vocal about what a catastrophe a no-deal Brexit would be, are now sounding like people reconciled to the idea, a conversion that may not be entirely unconnected to the expectation that Mr Johnson will be picking the next cabinet. Others have been more consistent. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, told the Observer recently that he would rather vote on a confidence motion to terminate his own government than allow a crash-out Brexit. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, says the same. If it comes to the crunch, they will put conscience and country first. Other Tories have yet to finish wrestling with their principles. Like their Labour counterparts, they are hoping that they will somehow be spared from having to make a choice, that they will not face a moment of truth in the moral crucible. But that test may well come, and very soon.Both Labour and Conservative MPs are confronted with a career- and character-defining question, and it grows sharper by the week. When do they say to themselves that enough is enough? Where is the point when it becomes indefensible to stay within parties that are so abhorrent to their first-order principles? They will have to talk to their consciences, assuming that they can remember where they left them.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2093a8d1ea9a4d1d76a85d136eb3d1c698fd0886/0_350_7740_4644/master/7740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f455145e495adfec172445b2da1afb84","title":"up on the roof pushing cricket to new heights","story":"A lack of space at one east London school didn’t prevent it from putting cricket at the heart of breaktime and giving children the chance to shineCricket matches have been played in some unorthodox locations: 5,730 metres up Kilimanjaro, underwater in Derbyshire’s River Derwent, and among the penguins of Antarctica.So perhaps pitching up on a school roof doesn’t seem so strange after all. When pupils at Hague primary school in Bethnal Green, east London, said they wanted to play cricket, there was a problem – the playground had very little space and no grass at all.“It was like a Victorian yard,” recalls headteacher, Judy Coles. So the school built a rooftop playground, complete with concertinaing cricket nets.Coach Soyfur Rahman was 11 when he arrived in England from Bangladesh 15 years ago. He spoke hardly any English and found the transition a “great shock” at first. He remembers with a smile the joy of playing on the roof. “I loved it,” he says. “I was always trying to hit the ball past the nets and off the roof.”He wasn’t the only one – he remembers that when England cricketers Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook visited the school they also tried to hit the ball for six. No wonder the school insisted that a soft ball was used!Cricket helped the 11-year-old to integrate. He had played street cricket in Bangladesh and when he started playing the game at his new school he quickly began to learn English. “I was the only Bengali speaker in the team, so that made me learn English quicker,” says Rahman, who is now 26.“Listening to my teammates I started to pick up words. Thanks to cricket, I learned English quicker than other kids from Bangladesh. It also gave me a lot of confidence.”When the staff noticed that Rahman had a special talent, Coles helped him to get involved with local cricket clubs. He also received coaching from Chance to Shine, the charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through cricket.Rahman credits his success to the coaching courses run by the charity. “They really help coaches to get better and show us how to get the best out of the kids,” he says. “Whatever support I needed, Chance to Shine provided. Then Middlesex hired me to deliver what I’d learned.”He says the charity’s support of young people is transformative, and helps to put them on the right path. “Rather than hanging round on the street, they can play cricket and take a different direction in their lives,” he says.NatWest has been supporting cricket for almost 40 years. It works with Chance to Shine to help create opportunities such as Rahman’s, and keep programmes like this free of charge – something Rahman says is vital.“Among the south-Asian community here, money is a problem. And if you play club cricket the usual way you have to pay for membership, bats, pads, helmet, gloves, bags and shoes. That’s a lot of money, and would be a barrier for many people. But with Chance to Shine projects you don’t need to spend anything. It’s free. You can just turn up, have a game and go home.”For Coles, unearthing and supporting a talent like Rahman’s is life-affirming. Cricket has been her passion since childhood, when she sat at the boundary and proudly watched her grandfather play.She describes it as “an absolute pleasure” to watch children playing team games and developing their skills. “You get children who start not knowing one end of the bat from another and then become good players,” she says. “They develop such confidence.”She also gets parents involved, to make it a family affair. “None of us have great talent, but we have enthusiasm – and we want children to have fun,” she says.Coles says Chance to Shine is “really good at getting cricket into schools, particularly in the inner cities” and believes the charity’s team are “fantastic ambassadors for the game”.With the charity’s support, some of her pupils were invited to open up the London Stock Exchange with cricket legend Devon Malcolm. They have also been taken to see Test matches at Lord’s and the Oval.The school has built a strong cricket culture and the pupils are enthused by the sport – the girls are particularly passionate about the game. “You see them getting involved at lunchtime,” says Coles. “I’m really proud of that.”Rahman thinks that this summer will be the one where cricket really captures the mood of the nation. “With the work Chance to Shine is doing, and the World Cup and Ashes taking place, I think there will be more interest in cricket than ever before,” he says. “That is really positive.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

When tens of thousands of visitors pour into the Scottish capital in August, more than doubling its population, it will appear to be booming.And to the television producers who arrive on the lookout for fresh talent, it will seem in rude health. After all, top names in entertainment, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Tim Minchin, Sara Pascoe, Romesh Ranganathan and Sarah Millican, all earned their chance to reach a mass audience following hit shows on the fringe. Yet fears are building about the festival’s future as a test-bed and showcase for creative talent. “We’re in dire straits now,” said veteran comedy promoter Mel Brown.Her worry? The recent decision of leading Scottish newspapers and magazines to slash their coverage of the festival in half. Coupled with the dwindling size of the annual contingent of London critics, the threat to the ecology of the festival is real.“The falling away of the number of critics who can afford to come up to the festival has a cumulative effect,” Brown added. “It is hard for us to get the word out about shows during the festival without the help of the star ratings given out. These sell the shows to the crowds when there are so many to choose from when we put them on the posters and leaflets. The word of proper, quality reviewers really matters.”Every year the festival (which is really two festivals, an official, international arts one and a vast fringe of amateur and professional shows) gets bigger. This time there will be around 59,000 performances in its 330 or so fringe venues, making it, taken together, the third biggest ticketed gathering in the world, after the World Cup and the Olympics.For some time the fringe festival has been dominated by cabaret and comedy. It provides a conveyor belt of virtuoso creativity, including daring, genre-busting productions like Jerry Springer: The Opera, to be revived in Manchester in August, and dating back beyond the early appearance of Stephen Fry, who shared the first-ever comedy award in 1981 with Emma Thompson and Hugh Laurie. Fry is back this year in the official festival with his show about Greek gods.“The festival is the place where extraordinary talent is found, year after year,” said theatrical impresario Nica Burns, the director of the festival’s prestigious comedy awards, renamed the Daves last week as a new sponsorship deal with the comedy channel was signed. “So it is absolutely vital these shows get the attention they deserve. One of the main reasons we have run the awards for almost 40 year now is to make sure that we have a network of experts seeing the shows and finding the good stuff.”According to one journalist on the Scotsman, the halving of professional critics and reviewers is simply the result of editorial budget cuts. But the economic basis of the festival is also now endangered by the high cost of accommodation in the city and by a political push to regulate the low pay and exploitative practices widespread among fringe venues.One performer who understands the high stakes at Edinburgh better than most is Timandra Harkness, the writer and radio presenter who is returning to live comedy this summer with a show all about risk. Her show, Take A Risk, playfully highlights five categories of human risk – social, financial, physical, emotional and to future health – and she candidly admits that taking her show to the fringe exposes her to all five.“We are all different, but I am most averse to financial risk, so it is strange I am doing this to myself,” Harkness said, adding that her ultimate reward would be having her show picked out for praise by both the critics and the crowds: “I felt my life was getting too safe really, so I wanted to go back to comedy.”Another performer preparing to step out on an empty stage this year is Izzy Mant, an experienced television comedy producer who already knows the value of critical success in Edinburgh. “The fringe has been a fixture on my calendar for decades because it is the best way to take the temperature of the work people are making: it gives you a panoramic view that helps you judge the work. As a producer, I know if someone can still make you laugh when you have a hangover and it is the sixth show of the day, then they must be good.”Mant said there is now greater coverage of music festivals than of arts festivals, so less work for specialist arts critics. “I don’t understand it,” she said. “Especially as comedy is so popular and Edinburgh is now largely associated with comedy, though there is still brilliant theatre as well.” Mant, whose show is called Polite Club, points out that many of the stars she has worked with in television got their start in Edinburgh. “It is Edinburgh that often does it for them, even if they have been working hard on the circuit,” Mant said. “Someone like Roisin Conaty, who I worked with on Channel 4’s GameFace, made a huge splash there first. And it is my experience of the importance of the festival that has made me choose it as the best place to start my move into writing and performing.”Several national newspapers have shed staff critics in the last few years. Comedy and theatre critic Veronica Lee has watched the shrinking band of professional critics who can afford to attend Edinburgh with regret.“Any cutback on covering the best arts festival in the world is a real shame,” Lee said. “There is no shortage of opinion out there, of course. Lots of people post online or review for free, but for two decades now the number of top-level critics has been falling. It seems people are forgetting how important this festival is: it makes around £90m for the city and feeds the beast of television.“Where would comedy shows be without Edinburgh to develop their new talents each year?”The newcomers critics found on the fringe:Aisling Bea (2012)Winner of the So You Think You’re Funny award, she was nominated the following year as best newcomer. “You won’t see many more assured newcomer sets than this,” the  said.Reginald D Hunter (2002)The festival favourite was spotted for the laid-back storytelling that later took him on to Never Mind The Buzzcocks, QI and Have I Got News For You.The Mighty Boosh (1998) Surreal sketch humour from Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding, with Rich Fulcher, saw them soon established as a comedy brand still fondly remembered by fans around the world. Barratt now acts and Fielding is one of the hosts of The Great British Bake Off on Channel 4.Harry Hill (1992)Winner of the first newcomer award, Hill was soon given his own show on Channel 4. He later hit the mainstream with Harry Hill’s TV Burp on ITV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54b978746540ec7d142ba6ab8dd285bb5436418/0_75_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ee893abb1057af315eb32d181ef61c","title":"ottawa the ultimate seven day itinerary","story":"Where else can you cycle river paths, shop farmers’ markets, and watch city lights from a hot tub?

Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey.

Funding disparities between different state schools are being exacerbated, putting some children at an even greater disadvantage.”The 30 highest-earning PTAs identified by the Observer are overwhelmingly in the south-east of England. None were in the north, half were in London, with a further nine elsewhere in the south-east. The majority of the schools they support were rated “outstanding” by Ofsted, with the rest rated “good”. Six raised more than £100,000 a year for their schools.An analysis of academy accounts found even more extreme examples of private donations made directly to schools (rather than via PTAs). Some academies received more than £1m in direct donations from philanthropists, parents and corporate donors.Cardinal Vaughan Memorial school, a Catholic boys’ comprehensive in Holland Park, west London, raised £631,770 in unrestricted donations from parents, alumni and other benefactors. The headteacher, Paul Stubbings, said: “Like all state schools at the moment, we have been placed in an impossible position by government funding: we need to contend not only with cuts, but also rising staff costs, including unfunded pay awards, rising national insurance and pension contributions and, of course, inflation. The choice is stark: we have to cut provision or raise funds. At the Vaughan, we have done the latter to ease the former.”The Observer also looked at the 30 mainstream state schools with the highest proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in England, where two out of three children are from disadvantaged backgrounds. Most were in the north, while just three were in London. Several were rated “inadequate” or “requires improvement”. Just nine said they had an active PTA – more than two-thirds do not even attempt to raise any funds from local families. Of those with PTAs that responded to requests for information, the average annual amount raised was £1,700.A Department for Education spokesman said: “There is more money going into schools than ever before. We know schools face budgeting challenges, which is why we have introduced a wide range of support to help schools reduce costs.“The secretary of state has made clear that as we approach the next spending review, he will back headteachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world-class education in the years ahead.”• To find the highest-earning PTAs, the Observer performed a number of keyword searches on the Charity Commission website to build a database. Special schools and independent schools were excluded. Free school meals and Ofsted data were added for schools supported by PTAs. The Observer also surveyed 30 mainstream schools with the highest proportion of children on free school meals about any PTA income. PTAs, which are unincorporated charities, are not required to register with the Charity Commission unless they earn over £5,000, and the searches will not capture PTAs with non-standard names.Additional reporting by Oleksandr Shevchenko"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4fc6ef864e59358e7078107d3b00d868719474/0_370_5737_3442/master/5737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb1dcbe15bfb874c7b6298df0003c47","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"This week: Hungary’s insect of 2019, and bluehead wrasse courtship and sex change"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93bda4381520f74ed4481812c1885fb5a9adee4d/0_251_4369_2622/master/4369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842db9e5bc2196da6e993a0a72a51691","title":"recipe that reminds me of home souvlaki somali bean stew","story":"Greek souvlaki, Somali bean stew, Indonesian omelette – dishes that take our cooks back to their rootsThe key to Somali cooking is xawaash spice mix – translated it means “the essentials”. It’s often described as in between ras el hanout and garam masala, which is how I think of Somali food: in between Arabic and Indian, with African thrown in. When you make it, it will come as no surprise to know Somalia was called “Regio Aromatica”, or the aromatic isles, by the ancient Romans.Xawaash is made family to family, so my mum’s is the one I make, although she sometimes adds turmeric to hers. You adapt it depending on what you have, but I’ve got a consistent recipe that reminds me of her cooking.My idea of home is tied in with my mum’s cooking. I was born in Kuwait. My mum was probably born in Ethiopia she was a nomadic herder. My dad is from the city, from Hargeisa in Somaliland. They moved to Kuwait, had children and then they separated and we came to London in 1985. Civil unrest had been rumbling in Somaliland, so we didn’t go back. Mum wanted her daughters to be educated, and Somali culture can be sexist, although it also celebrates strong women. I named my supper club after Arawelo, a fearsome Somali queen who led a women’s army. We lived in Harlesden, in north-west London, which had Caribbean and African shops. But Mum would also take two buses to get spices and things like fresh tamarind from the Indian shops on Ealing Road. I used to help her out in the kitchen when I was young but was rubbish at it. I felt that girls were expected to help with cooking but boys weren’t, so that pissed me off. When I left London I missed her food, so had to learn it for myself. Ful – we call it maraq digir – is a great way to feed a big family. Beans are cheap, and the xawaash is a good way of adding lots of flavour. People know about ful medames from Egypt, but the dish goes all the way down east Africa to Sudan. We would have that for brunch on Saturday, made with tinned adzuki beans, fried onions and lots of green chillies, fresh coriander, fresh tomatoes – and the xaawash spice mix. When my mum had less money she would get bones with tiny bits of meat left on. She was feeding so many – she’d make enough for 20 people a day. Us and our friends who’d be round, or people from the Somali community. We didn’t eat much English food, and of course I wanted fish and chips and pizza. Now I appreciate it all. My mum taught us to have a palate. If I go into a fancy restaurant, I don’t have to like it. Not because I grew up poor, Somali or as a refugee, or because I don’t understand western flavours. I just might not like it. But if you’re outside that world you can feel uncomfortable trusting your own judgment. It sometimes feels like the food world is for a particular class, a particular place, a particular kind of person who is a “foodie”. Everyone eats food, so I don’t know what defines a foodie. My mum is an amazing chef. She’s illiterate, she grew up as a nomadic herder, but has an instinctive way of making food that is good and tasty.

Sometimes I add fresh ginger to give it an extra boost. Put the mixture to one side.In a saucepan, boil the adzuki beans for about 20 minutes. (You can also use tinned fava beans.) Fry the sliced onion slowly in the olive oil until slightly caramelised. Stir in the xawaash spice blend. Fry a little longer, then add the coriander and tomato mixture, with some tomato paste. Add salt to taste.Leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, adding a little water if needed. Add the beans and cook for another 15-20 minutes, then mash some of the beans.I like it with feta and black olives and lots of olive oil on top. Serve with pita or naan bread, za’atar and olive oil.Arawelo Eats supper club in aid of the Leading Lights youth charity is on 27 July araweloeatsEver since I was little, I’ve craved new flavours. I always loved seafood, and this dish was my favourite. My mum or grandma prepared it on special occasions and it represents flavours from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.When I was growing up in Mexico City, living by the coast was the dream. In the late 1990s, places opened in Mexico City that evoked the marisquerías, the seafood restaurants of Veracruz, which is the state where arroz a la tumbada comes from. They weren’t glamorous but 20 years ago they were cool. They were neighbourhood places where the seafood was amazing and brought in from the coast. There is one called Contramar that’s still going, and is one of my favourite places. We’d go a lot, for the food, and the son jarocho, the music of Veracruz. Without travelling, I could be taken to the coast. It doesn’t matter where I am, arroz a la tumbada will send me to Mexico and give me that feeling of being happy.There’s a lot of Spanish influences in our cuisine, so this is a paella adapted to Mexico. There are no rules for the seafood you use, as long as there’s a combination. Like lots of Mexican dishes, it’s created so people can adapt to what’s around. White fish, clams, crab, prawns – whatever you have is what’s perfect. Now that I live in London, I add fennel and dill. In Mexico we use parsley, coriander, Mexican oregano and epazote, a very aromatic herb that’s difficult to find here. Instead of long-grain rice I use arborio, which I think makes more sense, being closer to the Mediterranean. I feel very grateful that I’ve had many homes. My wife Natalie is half-Mexican and half-English, she was born and raised and studied in the UK. When I go away, I miss London. But I still sometimes miss Mexico, and it’s mainly because of the food. Tacos and tequila are easy to get now, but the flavour that always lifts me out of homesickness is smoky chillies. If I feel homesick I can now get or make the food I want. At the beginning when I moved here I couldn’t say this, but London is home.

Recaudo in Mexico is a special blend of spices, herbs and chillies, and like many dishes in Mexican cuisine, it is the secret of our abuelitas, our grandmothers.Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic on an oven tray, drizzle with rapeseed oil and bake in the oven for about 25 minutes.I recommend using a variety of good quality tomatoes seasonal local tomatoes during the summer in the UK are amazing, such as those from the Isle of Wight.While the tomatoes are in the oven, place the dried chipotle chillies in a small bowl, cover with boiling water and rest until they become soft. Once softened, remove the seeds. Reserve the soaking water.Take the tomatoes out of the oven and pour them with the juices into a blender, add the soft chipotle chillies, the salt and a little of the soaking water, if necessary, and blend to a very smooth paste. Set aside.For the rice, in a paella-like pan heat a tablespoon of the rapeseed oil and 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the fish and prawns, season with a bit of salt and sear them until they get some colour on each side. It’s important to use a really hot pan and not to overcook them. Remove them from the pan and set aside.In the same pan add the remaining oil and butter and the sliced fennel, and fry slowly until it softens and caramelises.Add the rice and keep stirring. Once it is lightly fried, pour in the tomato-chipotle recaudo, add the stock a little at a time and stir frequently until the rice is fully cooked.Three-quarters of the way through adding the liquid, and just before the rice absorbs all of it, add the seared prawns and fish and let them cook through. The rice should be al dente. Season with salt and coarse black pepper to taste.Finish by generously squeezing the lemon juice over and add fresh dill leaves, a few sprigs of mint and parsley, and the tomatoes. Serve warm, making sure everybody gets some of the fish and prawns, as well as the fresh herbs and tomatoes. Enjoy with your family and pair it with a crisp, fresh lager or glass of wine. santoremedioThe recipe for my grandmother’s omelette reminds me of West Sumatra, where I was born, and my first seven years living there with her. She did all of the cooking. My parents were teachers and they worked every day, so my grandmother gave us all breakfast. Sometimes she would make this omelette. We were an extended, multi-generational family living in one house, so there might have been my young uncle or cousin having breakfast with us. It is quite a filling omelette, so we could choose to have rice porridge or this, but some of my boy cousins might have both! Or, we might take it for lunch with rice.Omelettes are quite universal. I debated when I wrote this recipe whether its origin is Chinese or Dutch. Probably in my household it would be the influence of the Dutch. Both my parents were educated in Dutch schools. My grandmother never went to school – she was rich enough to have teachers at home – but I am not sure where she learned to make this omelette. You never know with Indonesia. When I started to write my cookbook I didn’t know the origin of quite a lot of Indonesian food. Some seems to have come from the Arab countries, through India. A lot of our curries are Indian, and our snacks are very similar to Middle Eastern snacks like borek and falafel. With the Dutch we started making cake, and before the Dutch arrived we had influence from the Chinese. Fried rice was originally Chinese but now it’s famous as Indonesian nasi goreng.After my husband Roger and I got married in Indonesia we came to live in the UK. My children were born here, and this is very much my home. When I moved to the UK, I had to make adjustments to my cooking. I first came here in 1964, and from then until 1969 we did our shopping in Holland. Indonesian food was already being imported there but not to the UK. So I travelled a lot to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or the Hague. We’d go with empty cars and come back with the boots full. And there were quite a lot of Indonesian restaurants to visit there were only two in London.I never really got homesick for Indonesian food, because I’d cook it myself. I could never recommend Indonesian restaurants in London, so whenever friends asked, “Where is the good Indonesian restaurant?” I’d say: “It’s here, in my home.” When I was writing books – I’ve written 15 – I’d give parties as a way of recipe-testing. It was a good excuse to do both. I’d put it in my household budget: my party, an anniversary, Roger’s birthday, or just a party for wanting to give a party. You can’t eat everything yourself.I’m now staying in a care home. I’m not quite settled yet. I have a two-bedroom apartment, but hardly any kitchen. I can still cook for the two of us, me and Roger, and I can still give parties. And I can still make my grandmother’s omelette. I don’t think I put enough garlic in my recipe, so when I make it now for myself, I put a lot of coconut, and a lot of garlic and spring onions so it’s garlicky and oniony as well. I’m very fond of my grandmother and her food makes me feel at home. It gives me comfort, a feeling of, “this is what I’m used to”. HONThis is one of my grandmother’s treats for breakfast. It looks like a cake, and to make the omelette thick she used freshly grated coconut, grated potato or sweet potato. And she would add a dollop of her sambal lado to spice it up. I use sambal ulek when I make this omelette at home. It is made by crushing fresh red chillies with a little salt, using a mortar and pestle. It is available ready-made from Asian food stores and supermarkets.If you want coconut but can’t use fresh, you can use desiccated coconut. It’s a bit sweeter and drier, so you need to soak it for a few minutes and include a little of the liquid.Serves 4 for breakfast or as a light lunch with some saladshallots 2, finely slicedgarlic 1 clove, finely slicedsambal ulek 1 tsp or ½ tsp chilli powderfreshly grated coconut or grated potato or sweet potato 100gsalt ½ tspmilk or cold water 1 tbsp duck eggs 6peanut (groundnut) oil 2 tbspMix together all the ingredients, except the eggs and oil, in a large bowl. Then beat the mixture thoroughly with the eggs – it needs more beating than an ordinary omelette and should be quite fluffy.Heat the oil in a wok until hot. (I find a 25cm non-stick frying pan an easier alternative to a wok.) Carefully spoon the oil over the sides, or tilt and turn the wok or pan so the sides are well coated with oil. Pour the omelette mixture into the hot wok or pan, and while it is still liquid swirl it around so that the omelette is not too thick in the centre. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn it over carefully (it should be perfectly circular), and cook slowly for another 3-4 minutes until the middle, which of course is still the thickest part, is firm and the whole omelette is lightly browned. The edges should now be delicately crisp.Serve hot or cold, cut up into slices like a cake.From Indonesian Food by Sri Owen (Pavilion Books, £20). To buy a copy for £17.60, go to bookshopUntil I was 13 or 14, my grandparents owned a Greek-Cypriot restaurant called Dirlandas in Tufnell Park, north London. I was born upstairs and lived there for the first few years of my life. Even after we moved out, the restaurant remained the centre of our universe. My dad worked there, and during Christmas or Easter, when the restaurant was shut, everyone would congregate there to celebrate. It was a proper Cypriot taverna with tablecloths and plastic strip curtains. My grandmother would make stuffed vine leaves from scratch for the mezze. And, of course, it had grills where they cooked steaks, chops and souvlakia.That smell of meat over coals is so evocative but when my grandparents shut the restaurant in the mid-90s it disappeared from my life. Around that time, I became vegetarian. My dad had also given up meat and my mum didn’t eat much of it. But when I started working in food in my early 20s, I began eating meat again. One day, during a shoot for a Jamie Oliver book in Athens, someone was cooking souvlakia on the grills and it was like a slap around the face. Never before had a smell conjured up such strong images and emotions. It was like I was back in my grandparents’ restaurant.My grandparents on both sides moved to England in search of a better quality of life and better opportunities. My mum’s dad was an orphan and so poor that the people in his village outside Nicosia would feed him and give him shoes. When he got married to my granny, they moved to England and he got a job in a Wall’s sausage factory. The manager of the factory lent him the money to open up his first deli in Holloway, and he went from nothing to owning a few shops and houses around London. My dad’s parents moved over a bit later. Before they opened the restaurant, my granddad was a barber and my grandma a seamstress. They’re both still alive. My gran is 79 now and she still cooks for our entire family twice a week. My sister and I helped out at the restaurant, but mostly we got in the way. My gran would get us to fill the salt and pepper shakers, or pod peas and broad beans. Food was the centre of our world. It took me a while to realise that, actually, not all 19-year-olds read cookery books all the time or spend three hours making moussaka on a Saturday night when their friends are out getting drunk.My mum made a lot of Cypriot food at home. Any occasion was a feast. Now I’ve taken over that role. For Greek Easter this year, I had everyone round to mine and spent two days making flaounes, the traditional Cypriot Easter pastries, as taught to me by my gran. I love that I’ll be able to pass these traditions on to my daughter, Persephone – she has no choice!Not only do I want to document my family’s recipes, I also want to preserve a sense of our culture and traditions. In my generation, out of all my cousins, only one other person is interested in food. When my grandma finally passes away, who else is going to keep all these food traditions going?Home means lots of noise and chatter, and it always revolves around cooking. As a housewarming present , my dad bought me my own foukou, the motorised grill used for cooking souvlakia. It’s my pride and joy, and that smell is just amazing. It’s my childhood, it’s my grandparents’ restaurant.

Pick and finely chop the rosemary and thyme leaves and add to the pork. Peel and finely grate in the garlic. Season well, then stir in the olive oil and red wine vinegar and cover. Refrigerate and leave to marinate for at least half an hour, longer if possible. If using wooden skewers be sure to soak them in water first to stop them burning.If you are making chips (see below), get them on the go now.Get the sides ready. To make the mustard sauce, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, honey and mustard to taste. Season to taste, cover and set aside till needed.Chop the tomatoes and peel and finely slice the onion. Mix them together in a bowl and squeeze over the juice of the lemon. Finely chop the parsley and scatter over the top. Set aside until needed.When you are ready to cook, preheat a griddle pan to a high heat (or get your barbecue going). Thread 4 large skewers (or 8 small ones) with the marinated pork, being careful not to push the pieces too close together, so that they cook thoroughly all the way through. Cook the meat on the hot griddle pan for around 10-12 minutes, turning evenly, until they are charred and cooked through. Warm the pita breads on the side of the griddle or barbecue for a few minutes at the end. Serve everything together and let everyone build their own kebabs – but be sure to finish with a sprinkle of paprika.The cucumber is salted and drained, a small step but a key one, as it gives you an intensely creamy dip – it shouldn’t be at all runny.Serves 4-6cucumber 1sea salt and freshly ground black peppergarlic 1 small clovedried mint 1 tspGreek yogurt 500gextra virgin olive oillemon ½Start by draining the cucumber. Trim it and coarsely grate it into a mixing bowl. Mix in 1 teaspoon of flaky sea salt (if using fine sea salt, use ½ teaspoon), then spoon it into a clean, fine sieve. Leave it to drain over the mixing bowl for 1 hour, stirring occasionally to remove all the liquid.When it is ready, spoon it into a larger mixing bowl. Finely grate in the peeled garlic clove and add the dried mint and a good pinch of ground black pepper.Spoon the yogurt into the fine sieve. You don’t want to press it through, just to remove any excess liquid. When it’s drained, spoon it into the bowl with the grated cucumber, drizzle in 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, squeeze in a little lemon juice to taste and mix everything together well. Serve finished with a little drizzle of oil on top and sprinkled with a little extra dried mint.This only makes a small quantity, enough for a few chips in the kebabs. If you want more, to eat alongside your meal, then double or triple the quantity.Preheat your oven to 230Cgas mark 8. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cut the potatoes into chips, around 1cm in thickness. Cook for 2 minutes in the boiling water, then drain in a colander and steam-dry over the hot pan.Place the chips in a large roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Use your hands to toss everything together, making sure that every piece of potato is coated in seasoned oil. Place in the oven for around 35-40 minutes, turning the chips halfway through, until cooked through, golden and crisp all over.From Taverna: Recipes From a Cypriot Kitchen by Georgina Hayden (Square Peg, £25). To buy a copy for £22, go to bookshopWhen I was a kid in Bombay, I tried growing a lime tree in a pot on a windowsill at home and it didn’t work out too well, yielding only one fruit. But now that I live in California, it’s much easier. In Oakland, where I live with my husband, Michael, all the focal points in our back garden are citrus trees – we’ve got makrut lime, bearss lime and the tiny Mexican key lime. I make a point of using limes in my recipes. In India, it’s the citrus you use when you want to add acid to a dish. And in a cobbler – a southern American dish I learned from my mother-in-law in Virginia – lime makes perfect sense with blueberry and ginger as a way of amplifying the flavour.The food I grew up with in Bombay was not very connected. My mother is Catholic and her family comes from Goa, whereas my dad is Hindu from Uttar Pradesh, so her cuisine was more tropical and heavy on coconut, meat and seafood, while his was more vegetarian. Most Indian kids I know were rooted in a single culinary region, but I never had that. I think it makes it easier for me now, as a food writer, because I never worry about things needing to be done in a certain way.My biggest influence was my grandmother on my mother’s side. She showed me a lot of techniques – teaching me to cut vegetables to the same size when making a stock, for example, so everything cooks in a uniform way.I started cooking aged 10 or 11 because I was sick of eating what they were serving at home. But there was an experimental side to it as well. It made me very curious and I’d wonder what would happen if, say, I used vinegar instead of lime. Around that time, I found out that I was gay. I was scared to live in India because I’d heard my parents talking about gay people getting arrested, so I wanted to move to a safer place, and my only way out was through science – chemistry and biology were my strong points. In 2002, I got a scholarship to a college in Cincinnati to study molecular genetics. Six months after moving to America, I came out.A lot of my classmates asked me for Indian food, but after a while I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to cook food that reflected my present as well as my past – and I started writing about this in my blog A Brown Table.California definitely feels like home now. But after 17 years away, does Bombay still feel like home? That’s a hard question. For 12 years I didn’t go back at all. Going to Bombay with my husband Michael for the first time was stressful, at least to begin with, because it brought back all those memories of why I left. I knew my family was fine with me being gay but there were friends and relatives who didn’t know. I didn’t want to hide anything, but thankfully we were there for a wedding and we got completely absorbed in it. The next time there was no wedding, and that was more challenging, but by then India was becoming much more vocal about gay rights, which made things a little easier.India has changed so much. The first week I’m there is fine, but after that I start to feel like I’m out of place. I feel like I’m a stranger in India. That’s when I realise America is more my home now.

Nowhere near enough. Teenage striker Gabriel Martinelli has arrived from regional football in Brazil and is expected to need some adaptation and development time. David Ospina has departed for a modest fee.What do they still need to do? Lots. They are chasing width, defensive reinforcements and a box-to-box midfielder but so far negotiations are proving troublesome. Equally key is the need to shift unwanted players – also troublesome.Budget this summer £40m. Amy LawrenceWhat have they done so far? Been busier than anyone and will soon have spent the best part of £100m. Seven players and counting have signed, reflecting the desire to strengthen a squad that has just won promotion but also fill the many gaps left after a clear-out at the end of last season. Jota, Anwar El Ghazi, Kortney Hause, Matt Targett, Ezri Konsa, Tyrone Mings and Wesley are the new arrivals … so far.What do they still need to do? Douglas Luiz is poised to join from Manchester City and Björn Engels, the Reims defender, could well follow.Budget this summer Approximately £100m. Stuart JamesWhat have they done so far? Eddie Howe has freshened up his back line by again dipping into the Football League to sign the young and versatile defenders Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Jack Stacey, 23, who will compete for the left-back and right-back berths respectively. Fringe players Tyrone Mings, Emerson Hyndman and Connor Mahoney have departed.What do they still need to do? The key will be holding on to their indispensables: Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Nathan Aké. The No 1 shirt remains fairly open Jack Butland is among the goalkeepers of interest while Artur Boruc has signed a new contract to take him beyond his 40th birthday.What have they done so far? Another summer, another club-record fee, with Leandro Trossard an £18m arrival from Genk. Brighton hope the Belgian winger, who scored 17 goals in all competitions last season, will provide further firepower. They have also bolstered their defence with the signing of the talented 22-year-old centre-back Matt Clarke, who was a big hit at Portsmouth.What do they still need to do? With Bruno retiring, links to a loan move for the Chelsea defender Reece James make sense. Keeping Lewis Dunk will be crucial, especially if Graham Potter plans to, as expected, play with a three-man defence. The highly rated Ben White has joined Leeds on loan.What have they done so far? More than this time last year. They have brought Jay Rodriguez home from West Bromwich Albion and signed Erik Pieters from Stoke as cover for Charlie Taylor following the departure of left-back Stephen Ward. Peter Crouch and Jon Walters have both been released.What do they still need to do? Not too much unless Aston Villa succeed in buying goalkeeper Tom Heaton or big offers come in for the teenage winger Dwight McNeil. Sean Dyche is reasonably happy with the balance of his squad.Budget this summer Without sales, up to £20m. Paul WilsonWhat have they done so far? Their only ‘new’ incoming business was Mateo Kovacic’s move from Real Madrid, given Christian Pulisic joined back in January, but they have secured Ruben Loftus-Cheek to new terms. Significantly, though, they have sold Eden Hazard as well as some fringe players and agreed a deal that will take Álvaro Morata to Atlético Madrid permanently at the end of the season.What do they still need to do? They cannot make any further signings given their transfer ban but assessments will be made on which players will depart on loan.Budget this summer Not really applicable. Dominic FifieldWhat have they done so far? Sold Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United for around £45m, parted with a few experienced squad players under freedom of contract (Jason Puncheon, Julián Speroni and Bakary Sako) and recruited Stephen Henderson from Nottingham Forest as third-choice goalkeeper.What do they still need to do? Deflect Arsenal’s interest and somehow appease Wilfried Zaha to stay, and secure Luka Milivojevic to new terms. Jordan Ayew is close to signing permanently from Swansea, but the club will still strive to secure a new right-back, striker and a creative forward. They will need many more if Zaha does leave.Budget this summer The money raised through Wan-Bissaka’s sale, and the leeway granted to the wage bill by the flurry of quieter departures. DFWhat have they done so far? Turning André Gomes’ loan spell into a permanent stay was a priority for Marco Silva and achieved with minimum fuss for a reasonable fee. Jonas Lössl has also arrived on a free from relegated Huddersfield as backup to first-choice goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford.Budget this summer Not as substantial as previous summers and there is a need to reduce the wage bill. Andy HunterWhat have they done so far? Some impressive business, most notably the club-record signing of Youri Tielemans from Monaco for a fee of around £40m. Tielemans, who was superb on loan last season, appears to be a real coup for Leicester. They have also signed Ayoze Pérez from Newcastle for £30m to add more goals to the team and paid Luton £6m for James Justin, a highly rated 21-year-old right-back.What do they still need to do? Hold on to Harry Maguire, which will be easier said than done, and find homes for a number of out-of-favour, highly paid fringe players. Adding another midfielder is also a possibility.Budget this summer Approximately £100m. SJWhat have they done so far? Very little from a position of strength as European champions. Liverpool invested heavily last year – on new faces and new contracts for existing stars – and have so far concentrated on young talent such as 17-year-old defender Sepp van den Berg and 16-year-old Harvey Elliott.What do they still need to do? There are no glaring weaknesses to address in a team that gathered 97 points plus the Champions League last season although defensive cover is required, especially if Dejan Lovren departs.Budget this summer Last year’s world record profit was reinvested in Jürgen Klopp’s squad plus the new £50m training complex under construction in Kirkby, but the manager will be backed if his first-choice targets become available. AHWhat have they done so far? Triggered Rodri’s €65m release clause to take the 23-year-old defensive midfielder from Atlético Madrid. Decided Leicester City’s £75m-plus valuation of Harry Maguire is too much (for the moment).What do they still need to do? Resolve the Maguirecentre-back situation following Vincent Kompany’s departure.What have they done so far? Began promisingly with the signing of two 21-year-olds: pacey winger, Daniel James, who cost £15m from Swansea City and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, a swift right-back for £45m from Crystal Palace.What do they still need to do? Buy a centre-back – Harry Maguire is the prime target – and solve the Paul Pogba headache: there is less than four weeks left of the window so, if he is to leave, Ole Gunnar Solskjær needs to find a replacement quickly. The same equation is true of the wantaway striker Romelu Lukaku.Budget £100m plus funds generated from any player sales. JJWhat have they done so far? Precisely nothing on the incoming front, having been without a manager since the departure of Rafa Benítez. New signings are said to be in the pipeline once the vacancy has been filled and straightaway the new manager must set to work replacing goalscorers Ayoze Pérez and Salomón Rondón and out-of-contract midfielder Mohamed Diamé.What do they still need to do? Find out how much money is available for strengthening. The £30m raised from the sale of Pérez could double if Sean Longstaff joins Manchester United, but that does not mean the new manager will be granted a war-chest and free rein.Budget Possibly £30m. Even Mike Ashley must realise players need to be replaced. PWWhat have they done so far? An understudy for Teemu Pukki has arrived in the shape of Swiss forward Josep Drmic. There is also competition for Tim Krul in goal with the signing of long-standing Schalke No 1 Ralf Fährmann. Norwich have also taken Manchester City’s Patrick Roberts on loan, the winger having previously starred for CelticWhat do they still need to do? Top targets are a first-choice defensive midfielder, and cover for youngster Max Aarons at right-back. But there remains expectation that another forward may yet be acquired and Hull’s Jarrod Bowen and Málaga’s Javier Ontiveros have been linked.Budget this summer £35m. Paul MacInnesWhat have they done so far? Luke Freeman arrived from QPR for a club-record fee in excess of £4m and then the Blades broke their transfer record again for the Preston forward Callum Robinson. Phil Jagielka has returned on a free, 12 years after he departed the club for Everton. Ravel Morrison has been on trial.What do they still need to do? More firepower remains key with Brentford’s Neal Maupay and Swansea’s Ollie McBurnie the top targets – both would cost in excess of £10m. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson is set to return on loan from Manchester United and further midfield options are needed, with Nottingham Forest’s Ben Osborn and Coventry’s Tom Bayliss on the radar.Budget Not huge. Chris Wilder will probably have to break the club’s transfer record again over the summer but he will be shopping in League One and the Championship. John AshdownWhat have they done so far? They have made the loan of Danny Ings from Liverpool permanent and added Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo – two attacking players that fit the Ralph Hasenhüttl prototype, being young, fast, intelligent and comfortable with a high-pressing style. They have recouped £14m by selling Matt Targett to Aston Villa.What do they still need to do? Hasenhüttl is likely to add a couple more but he could be more active with outgoing business. The club will listen to offers for Fraser Forster, Wesley Hoedt, Jordy Clasie (who will return to Holland), Mario Lemina, Sofiane Boufal, Charlie Austin and Guido Carrillo.Budget The club’s Chinese owners oversaw a profit on transfers from their first three windows. Balanced books are their rationale. David HytnerWhat have they done so far? They have made a good start, signing Mauricio Pochettino’s No 1 target – the midfielder Tanguy Ndombele – for a club-record £55m and also adding the winger Jack Clarke, although he has been loaned back to Leeds.What do they still need to do? Pochettino wants to add the Fulham left-sided player, Ryan Sessegnon and, ideally, an attack-minded midfielder but much will now depend on generating funds, meaning that the situation of the wantaway midfielder, Christian Eriksen, is pivotal. While Eriksen is in limbo, so are Spurs.Budget See above. They have already more than spent it. They could raise further funds by selling Toby Alderweireld andor Kieran Trippier. DHWhat have they done so far? The only senior signings are the 38-year-old goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, not exactly a new face but certainly a popular one, who was convinced to postpone his retirement for a year, and the 29-year-old centre-back Craig Dawson, who arrived from West Brom for a fee of about £5m. There have also been a handful additions to the development squad, including the former Arsenal defender Bayli Spencer-Adams and the 19-year-old Leeds striker Sam Dalby.What do they still need to do? The priorities at the start of the window were to augment central defence and to add pace and width in attack. Further defensive signings are possible but the focus of late has been on Ismaïla Sarr, the 21-year-old Rennes winger. Sarr is reportedly willing to join, though a fee has yet to be agreed with his club and the player’s participation with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations has complicated the transfer.What have they done so far? Pablo Fornals was an exciting addition – the attacking midfielder joined for £24m from Villarreal and helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championships last month – but all was quiet until Marko Arnautovic kicked up another stink and forced a move to Shanghai SIPG.What they need to do? Sign a striker. The sale of Arnautovic leaves a gaping hole up front and there is growing anxiety after Maxi Gómez snubbed them to join Valencia. West Ham have since turned their attention to Eintracht Frankfurt’s Sébastien Haller and have also been linked with a loan move for Gonzalo Higuaín of Juventus.What have they done so far? On the face of it very little. There is an argument that Raúl Jiménez and Leander Dendoncker are new signings (listed as such on the Premier League website), but it was April when Wolves triggered a pre-agreed option to make the Mexican’s loan permanent, and there was an obligation to buy in last summer’s loan agreement for the Belgium international. Either way, Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolves manager, wants to bring in up to four new players. So far, an inflated transfer market has left the club frustrated.What do they still need to do? Add quality to a thin squad that will be stretched by Europa League participation. That said, Nuno prefers to operate with only 18 first-team players. Another striker and centre-back would seem to be priorities.Budget Hard to say, approximately £60m.

We’re speaking over FaceTime, and this is a quiet morning in Los Angeles for her. Her writers are about to turn up and start working on season four of Better Things, the neat, witty and often beautiful comedy loosely based on Adlon’s own life. As soon as she’s finished ordering lunch for her team, and sage to cleanse the energy of the office – this is the West Coast, after all – she leaps up and launches straight into a virtual tour. She shows me the lanterns that make the place cosy, and an old black-and-white picture of her English mother wearing her Canadian Air Force uniform. There’s a record player and a shelf full of vinyl. “Look at this!” she yells, as we whizz past a piece of paper taped on to a door that reads CRYING ROOM. “You know, you just need a room where you can go and cry,” she shrugs. “We got these movie theatre seats, and it has chargers, and here is a little pedal bike and there’s an African chair I got at a flea market.” She makes me promise not to read the board on the wall behind her, where the plots are being worked out. “Stop it!” she shouts, grinning. “Cover your eyes!”Adlon spends a lot of time in this inner sanctum. She writes and directs Better Things, the show she created about Sam Fox, whom she plays, a single mother who is a jobbing actor raising her three daughters in LA, just like she is. (Its first season ran in the UK earlier this year the second, a low-key candidate for best comedy on TV, is about to begin.) Quietly brilliant, it is an unsentimental look at family life and working single mothers – blunt, warm, fascinated by the absurdity of trying to hold it all together. Which, it turns out, is exactly what Adlon is like in real life. At times, trying to keep her on track in a conversation can be like filling a leaky bucket. “That is probably not what you asked me. I tend to go off the rails,” she says at one point, segueing from a story about selling all of her possessions in her 20s to her mother being born during the Blitz.The show, which does not shy away from the difficulties of raising three young women under one roof, or looking after an elderly and increasingly dotty mother who lives next door, is often described as “raw”. “I like raw,” Adlon protests. “I prefer raw to ‘brave’. When people are like, ‘You’re so brave...’” She grabs a fistful of her legs. She has no qualms about appearing on screen in her pants. “I tell my girlfriends, that’s what real thighs look like. I’m like: brave, bitch! So brave.”Better Things is about finding the humour and the heart in orce, death, bad decisions, in not having enough time for your kids or your work, in having to grind to get by. “I think the theme throughout the show is, there’s hope and there’s love and there’s laughter, amidst all this dark shit, you know? There’s a flower growing up through a turd,” she explains, succinctly. “I like to feel hope, and I like to laugh at things that are dark. You need somebody in your life, if you’re having the worst possible fucking day, to laugh at you. To point at you and say, ‘Oh bro, that’s hysterical.’”In the past, Adlon has called Better Things “semi-autobiographical”. Today she is measured about the similarities between the show and her life. “Well, I have three daughters, I’m a single mom, I have an English mother, I’m an actor,” she shrugs – but she also admits that she has spent her whole life watching, writing things down, gathering material to use. Her eccentric English mother, played by Celia Imrie, loves being written into the series. “Because when I tell her, ‘Mom, you’re being extra sassy right now,’ she says, ‘You love it! You get more material for your show.’” She nods. “I can’t argue.”She was at the gym with her friend recently. “And she’s literally the most miserable person in the world. She starts talking, and she’s crying, and crying. And I turn to the woman next to me and I go, ‘You know why she’s crying? Cos her husband just left her. Two kids. She’s almost 50.’ And she’s working out, and she starts laughing hysterically, through her tears. Isn’t it hilarious?” She laughs. “I shouldn’t even tell you this, because I’m making it a scene in the show.” Another friend told her recently that she’d always assumed Adlon wasn’t listening to her. “And then she saw my show, and she said, ‘I realise you’re really listening.’ I’m surprised that people don’t tread more lightly around me.”Now 52, Adlon has been a professional actor since she was 10. She was a child star in a popular US sitcom The Facts of Life, and appeared alongside Lorna Luft and Michelle Pfeiffer as a wisecracking kid sister in Grease 2. For the most part, she says, she felt protected in those environments. But talking about those years brings back memories. There was an independent film and a scene in a swimming pool. “And the director said, ‘Wouldn’t it be funny if you dropped the towel for a minute, and we saw your butt, just for a minute?’ And I was 15 years old. I had to kiss a boy in that movie, too, and I hadn’t done that. And I remember being really uncomfortable and feeling scared, because what are the parameters? The kid actor looked at me and said, ‘An apple is an apple, a plum is a plum, a kiss isn’t a kiss without the tongue.’ And I was just gutted.”It was a shock to go from being famous and on television as a kid to being in her 20s, on unemployment benefits, having to sell her possessions. The loss of her record collection, in particular, still smarts. “Oh! Do you have to bring that up? I’m still upset. I can see the records,” she says. But she realised that, with her unique smoke and honey voice, she could earn her living another way. “I started hitting it in voiceover and animation,” she explains, which sustained her for much of her career her biggest voice job was as Bobby in King of the Hill. In the new season of Better Things, she has a character say, “I know you were Rooster on Ching of the Mill.” “It’s so stupid,” she says. “I didn’t even bother making up a new title.”Like Sam Fox, Adlon is a jobbing actor, and her work rate has been so prodigious that her CV has the heft of a weighty novel: “No job too big or small, is my motto, and every single job led me to where I am.” She spent several years as Marcy Runkle in Californication, the explicit, hedonistic Showtime series, where she played a foul-mouthed wisecracker who regularly shot off insults like “Die young and suffer, dickless.” When her eldest daughter, Gideon, was starting a new school, Adlon told her: “There’s gonna be people who watch the show, and it’s a show for adults.” She didn’t want the kids to watch it just because their friend’s mother was in it. “But what an innocent time that was! Because now the shit that kids watch on their phones and everything? Forget it!” She remembers a parent coming up to her, with her 12-year-old and nine-year-old in tow. “They said, ‘Oh Pamela, we watch your show, we love it.’” She cackles. “And I said, ‘You’re kidding?’ And she said, ‘No no, we love it.’ And then her little nine-year-old was like, ‘Yah, it’s really good.’ I looked at her and said: ‘The show is not for kids.’” She slips into stern parent mode. “I mean, how do you explain ‘stunt cock’ to your nine-year-old daughter?” she says. “Fuckin’ asshole.”Around the same time as Californication, Adlon was working closely with her friend and collaborator Louis CK on his series Lucky Louie and Louie. He later returned production and writing favours on the first two seasons of Better Things. Then allegations of sexual misconduct against CK surfaced in 2017, and Adlon found herself caught in the crossfire, her own show hanging in the balance through its association with him. She spoke about how “devastating” it was in an interview with the New Yorker, but the only condition of this conversation was that we wouldn’t bring him up today. One of the more peculiar aspects of the #MeToo groundswell has been women being asked to answer for men’s transgressions it seems reasonable to not ask her to do so again. Besides, Better Things did not exactly sink without CK, who was not involved in season three. When Adlon took sole charge, critics praised it for finding its voice and a new sense of invention.Adlon is a single mother she got married in the mid-90s, and orced a decade ago. Her ex-husband, the father of her kids, moved to Europe. “I don’t talk about him,” she says, in a rare closed moment, though she leans into the screen, and adds: “Really not convenient for drop-offs on the weekend, and stuff like that.” She always knew that she had Better Things in her, but it took her years to feel ready to go ahead and make it, in part because she was raising three young children alone.“I had to say no to a lot of things, because I did not want to take on more than I could handle,” she says. The final push came when she was working on a big budget, big network television show – she won’t tell me the name of it, but will say, “It was fuckin’ awful, a circling-the-drain, terrible, American television show” – and a Friday turned into a Saturday, and it was midnight, and they still hadn’t finished half of what they were supposed to. “Ice water went through my veins and it was like, ‘Don’t these people have families? What the fuck are they doing?’ That was the moment that I thought, I’m ready. I’m ready to do this.”Her three daughters, now 21, 18 and 16, are “incredibly proud” of her. “They see their mom being a boss and running a show, and hiring a ton of people, and how important this job is to so many people. It’s absolutely an unbelievable situation. To see their mom really make it big when she hit 50, after kind of just middling the line for so long...” This seems to go against the traditional Hollywood narrative, that women have an expiration date. “I think it’s still true, but it’s less true,” Adlon says. “I think that if you can make yourself viable, anything is possible.” She does, however, think she should have started directing sooner. “I wish I hadn’t just stayed in one lane for so long. That bothers me, that I was myopic in that way. Now I have six jobs, and I wish that I had kind of committed to doing that, instead of, oh, I only act.”Still, she is a firm believer in everything happening for a reason. There is an earth mother warmth to Adlon, and it’s not just the sage, or the crying room. She has taken her own industry experiences and used them to ensure that the patterns are not repeated. “All of those things really helped me,” she explains. “So for example, when I did Californication, there were so many young women who came on the show, and they had to do nudity, or do a simulated sex scene, or make out. And so I just made it my mission to try and soothe people and talk them through it and say, don’t do anything you don’t feel comfortable with, or don’t be ashamed, or love your body now, but don’t ever get pushed into doing something you don’t want to do.” The number one priority on Better Things, she says, is that “I would never ask somebody to do something that I wouldn’t do myself, and that they wouldn’t feel safe or comfortable doing.”Adlon is such a nurturer that by the end of our conversation, when she’s introduced me to her assistant Ryan, and we’ve had a chat about his life, and how seeing Adlon run her own show while also looking after her daughters made him call his own mother more, and Adlon has introduced me to her writers, including Patricia Resnick (“She wrote 9 to 5!” she yells, proudly), I find myself asking her how she stays so hopeful in a world that seems to discourage it at every turn. I want to know how she finds the flower in the turd. She falls back into her chair. “Ryan told me about how this one organisation has figured out a way to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. And I was like, ‘Well I was reading about how these teenagers figured out how to break down styrofoam.’ So it’s these little things. These little things! And you know, my kids are so aware. My youngest daughter is going to DC in December for a week with the ACLU and her platform is women’s reproductive rights, and justice. My 16-year-old. It makes me wanna cry.” She tears up, not for the first time hope makes her emotional. “You’ve got to have hope,” she insists. “If humanity doesn’t have hope, there’s nothing to live for.” She stops talking. There is a perfect pause.“Wow,” she hoots. “I sound like an asshole. Wowwww.”Season two of Better Things starts on Wednesday 17 July at 10pm on BBC Two."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b729f71078c783b8c63ac4dd66a631baa524bd51/0_281_1836_1101/master/1836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d49470b5d5ae752783ede289f5c1ab7c","title":"cleaning up the truth about living with nannies and cleaners","story":"‘I hid from the truth about the domestic workers who ran my home, but finally I had to tell their story’The first time I paid another woman to clean my apartment, it felt like an experiment. I was 24, and I’d recently started a job as a national correspondent for a big newspaper. The assignment came with professional trappings and freedoms I’d never had before: a stylish office in a downtown skyscraper, a full-time research assistant, a travel budget that never seemed to run dry.It was a man who put me up to calling a house cleaner. I’d made the mistake of mentioning that I had to clean my house. He laughed. “Why are you doing your own cleaning? Hire somebody.”“I don’t do that,” I said. His next words stuck in my brain forever. “Your time is worth money, you know. It’s worth more money than you’re going to pay somebody to clean your house.” Your time is worth money. This is a common platitude, but nobody had ever applied it to me and, hearing it, I was electrified. The jobs I’d worked since adolescence – barista, grocery clerk, farm worker – had taught the opposite lesson: that my time was only worth what I could earn with physical labour. I badly wanted to believe it was true, that my journalistic efforts had been enough to carry me across that invisible borderline separating the hirees from the hirers. And so I called a housekeeping agency and booked a cleaner.The experience was demoralising. Her car shuddered to the curb. Her skinny shoulders slumped. She hardly looked at me. Everything about the sullen, middle-aged woman who lugged her bucket and scrubbing brushes into my living room seemed to speak – no, scream – of a downtrodden existence. She cleaned the house meticulously and then I paid her and she went away, leaving me to pace my shining floors in muddled shame and confusion. That night I went to a party and explained my funk to a writer who was a kind of mentor. Her response was immediate and visceral: I should not feel guilty. It was imperative that I not feel guilty. “I don’t know how your family came to this country, but mine came here and cleaned houses to survive,” she said. “It’s decent work and there’s no reason to feel bad about it.”That was all I needed to hear. From that moment, the two pillars of justification were firmly fixed in my mind: my time was valuable enough that I should spend money to protect it, and there was no stigma around housework – and therefore no harm in getting someone else to do it. I leaned on these two ideas all through my single life and on into marriage, as I moved around the world and hired various people to clean my house while I roamed around writing news stories. I didn’t feel guilty and everything worked fine – right up until the babies came.My husband and I were living in China when, pregnant with my first child, I quit my job to write a book at home. This sounded easy – even idyllic – until I was slapped with the messy, sleep-deprived reality of life with a newborn. The baby was colicky. My husband’s job kept him on the road more often than not. I needed help, but there were no relatives down the road or lifelong friends within reach. There were no day care centres or teenage babysitters. Instead, there were migrant female workers whose full-time salaries were less expensive than day care back in the US. It was a no-brainer.Determined that motherhood wouldn’t put a stop to my work, I hired a young woman called Xiao Li to clean and cook and babysit. What did I know about Xiao Li when she first walked through the door? Practically nothing, and that was fine with me. I knew she had a husband and an apartment somewhere. I knew her daughter had been entrusted to the care of grandparents. In the beginning, I didn’t ask many questions. As an exhausted and overwhelmed new mother, I had problems of my own. Every day I wondered two things: whether I was about to have a nervous breakdown, and whether I had permanently undone my life as a writer. I saw Xiao Li as my best hope for salvation, and so naturally I wanted to believe that she had no problems of her own.Xiao Li took the bus across the city every day, carrying lunch in plastic boxes and hot water in a thermos. At noon she scarfed her food on a straight-backed wooden chair we’d shoved between the counter and the inlaid microwave in our tiny kitchen. Then she’d bend her neck into an improbable twist, rest her cheek on the countertop and fall asleep. The first time, I woke her up and tried to convince her to lie down on the couch or the guest bed. She blinked and blushed, but stayed put. In those early weeks, I didn’t dwell on the unsettling knowledge that a small girl had been left in a village because Xiao Li couldn’t afford childcare. I made no effort to discover whether Xiao Li’s lifestyle – the migration to Beijing, the job in my house – was a grand adventure or a heartbreaking drudgery, or some combination. I had the vague idea that my silence was magnanimous. I told myself that, by not prying, I was sparing her embarrassment. But I think I always knew, on some sublimated level, that I was really sparing myself.As months went by my fondness for Xiao Li grew into a dependence. I trusted her. The baby loved her. Her presence in the house made me feel steady.But her circumstances were always fragile. Her daughter was hospitalised with heart problems and Xiao Li got pregnant, missing countless days of work. Even when she came, she was sick and exhausted. I was forced to stop writing and accept that my circumstances were tangled up with Xiao Li’s life – when she couldn’t work, nor could I.Xiao Li stopped working in deference to her advancing pregnancy. Another woman took her place. Then I got pregnant again. We left China and moved to India. I drafted one book and started another. Life moved, children grew. The women were there, too, not part of our family but participating nonetheless in the rise and fall of domestic life in private rooms. Solving problems and causing them affecting and being affected.There was Mary, who was younger than me but had survived several lifetimes – an orphan raised by nuns a widowed mother who’d never had the chance to live with her children a migrant from the Himalayas who couldn’t trace her exact origins and seemed to know everyone in Delhi. Pooja, one of the best cooks I’ve ever known, who taught us about Hindu mythology and Bollywood cinema and how to treat eye ailments by staring at the colour green.These women brought cleanliness, order and home-cooked meals. They had superstitions and home remedies and nursery rhymes in languages I couldn’t speak. They were marked by a gritty optimism that I hoped would rub off on our kids. Mostly they brought love, which they lavished on our children – love dammed and redirected love they might have spent on their own babies. Love we rented away.They brought sinister burdens, too: typhoid and alcoholism and con artists. “Husbands” turned out to be boyfriends and later revealed wives stashed elsewhere. There were men who raged and beat and exploited who disappeared without a word. Our house was an enclosed landscape of working mothers. The women working for us had traded time with their children in exchange for the money needed to keep them out of poverty. As for my husband and me, we were buying back our time.This was a universal story, and I started to write about the complex lacings that bound us together. That meant reporting on my own household and documenting the truths I’d once tried not to think about. I’d turned my house into a job site where we all arranged and rearranged our time and money to protect ourselves and our children. We failed all the time, but kept fumbling along – a strange choreography repeated in households all over the world, unexamined and poorly understood. It’s relegated to invisibility, therefore ripe for exploitation. It seems to me that wilful ignorance is a defining feature of our time. But when you employ a domestic worker, you bring a slice of inequality into your kitchen.I uncovered hard realities: poverty and shame more extreme than I’d realised the unsolvable heartache of leaving children secrets of mistreatment. There was dignity and joy, and all the other layers of complication and contradiction that weave their way through every biography. I didn’t come up with an indictment against or a justification for hiring domestic workers, nor was I seeking a neat political conclusion. It was the full, messy truth I was after. I wanted to know the stories of my house the outcome of the money I’d paid the nature of the work that made my own possible. To stop and collect the stories – this seemed the very least we could do.

But this week, its wiggle appeared to wane. A certain weariness had set in. Is this the end of wellness?The same day that Goop fans revolted, a wellness company called Get a Drip withdrew a £250 “fertility drip” from sale after experts accused them of exploiting vulnerable women. They specialise in intravenous drips of vitamins, with customers reportedly feeling more “alive” when they leave, despite doctors pointing out there’s no scientific evidence they have meaningful impact, that the risks outweigh the benefits, and that they should be used only for people unable to absorb nutrients through their gastrointestinal tract – saying that any positive reaction is due to a placebo effect.It’s one thing to market IV drips that claim to brighten your skin or make your hair look glossier. It’s quite another, argued Katherine O’Brien at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, to tell the one in seven couples in the UK that have trouble conceiving, that there is a “quick fix at an extortionate cost”. “There is no evidence that an IV drip of any combination of vitamins can improve a woman’s fertility,” she said. “In promising hope to women at a very desperate time, we are concerned that, aside from providing no real benefit, these drips may be causing real damage to women’s emotional wellbeing.”The wellness industry thrives due to a collection of complementary ideas, blended hard into a thick juice. One is the alluring mystique of nature, compared with the cold arrogance of Western medicine and its relentless evidence wellness cures are rarely proven to fail because they can rarely be proven to work. Another is the new idea that health, a place of painless calm and joy, a sort of inner Center Parcs, is the body’s natural state, with any ersion from this an aberration that must be corrected. There is the celebration of wellness in glossy media, with its celebrities and plentiful lifestyle accessories, from crystals to large jade eggs. And there is a gendered claw, with a combination of feminist tropes – the idea that women’s health is misunderstood and the medical establishment ignorant about our bodies – and a sly regifting of the diet industry, this time with detox plans and slimming drips.It’s hard to fight miraculous cures to nebulous problems with dull, unphotogenic but science-based solutions. But for every new wellness fad – activated charcoal, pink salt, placenta smoothies – there is a noisy, science-based argument debunking it, and increased responsibility from trusted institutions who understand more care is required when representing magical thinking and its premier philosophers. And too, growing acknowledgement of the reasons these quick fixes appeal to so many people, especially those with busy lives and limited healthcare, especially those who have grown up being told that life can be perfected.

Partially organised by word of mouth, partially through WhatsApp, we have arrived ready at the meeting point – the bottom of a windmill famous for featuring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.It’s a friendly, chatty, hotchpotch crowd. If I squint, I think this might just be how the halcyon days of rave first came about. It might – except that I’m here with the Berkshire Young Ramblers and we’re going on a five-mile hike. Walking, I mumble unconvincingly, is the new raving ... isn’t it?Last year the trend forecasters WGSN predicted that hiking would become the biggest new fitness trend of 2019. Buoyed by fashion houses including Gucci and Louis Vuitton putting walking boots on the catwalk and a proliferation of young models – your Hadids and Jenners – posing in Californian canyons, style blogs declared hiking to be officially hot.That may have come as news for anyone spending their lifetime using their feet unfashionably, but the stats bear it out: while going out-out has undergone a generational decline, going to the great outdoors has seen a marked uptick among millennials.Social media undeniably creates homophilous bubbles of people, but the cultural shift has been perceptible – Instagram is filled with photos of beautiful craggy coastlines taken by an array of young, part-time hedonists: part-time hikers. My own feed features a fashion editor friend who spent her last pre-baby holiday climbing the peaks of Mallorca. A former editor of Vice at her happiest scaling Devil’s Dyke. Music journalists on mountains. An artist documenting their wild desert walks. A twentysomething club kid besotted with the Jurassic coast. My own amateur adventures into nature have become so frequent in the last three years that I’ve set up a separate Instagram account just to stop spamming my friends with endless postcards of endless vistas.User research confirms that walking has become a widespread hobby.Chris Lines, who has more than 20 years’ experience working with the outdoor brand Berghaus and the It’s Great Out There Coalition, says the surge of interest in the outdoors ties into broader consumer trends: we want to enhance our lives with greater experiences rather than more stuff. More memories, fewer hangovers. “The attraction has especially grown in the last decade,” he says, “because people want to get away from the hustle and bustle of an increasingly frenetic daily life in the city. Everyone is surrounded by technology and ‘on’ all the time getting outdoors is a chance to put that down and reconnect with nature. It’s a mental escape as much as a physical one – and it’s good for you.”Laura Doling, 25, is a keen champion. “Everyone talks about mental health a lot, but I think, massively for young people, it’s a great outlet to be in the hills in solitude,” she says. “Everything else becomes insignificant when I’m walking the world carries on and it slows everything down.” Doling grew up in Jaywick, Essex, which is regularly named as one of the most deprived towns in Britain. She graduated with a first in sports science and worked in healthcare before quitting to become a Royal Mail postwoman. After finding a community of like-minded young adventurers on Instagram, she engineered a job transfer to the Lake District and now spends all day walking the fells. Her following online includes brands keen to use her influence to encourage more young people to explore nature and get active.“I did the clubbing scene,” she says. “I don’t think it’s healthy, and I think it’s a waste of money. I can go out at a weekend and camp out in the hills, where you sit and have a decent conversation. It takes away from the superficial problem of worrying what you look like or what you’re wearing.”Doling’s friend Nic Hardy, who describes herself as Instagram’s hiking social secretary, agrees. An IT project manager from Sheffield, Hardy quit her job and sold her house to walk, trek, ramble and mountaineer full time. “I’ve pretty much sold all my stuff or given it away and kept a few sentimental items at my mum’s. I drive around in my estate car and have everything I need I’m 34 and I’ve never felt happier.” By flagging up her walks on Instagram, Hardy has forged a community of young walkers who regularly organise expeditions and learn from one another. “I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who was awkward or not friendly and I’ve made so many lifelong friends.”That walking is meditative and healing is no secret. Where Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson offered literary treatises on its transcendental properties, scientific studies have confirmed that spending time outdoors in green spaces is good for you. Last month a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports found that people who spend two hours a week or more outdoors reported a greater sense of wellbeing. The month before, Forestry England compiled data from a string of studies to prove that being around trees improves mood and attention , and enhances stress recovery. News that walking in nature aids creativity is not new. The challenge is to get more people to realise that it’s easy – and belongs to everyone.“The industry is waking up to the fact that it needs to look and feel more inclusive and a lot more could and should be done,” says Lines. “Especially as the barrier to entry is so low – you just need to go out for a walk. There are no costs to that.”After all, you can only be what you can see and, subconsciously, plenty of us have grown up in families assuming that outdoor adventuring is, well, for white people. To that end, Lines works to lobby for grants to fund projects “designed to give young people a lifelong love of the outdoors, reaching erse communities that haven’t traditionally been targeted”. Berghaus, he says, already does some of this work. Meanwhile North Face has established an “explorer fund … to create access and equity in the outdoors”.But organised group walking isn’t for everyone. Plenty of us – by which I mean me – prefer a more ad hoc approach. Three years ago, after becoming free of flatmates for the very first time, I began walking home from everywhere in London and felt better, lighter, happier. A trip to Pakistan incorporated daily five-mile walks. A meander through the woods here, a three-hour stroll across the beach there followed.Last summer, after more than a decade of pinballing through gigs and grotty parties together, my best friend fixed us a dream holiday: a week of walking along the Normandy coast, a single backpack each. Dorks on walks we may be, but she – the more committed and inspiring of us both – insists it’s ridiculous to describe her as a “walker”.“It still sounds like something people in their middle age do. I’m never getting the sticks,” she says. “Going walking and getting into nature is just about getting away from the city. You’ve got to get far enough away from London to feel disconnected and get the views.”To paraphrase Jean Jacques Rousseau, it’s easier to meditate while walking. “When I stop, I cease to think my mind only works with my legs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d7a06bbe33955b1614ec9c8b3d3ee8d13565c9d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e556f3ea58d50c640d438eb40bddd7c1","title":"how to chew your food properly","story":"Digestion starts in the mouth so, to avoid overburdening your stomach, it is important to chew food well. A nutritionist gives some helpful adviceYou should chew your food until it is small enough to swallow easily, so your stomach does not have to work too hard. Digestion starts in the mouth.Saliva contains amylase, the enzyme that helps to chemically break down food. There is also mechanical digestion, the physical action of breaking down food. If food does not stay in the mouth long enough, it is not exposed to amylase to break down the carbohydrates – there is very little carbohydrate digestion in the stomach, and if food gets there without being properly digested, the stomach has to work harder. There are also some things the stomach cannot digest. If bits of food enter the top of your small intestine still quite whole, it can lead to bloating and discomfort.Rather than advising an absolute number of times to chew your food, I recommend people put their food or cutlery down between mouthfuls – then, when you have finished chewing and swallowing, pick up your cutlery and take the next mouthful. There is something that invites urgency when you have a fork full of food in front of your face, waiting to go into your mouth, which makes you think you need to finish your food more quickly. Just putting your cutlery down between mouthfuls can give you a sense of when the food has been chewed enough.Jo Travers, nutritionist at the London Nutritionist and the author of The Low-Fad Diet, was speaking to Tolani Idris"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/221d4e0e1889b3170b6f5d015b7db17661605037/816_30_1629_977/master/1629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de5506ef0eabc17f445b5d4b75e20a9b","title":"suspected leaker of kim darroch emails identified report","story":"GCHQ reportedly to join police investigation, as Mail publishes further leaks about Iran deal The suspect behind the leak of confidential memos from Britain’s ambassador to the US has been identified, it has been reported, as fresh details of their content was published.Sir Kim Darroch resigned last week after the Mail on Sunday published extracts from the memos, in which he described Donald Trump’s administration as “clumsy and inept”. The politan police’s counter-terrorism command launched a criminal investigation on Friday, and on Sunday, the Sunday Times, citing unnamed government sources, reported that a suspect had been identified and the possibility of a computer hack by a foreign state ruled out.“They think they know who did the leaking,” the paper quoted an unnamed government source as saying. “It’s now a case of building a case that will stand up in court. It was someone with access to historical files. They went in and grabbed a range of material. It was quite crude.”Both the Sunday Times and the Mail on Sunday reported that intelligence officials from GCHQ were about to join the investigation, to attempt to find the suspect by examining email and phone records.Announcing the police investigation on Friday, Met assistant commissioner Neil Basu warned media organisations that they could be breaking the law if they published further details from the cables.However, the Mail on Sunday published more details on Sunday, quoting Darroch accusing Donald Trump of abandoning the nuclear deal with Iran out of spite towards his predecessor Barack Obama.On Saturday, the Met rowed back from its threat that journalists could face prosecution if they published further leaked diplomatic cables after widespread criticism – including from Johnson, and his rival for the Conservative leadership, Jeremy Hunt – that the force was attacking press freedom. Basu clarified that the Met “respects the rights of the media and has no intention of seeking to prevent editors from publishing stories in the public interest in a liberal democracy”.A spokesman for the Mail on Sunday said it was continuing to publish details from the leaks because it contained “important information about how Britain tried, but failed, to stop President Trump abandoning the Iran nuclear deal. What could be more in the public interest than a better understanding of how this position was reached, which may have serious consequences for world peace?”A Foreign Office spokesman said: “A police inquiry into the totally unacceptable leak of this sensitive material has begun. The perpetrator should face the consequences of their actions.“It’s not news that the US and UK differ in how to ensure Iran is never able to acquire a nuclear weapon but this does underline that we do not shy away from talking about our differences and working together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef4fa07b0d0dca4965e3c76d8c7225bf8f5e526/0_15_2356_1413/master/2356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16b446f6d183b3f2fbe855b5e7935e12","title":"how do we tackle this contempt for honest reporting","story":"From Saudi Arabia to the UK, misinformation is fuelling hostility towards journalistsShortly after the BBC director general Tony Hall last week warned of increased threats facing journalists, notably in places such as China and Nigeria, protesters attacked a BBC news crew in Westminster.The fracas, in which supporters of Tommy Robinson, furious with his jail sentence stopped a live BBC news broadcast, was an almost perfect illustration of how, in Hall’s words, “reporting the news has never been more dangerous”. Not because the attack, largely carried out it seems by a man wielding a tripod, left anyone seriously hurt, but because such violence has spread to parts of the world where the freedom to report has for generations, been considered an inalienable right.During a two day Foreign Office-hosted conference, Lord Hall told of BBC staff being arrested or harassed around the world.A day later, a senior police officer in Britain’s biggest police force threatened journalists with arrest for printing government leaks of the Kim Darroch memos, a state of affairs more common in authoritarian states such as Russia.Threats such as this from the politan Police counter-terrorism chief, Neil Basu, thrive in a world in which the lack of faith in the media is allowed to increase.Many of the most dangerous countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Burundi, were not represented at the media freedom event in London. Abuses such as the murder of the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi helped make 2018 the worst year on record for violence and abuse against journalists, according to Reporters without Borders.Some will argue that lobbing things or calling reporters names in a UK street is nothing to do with the sort of appalling violence and abuse Hall was referring to. But the decrease in trust in the media in the UK, the US and elsewhere in the west has engendered an atmosphere in which violence is increasing.Citing a George Orwell quote etched into the walls of BBC headquarters, Hall said: “We’re now in the midst of the biggest assault on truth – and therefore democracy – since the 1930s.” A decade which saw the rise of propaganda as well as fascism and in which “bad actors and repressive regimes” have “weaponised misinformation” has found echoes almost 100 years later, with political extremes on all sides blaming the messenger.Meanwhile, Robinson, the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL)whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, wore a T-shirt for his sentencing which claimed that he had been “convicted for journalism”. Robinson was sent back to prison for breaching a reporting restriction, and encouraging “vigilante action”. Even junior journalists know not to break the laws of contempt as no one benefits from a mistrial.The Society of Editors condemned Robinson’s claims as a “dangerous distortion of the truth”.Misinformation, or lies for want of a better word, is of particular danger to journalism. Lies also lead to physical rage. During the recent elections in India, the BBC saw an increase in viewers when it published reports calling out fake news stories it also identified at least 25 lynch mob deaths after fake rumours spread on social media.But nothing should diminish the horror of physical attacks and even murder, which is increasing around the world. The Foreign Office deserves credit for hosting last week’s conference and announcing a series of pledges to do more, but more concrete action would not go amiss. Co-host Canada has managed to impose sanctions on Saudi nationals allegedly linked to the murder of Khashoggi. Why won’t the UK?Rebecca Vincent, UK director of RSF, pointed out that although Khashoggi was mentioned several times, there was no move to do anything about the 30 journalists campaign groups say are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia.We live in difficult, dangerous times in which a president can call the media the “enemy of the people” and a protester in London can shout “hang the judge”. We all know how the 1930s ended. As he heard his sentence last week, Robinson flashed a V for victory sign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2158d0b6faa35370784d3d42808438c4b1bad566/0_112_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a64b00446609f03715813f8d75f82f1","title":"how can i tend my allotment without visiting every day","story":"I started to rent an allotment with great intentions, but it is now hopelessly overgrownEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.I started to rent an allotment with great intentions last year.

He was raised in Caracas and Los Angeles, and studied at the San Francisco Art Institute, before dropping out to pursue music. To date he has released nine albums, beginning with The Charles C Leary in 2002. His music combines a wide range of influences including psych-folk and Tropicália – he has cited Vashti Bunyan, Caetano Veloso and Arthur Russell as musical heroes.

It helps me realise that the things that I’m concerned about are pretty much insignificant. And if you click on the app, you get a quote from a famous physicist or novelist or Zen master.This album came out a couple of months ago and it’s a masterpiece. It feels like the most refined version of everything Cate Le Bon has done to date – she’s becoming more and more comfortable with her tools and her practice. It’s as if you’re at a furniture convention and everybody is displaying chairs with rusty nails sticking out of them, and Cate has made a beautiful chair with cushions on it. It’s incredibly sophisticated, so full of references to different types of music and different moments in musical history that you can get an entire musical education just from listening to it. I particularly love a song called The Light.This gallery in Arlington Heights was co-founded in 2012 by a dear friend of mine, Noah Davis, a wonderful painter who died of cancer in 2015, aged 32. His wife, Karon,, also a fantastic artist, now continues it with the rest of the family. It was a storefront exhibition space that doubled as their home, and now it’s a legitimate gallery with incredible programming across art and music. It’s a real hub in a neighbourhood that’s not very happening, and it’s giving opportunities to emerging artists doing beautiful work.I picked this book up recently but it was written a long time ago.

This book, a mix of haikus and prose, recounts his travels through the far northern provinces of Japan, and because I live such an itinerant life, it’s a wonderful comfort to be reading it. He’s been a huge influence on me.Cory Allen is a meditation teacher, author and musician from Austin, Texas. On this podcast, he interviews some of my heroes, such as the Buddhist teacher Roshi Joan Halifax, the composer and sound designer Suzanne Ciani, and Dr Robert Thurman, who truly is my hero – he’s one of the leading Tibetologists on the planet. (Allen also did an episode with me, but that’s the stain on his otherwise pristine record.) The podcast is a really fascinating perspective on consciousness, mindfulness and spirituality, as well as music, and Allen is a really good interviewer.Anne Imhof is a powerful artist from Germany making work that is totally interdisciplinary. My number-one hero in terms of interdisciplinary art is Laurie Anderson, but I’ve always admired anyone who can think way beyond any one medium.

As the Saturn V rocket towered over the launchpad, about to send the first men to the moon, two dozen black families from poor parts of the south, accompanied by mules and wagons emblematic of the civil rights movement, marched to the fence of Cape Kennedy in Florida. From a bird’s eye view, they would have resembled dwarves in the wake of a colossus.They were led by Ralph Abernathy, successor to the slain Martin Luther King as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He carried a sign that said bluntly: “$12 a day to feed an astronaut. We could feed a starving child for $8.” He told a rally at the site: “We may go on from this day to Mars and to Jupiter and even to the heavens beyond, but as long as racism, poverty and hunger and war prevail on the Earth, we as a civilised nation have failed.”The Apollo 11 mission has been hailed as humankind’s greatest technological achievement and, after the turmoil of the 1960s, a redemptive moment of national and international unity. Speaking to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface in what he described as “the most historic telephone call ever made”, President Richard Nixon declared: “For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one.”Yet it was myth making then and will be again as America commemorates this month’s 50th anniversary with events, exhibitions and TV specials. The Apollo programme, motivated by the space race against the Soviet Union, cost $25.4bn, the equivalent of $180bn today only the Vietnam war hit taxpayers harder. While Nasa warned Congress “No bucks, no Buck Rogers”, polls showed a majority of Americans opposed the “moondoggle”.The black press questioned how the price tag could be justified when millions of African Americans were still mired in poverty. Testifying to the US Senate on race and urban poverty in 1966, King had observed “in a few years we can be assured that we will set a man on the moon and with an adequate telescope he will be able to see the slums on Earth with their intensified congestion, decay and turbulence”.The protest march on the eve of Apollo 11’s launch opened a new chapter in the poor people’s campaign, which had built a makeshift city at the National Mall in Washington a year earlier.Tom Paine, the administrator of Nasa, walked out to meet the demonstrators. An official Nasa history recalls: “Paine stood coatless under a cloudy sky, accompanied only by Nasa’s press officer, as Abernathy approached with his party, marching slowly and singing We Shall Overcome.“Several mules were in the lead, as symbols of rural poverty. Abernathy then gave a short speech. He deplored the condition of the nation’s poor, declaring that one-fifth of the nation lacked adequate food, clothing, shelter and medical care. In the face of such suffering, he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority. He urged that its funds be spent to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, tend the sick and house the homeless.“Paine replied that ‘if we could solve the problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button’. He added that Nasa’s technical advances were ‘child’s play’ compared to ‘the tremendously difficult human problems’ that concerned the SCLC. He offered the hope that Nasa indeed might contribute to addressing these problems, and then asked Abernathy, a minister, to pray for the safety of the astronauts. Abernathy answered with emotion that he would certainly do this, and they ended this impromptu meeting by shaking hands all around.”Among the protesters at Cape Kennedy (now know as Cape Canaveral) that day was JT Johnson, a civil rights activist who had been with King in Memphis shortly before he died and became a close aide to Abernathy. “They didn’t want you too close to where it was launching, so we just picked us a spot and decided to have us a rally and started talking and singing – the songs brought us through these difficult times – and we just did what we do,” Johnson recalled in an interview at his home in a suburb of Atlanta.“At that time, the whole movement was around poverty and poor people so that’s all we talked about: how poor we are and how is this thing going to the moon and spending millions when we don’t have any and some people don’t have a place to live or food to eat, but we still allow all of these things to happen. That was the real protest: billions for the moon and pennies for the poor.”Johnson is now an 81-year-old grandfather. He’s still politically active and hopes to tell more about the story of the civil rights movement. Wearing a blue T-shirt in his red dining room, he recalled growing up during the era of Jim Crow segregation in Montezuma, Georgia.“It had a big water fountain downtown with a ‘colored’ sign and a ‘white’ sign when all the water was coming from the same place,” he said. “As a child I couldn’t understand because most of these things didn’t seem fair to me. So the Lord knew that I was going to be in the movement before I did, because I didn’t know it and some of the things I just didn’t like. It wasn’t fair.”As for so many, King became his lodestar. “When I met Dr King, I thought that was the man I’d been waiting to see for all of my life and I dedicated myself to the civil rights movement.”In one protest in the 1960s, Johnson and others jumped into a whites-only swimming pool in St Augustine, Florida, only for the hotel owner to pour acid into the pool. After trying to integrate another swimming pool in Albany, Georgia, he was imprisoned for six days and went on hunger strike. In this context, President John F Kennedy’s dream of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade seemed a luxury that America could not afford.“I think it was all about PR really for the United States and Russia,” he said. “I think this country has never really taken care of people here … African Americans never got their share they spread it around everybody else.”Indeed, the Apollo programme gave every impression of being a project of white America. As footage of the era is replayed to mark the semicentennial, it is striking that all 12 people who walked on the moon were white men, and so too the overwhelming majority of officials, engineers and scientists at mission control. The musician and poet Gil Scott-Heron’s Whitey on the Moon summed up: “A rat done bit my sister Nell  With Whitey on the moon  Her face and arms began to swell  And Whitey’s on the moon.”Johnson said: “We didn’t hear an invitation we didn’t get anything. So we thought that was a disgrace and a disrespect to all of us … It was white people that was privileged in this country and they’d made it like that for themselves.”Johnson did not linger at Cape Kennedy to witness the epic Saturn V rocket launch. But like spellbound millions around the world, he did watch on TV when Armstrong set foot on the lunar surface. He recalled: “I guess it was exciting to see that happen, to be very frank with you, but here again the next day we were going back to the same thing. How do we feed our hungry?”Others, however, felt differently. Abernathy did stay to watch the launch in person. A college professor and maths teacher, he was not opposed to Apollo per se, but rather “the nation’s distorted sense of national priorities”.His daughter, Donzaleigh, who was an 11-year-old girl at the time, said by phone: “He wanted to bring attention to the fact that we’re spending billions to send men to the moon yet we cannot feed hungry children in America. By doing this my father also brought the attention of members of Congress to the issue of hunger and poverty.“It ended up being a win-win situation all way around: my dad said he felt like a really proud American and that, for just a moment when that rocket launched into space, it wasn’t about hunger, it wasn’t about poverty, it was about an accomplishment of human beings to go forth. And that’s miraculous within itself.”Donzaleigh, an actor who appeared alongside Meghan, Duchess of Sussex in the drama Suits, shares her father’s ultimately positive view of space exploration. “I don’t believe that it would be right or fair to say no … I think that would be counterproductive to the greater good of humanity.“However, you cannot do that singularly and not look back at those who are in front of your face every single day who are starving, who are wallowing in poverty.”Donzaleigh recalled that Abernathy had a vivid impact on the Nasa scientists, inspiring them to use technology to tackle pressing domestic needs such as air and water pollution. “Scientists do have an ability to impact our world in a positive way and they did that and I’m just so glad that the scientists listened,” she said.According to Neil Maher, an associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University, although Nasa never stated publicly that Abernathy’s protest pressured it to address the poverty of African Americans, it began taking steps to address those problems soon after.“In 1972 the space agency created an Urban Systems Project Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, which retooled technologies deployed for Apollo for use instead in America’s inner cities,” Maher, author of Apollo in the Age of Aquarius, said via email. “Such ‘spin-offs’ included water filtration systems, air pollution monitoring technologies, and even energy efficient heating and cooling systems from the Apollo space capsule for use instead in low-income housing projects.“While such efforts had the best of intentions, many of these technologies unfortunately failed to dramatically improve the daily life of African Americans living in America’s cities.”After Armstrong’s giant leap for mankind, the novelty quickly wore off, public interest in moon landings waned and doubts over the expense of it all only intensified. Nixon cut the Apollo programme short and rejected a proposal to build a moon base. In the years since, the Nasa workforce, including astronauts, has ersified significantly, and America elected its first black president. But the nation that put a man on the moon has still not solved racism, inequality or poverty.For Johnson, who was at the SCLC for 17 years and went on to set up a political consultancy, there is a sense of disappointment and wasted opportunities. He avoids driving in downtown Atlanta where people sleep rough under bridges: “That hurts my heart.” He, for one, will not be celebrating the golden anniversary of that transcendent moment on Earth’s nearest neighbour.“This country is still the same, people are still poor and they’re still hungry and that has not been corrected,” he said. “So here we are still playing the same game and no one is really protesting out there.“What I want to see is the end of poverty, people not hungry, people have a home and can enjoy life, and we put our money into science so we can get rid of Alzheimer’s, MS and all these different things that cripple us. We can live very happily in our own clothes and, as my grandma said, our own mind, until we die. That’s the way I’d like to see this Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10541d22facbcaadfefece21f39b888f9d9d88e2/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d63ecf7871a3ea01e5897b1ea2c07c6","title":"how has the menopause affected you share you experiences","story":"We’d like to find out what sort of support you have had at work or home and what if anything has helped symptoms? The menopause – when a woman’s fertile period comes to an end – can be a traumatic time for many women. The drop in hormone levels can introduce both physical and mental symptoms that can have a significant impact on quality of life. Some women find symptoms so overwhelming that they even think about quitting their jobs.The writer, Rose George has shared her own experiences of the menopause in a  article where she also raised the question why so little is known about it: “I woke up fatigued, stinking and angry that something so common, something that affects millions of women, is still such a medical mystery. Why do we get hot flushes? We don’t know. Why is sleep broken? We don’t know. Why are we the only creatures to get menopause apart from two types of whales? We don’t know.”Not everyone experiences problems with the menopause and many say that it can be a liberating time for women.The menopause affects women in myriad ways and we’d like to find out about your experiences. How has it affected you and what steps, if any, have you taken to tackle symptoms? Do you feel that your concerns or problems have been taken seriously by a medical professional? We’re interested in hearing about what treatments and therapies you have chosen and about what did and didn’t help.

Here, he talks about his recovery from a problem that plagues the restaurant industryI first talked to Craig Strippel back in the spring on the day before he was due to run in the London Marathon. Anyone who signs up for those 26 miles has a kind of reckless determination, but for Strippel, who had worked as a head chef in Cornish hotels and restaurants for much of his career, the challenge had become a very singular mission. That mission had begun just seven months earlier when, aged 37, Strippel had been within one small step of taking his own life.Sitting in a cafe in London, he could recall that evening in September 2018 both as if it were yesterday and as part of another existence entirely. At the time he was working on his own in the kitchen at a hotel restaurant near Penzance. It had been a long hot summer and Strippel had, for as long as he could remember, been in the habit of trying to drown all the tiredness and stress of the kitchen in alcohol.“Working on your own in the summer in a kitchen is bloody hard,” he said. “There was just a kitchen porter and me. Most days I’d have a whole long row of tickets for orders. The kitchen was open 11am until 8.30pm. I could handle it all, but only if I never talked to anyone while I worked. I had a massive charcoal grill, two fryers, a fish fryer, two big hobs, a grill and an oven and I would be working the whole lot myself. I was getting £10.65 an hour.” When the kitchen eventually closed he would do his cleaning and get the ordering done and would be finished at 10.30pm. His mates were behind the bar and in front of it. It was always: are you having a drink tonight, Craig? Of course he was.The truth was that he’d have been drinking most of the day already. When he got in, a colleague would offer him a beer and he would probably have had three or four pints before the lunch rush began. He’d ask for a pint of wine for the cooking, but he only needed a splash of it for his crab linguine so he would drink the rest. People would tip him with drinks, so by the end of the week there would be eight or nine pints waiting. He only used drugs when he was drinking, he says. He’d take something to sober himself up enough so he could drink some more. Sometimes he lost two or three days in this way – he could spend £500 in a weekend, no problem – but mostly he just kept going to work he had a partner and three young kids at home.As with all addiction, Strippel thought for a long time that he could cope with it, then he knew for a terrifying fact that he could not. “The last summer it just got worse and worse,” he said. “I got to the point in September when I honestly could not see a way out. I went out drinking with my mates and I was saying to them, ‘Big party tonight because it is the last night I will drink.’”Strippel left his mates in the early hours and walked to a place along the coast. “I stood there and I wanted to jump but my legs wouldn’t do it,” he said. And then there was a kind of It’s a Wonderful Life moment. “A guy who was out fishing spotted me and shone a torchlight on me from his boat,” Strippel recalled. “He just kept the light on me, and I felt I couldn’t move.” The fisherman called the lifeguard and soon there was a helicopter, a lifeboat and police negotiators. After an hour and a half Strippel was talked down with the promise of a cigarette. Some of these statistics have been fuelled by a working culture which, through the 1990s and 2000s fetishised extreme pressure and made the kitchen seem like a war zone. The suicide of Anthony Bourdain last year, the chef who did so much to create that high-adrenaline charge around cooking, provoked a lot of soul-searching. Bourdain had conquered a heroin and crack-cocaine addiction he had never given up on a love of booze: “You see me drink myself stupid on my show all the time … When I indulge, I indulge.” There has since been a series of confessionals from high-profile chefs, who have acknowledged the potential self-destructiveness of that mythology. David MacMillan of Joe Beef – who Bourdain called “the rogue prince of hospitality” – had made his restaurant a byword for excess of all kinds. “The community of people I surrounded myself with ate and drank like Vikings,” he said. “It worked well in my 20s. It worked well in my 30s. It started to unravel when I was 40. I couldn’t shut it off.” Now, after a period in rehab, he has become an evangelist for greater duty of care in the heat of the kitchen.Tom Kerridge, of the Hand and Flowers, has been frank about a similar personal reckoning. “Alcohol had gained a grip,” he said on Desert Island Discs. “I was drinking colossal amounts. I would always be the last man standing, driving it on. At the end of service I would order a pint of negroni, just as a starter … I have completely destroyed alcohol for myself. I’m untrustworthy with it.”One result has been a generational shift, even among alpha-males who run kitchens. When Gordon Ramsay, another prime mover in that previous culture, made a heartfelt documentary in 2017 about the destructiveness of the cocaine trade – after a young chef he had worked with fell to his death after taking the drug – he talked about efforts to outlaw the “food industry’s dirty little secret”. Neil Rankin of the pit-barbecue pioneer Temper suggested bluntly in a Facebook post that Ramsay’s fondness for long-hours culture hadn’t helped: “Oh fuck off Gordon. Try doing something positive rather than glorifying kitchen abuse, telling chefs today they have to work the stupid hours that you did (and probably hated) and now saying everyone’s on drugs. Things are looking up for chefs. We’re trying to treat them like adults, partners and employees for the first time in decades and give them a future beyond burning out at 30.” Ramsay recently acknowledged the changing roles: “There’s a responsibility we all have to ensure that there are areas of support for when people stumble and struggle – and that includes in the workplace … and that includes me.”The statistics – and stories like Strippel’s – suggest that across the industry there is still plenty of work to do. Like many chefs, Strippel drifted into the kitchen. He had a live-in job as a commis chef at 16. One of his early jobs was as a kind of troubleshooter, pitching up in failing kitchens in his whites, checking out the fridges, raising standards before moving on. The real sleep deprivation – and the compensatory drinking – kicked in when he worked as a senior chef, starting at half five in the morning and finishing at half past one five days a week.“There are probably side effects with every job,” he says. “But with chefs it was usually drugs and alcohol. I would have the weekend off and I was living in Warminster, near the barracks, so there were always squaddies around. I made a lot of friends who weren’t friends.”When he moved to Cornwall he worked for a while with Rick Stein in Padstow – “probably the most laid back of anyone I worked for” – and then jobbing around various hotels. I wonder if he was infected by that Bourdain “life on the edge” mythology.He says he recognised it, but it wasn’t the main reason. “The money was really good to start with,” he says. He was getting £32,000 a year at that senior chef job and only a few hours of free time to spend any of it.The day after the suicide attempt Strippel called Addaction, a charity that helps addicts one-to-one. He went to his first AA meeting. And he called into work to explain why he wasn’t coming in that day, or any day. Though he had sometimes gone awol over the years, no employer had once asked if he needed help.Strippel was never a runner before he stopped drinking. But not long after his crisis his eldest son asked if he would join him in a charity 10k. He ran it in an hour and it almost killed him, but he was hooked and started running the coast paths every day. “I have got that care inside of me, I care about myself again.”When I spoke to him before the marathon he suggested that he couldn’t ever work in a kitchen again, but three months later he had changed his mind about that and felt strong enough to take a job at Mackerel Sky, the noted fish restaurant in Newlyn. He was going to work as a kitchen porter to begin with, just to see how it felt. “I need to work,” he said, “and this is Cornwall so there aren’t that many options. It’s all I can do.” He was hopeful it would be fine. “It’s a minute’s walk away and my shifts end at 8.30pm.” He would be sure to head straight home, he said, because he liked to get up early these days for a run.He had other marathons in mind, New York, Paris, Boston, now he knew what was involved. Before London he had never run more than 16 miles. On the day itself it was at about that point that his legs went, he told me, but a girl running alongside him insisted: “Your brain is telling you that you are done, but your legs don’t have to believe it.” Strippel had heard that particular voice in his head once before. The final 365 yards down the Mall were the longest he has ever contemplated, but there was not only an end in sight, but also a new beginning.In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

Padraig Harrington bears testament to that, even if an inquisitive nature took over eventually. As border checks and bombs reflected a grim way of life, Harrington was – in theory anyway – flirting with danger when travelling north from Dublin to participate in amateur championships. A journey that started as a teenager in 1987 will have travelled full circle by the time Harrington arrives at Royal Portrush for the 148th Open Championship that starts on Thursday.“There were four of us driving up to Warrenpoint to play a match and we were stopped on the road, there was a big tailback, an hour of traffic before we get to a soldier redirecting us on to a detour,” Harrington says. “The driver was told: ‘Ah, there is just a wee problem up the road.’ On the news later there was a 500lb bomb on the road.“It’s amazing how when you get older, the books you read, you find out how the people who lived through that just became normalised by it. A 500lb bomb was a big deal to us but run‑of-the-mill or a ‘wee problem’.”Any sense that Harrington was scarred or jaundiced by such episodes would be wrong. When the two‑times Open champion arrives in Portrush for the final major of the year, there will be only fond memories. Harrington received respect and admiration in Northern Ireland as his golf blossomed. The feelings were quickly mutual.“People coming up from the south had, how would I put it, a view of Northern Ireland and that was certainly not what I experienced,” he says. “I don’t think people could have been nicer.“In my situation playing golf, you just didn’t see or know or be aware of anything beyond how nice people were. There was definitely an appreciation that you had come to play up there at the time some people wouldn’t go. I just always remember how welcoming and nice they were.“There would be a view coming from the south that you would be treated differently and maybe I was but I was treated differently in the very best possible way.“Even if we went to the wrong place, drove down the wrong road, people would be nice to you and help you get to the right place, get out of that place. They were nice to outsiders.“I’d think: ‘Well I’m here to play championship golf, this is what I do’, but you then begin to see a bigger picture. At the start of the 90s there was normality on the surface when there certainly wasn’t underneath but I didn’t see that at all. I think tourists maybe felt the same way, they couldn’t believe how welcoming people were. There was more of an appreciation there. So eventually you say: ‘OK, why is that?’”In the here and now Harrington expresses hope that a hard border will not be reintroduced as a result of Brexit. “It stops the ability of goods and people to flow, which normalises that we are all Europeans.”Perhaps Harrington’s current role, as Europe’s Ryder Cup captain, heightens his sensitivities in that regard. The 47-year-old’s recollections of checkpoint controls include the stark reality that epitomises what sportspeople – and there were so many of them – encountered as Ireland was defined by ision.“You’d pull up to the main border crossing and they seemed to put the youngest member of the regiment on guard, so you had a guy not much older than you or even younger than you. He looked 16 or 17 when he must be 18 or 19,” says Harrington. “He would lean into the driver to ask for details and his gun would be 45 degrees across his chest and down, which basically means it is pointing at you in the back seat. You are sitting there thinking: ‘Please let nothing happen to scare this lad ...’ You don’t want a car to backfire or anything because this gun is pointing at you and it’s loaded. He is a kid, I’m a kid. It’s an odd feeling.“Coming from the Republic, the police don’t carry guns, we don’t see guns. Still to this day I find it very odd when I travel the world and see a policeman with a gun. I stare at the gun. Policemen must genuinely worry about me because I can’t help myself staring at their gun. It was just so weird back in those days because we didn’t see guns.”Harrington has a deep affinity with Royal Portrush Golf Club, where he held the course record until “some young kid tore it apart” – a reference to Rory McIlroy.The significance of this Open, returning the tournament to the Antrim coast for the first time since 1951 will not be understated by the champion of 2007 and 2008. “It’s huge for the Open to go back and it’s a great course,” he says.“It’s great for the town of Portrush to have this festival. It’s great for Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that we have moved on so much, we can host an event like this.There are few better ambassadors for this championship than Harrington, a role he treats seriously. As the game wrestles for prominence in a cluttered sporting world, he believes this Open departure from mainland Britain could be a necessary indicator of things to come.“The R\u0026ampA represents 70 million golfers, the PGA Tour represents a couple of thousand players,” Harrington says. “The R\u0026ampA host the Open and this is the start in time it will move around. I cannot see why they won’t continue to move it, not just to countries in Great Britain but to countries all around the world. Who knows where it will be held in 100 years’ time? It could be Australia.“There is plenty of jurisdiction for the Open. For the R\u0026ampA, it is putting it out there that they are a true championship.“Portrush won’t just be a successful Open but it is a great move by the R\u0026ampA to point out how much they are the major of the people. I believe the amateur game is far bigger than the pro game. Unfortunately the amateur game has to pander to the pro game.”This week golf’s big names are the ones in the spotlight. So, too, is a more serene Northern Ireland. Harrington would be forgiven a smile during quiet reflection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52b82272f07f82976773c8b53ccd3d78383bdc83/0_224_4700_2819/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a75fdca6bd927e0f90a4b5c5e219a4","title":"f1 british grand prix live","story":"Lap 15 of 52: Leclerc overtakes almost instantly once they get out of the pits, after Verstappen drifted way wide – he gets on the radio to tell his mechanics that he had no grip.Lap 14 of 52: Leclerc and Verstappen both come into the pits!

No celebration from Woakes, who is still annoyed that the previous delivery turned past Buttler for four wides. That was an important innings from Latham, who scored 47 from 56 balls.48th over: New Zealand 225-6 (Latham 47, Santner 2) This feels like a competitive score for New Zealand on a slightly sluggish pitch, though it’s contingent on Trent Boult and Matt Henry taking wickets with the new ball. Those first 10 overs of the England innings could redefine squeaky-bum time.New Zealand are struggling to hit boundaries – just one since the 39th over – but they have been good at picking up singles off most deliveries. They take five more from Archer’s ninth over. New Zealand are on course for a New Zealand total. 47th over: New Zealand 220-6 (Latham 44, Santner 0) Vince is on the field because Mark Wood went off with what looks like a side strain. Colin de Grandhomme is put of his misery by Chris Woakes. It was a slower ball that took a leading edge and spooned to the substitute James Vince at mid-off. de Grandhomme, such a dangerous hitter, goes for a miserable 28-ball 16.46th over: New Zealand 214-5 (Latham 41, de Grandhomme 13) Latham found a bit of form against England at Chester-le-Street, even though the game had long gone, and he has taken that into today. de Grandhomme, meanwhile, is pinned for the umpteenth time by Archer. He is struggling to get bat on ball, never mind middle it, and Archer finishes the over with three consecutive dot balls. de Grandhomme has 13 from 25 balls. He might well be the difference between a target of 225 and 255 - but not in the way we expected.“I haven’t picked up a bat in four years and foolishly agreed to play in a one-off, get-the-band-back-together match in deepest, darkest Kent (at an admittedly very picturesque ground),” says OIiver Smiddy. “So instead of watching the cricket I’m padded up, waiting to go in and scratch around horribly for a few overs before holing out to cover. Sad.”45th over: New Zealand 211-5 (Latham 39, de Grandhomme 12) Latham misses a lusty swipe across the line at Wood - but he nails the next ball into the crowd at cow corner. That was a beautiful stroke, an almost nonchalant pick up for six. de Grandhomme then survives a run-out referral after a smart bit of work from Buttler. Wood finishes with 10-1-49-1. This is getting exquisitely tense, although don’t quote on me on the exquisite part. “Very much enjoyed Mr. de Lisle’s terrific, heart-touching piece on attending the 1975 final,” says Mac Millings. “My first time attending an international cricket match was the ‘83 final. I was 11, and probably still have my scorecard tucked away somewhere. Chief memories: a West Indian fan behind me and my family, yelling, ‘Vivian Richards! Show ‘em you are the Master Blaster!’ every couple of minutes, until circumstances - and Madan Lal - dictated that he had to stop and my mother (no aficionada) asking why both teams were wearing the same colour, and where the commentary was.”44th over: New Zealand 204-5 (Latham 32, de Grandhomme 12) de Grandhomme has become a bit of a punchbag for the England bowlers. He is hit on the back twice by slower bouncers from Archer, and inbetween he mistimes a cut stroke just short of Stokes in the covers. But there are also three wides in Archer’s over, which takes New Zealand past 200. Although it feels like England have controlled the game since the 20th over, New Zealand are inching towards a really handy score. We’ve said it a few times at this tournament - almost every game - but the first 10 overs of the England innings will probably decide this match. 43rd over: New Zealand 196-5 (Latham 29, de Grandhomme 12) A bouncer from Wood hits de Grandhomme on the back and flies away for four leg byes. Although de Grandhomme has started scratchily, he’s such a dangerous hitter that England will take nothing for granted. He could be the difference between a target of 225 and 255. “I am spending the afternoon on duty at Cape Cornwall Coastwatch hut, on the edge of the cliff overlooking the Atlantic,” writes Constance Moore. “Can’t listen to TMS because I need to hear calls on the radio from shipping or coastguard, so will be depending on your updates when I have a moment to spare! Most glorious view in the world does make up for it...”42nd over: New Zealand 186-5 (Latham 27, de Grandhomme 8) de Grandhomme is fine to continue. Five from Archer’s over - four singles and a wide.41.3 overs: New Zealand 183-5 (Latham 26, de Grandhomme 7) Jofra Archer returns to the attack and hits de Grandhomme on the helmet with a fine bouncer. In fact, de Grandhomme top-edged an attempted hook onto his helmet, from where it looped just past backward point. There will be a break in play while de Grandhomme receives treatment.“I am on a quest to become the first(?) family to appear on OBO during a tournament,” says Anand. “Is it a thing? Perhaps an OBO honours board? My son, Advaith, who has just turned 7 has been introduced to cricket during this tournament. A proud moment as a father happened when he decided that he would rather play yard cricket with me that go out to eat at his favourite restaurant. When he isn’t supporting his favourite team, India, he wants to save his favourite planet.” Hello Advaith! Also, would you like to be our prime minister?41st over: New Zealand 181-5 (Latham 25, de Grandhomme 6) We’re into the last ten overs. A run a ball would take New Zealand to 239, and they know how to defend that. Plunkett, bowling his final over, slips a fine delivery past de Grandhomme’s outside edge. He ends a superb spell with figures of 10-0-42-3.“Hey Rob,” says Ronan. “There’s a fair few of us in Cologne watching the game in Barney Vallely’s Irish pub in the Old Town. Should be a good atmosphere when we come into bat. You can let David Horn know.” 40th over: New Zealand 179-5 (Latham 24, de Grandhomme 5) “Bit closer to home, I’m sat in a pub In Uphall, nr Edinburgh,” says Marc Greenhalgh. “Three screens showing three different sports: golf to the left of me, horse racing and F1 to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you. It’s like the World Cup final isn’t even happening.”In philosophical terms, I don’t think it is.39th over: New Zealand 173-5 (Latham 23, de Grandhomme 0) If you have a problem in the middle overs, if no one else can help, and if you can find him, maybe you can hire Liam Plunkett. That was an Andrex-soft dismissal from Neesham, who had been playing so well. He tried to drive Plunkett over mid-on but clodhopped it straight to Root. It might have been a slower ball, I’m not quite sure. Either way, Plunkett has three wickets.Plunkett has done it again!38th over: New Zealand 165-4 (Latham 22, Neesham 12) Neesham’s timing must be infectious. Latham has started to find the sweet spot, too, and he push-drives Wood beautifully through extra cover for four. New Zealand are moving doggedly towards a workable score.“My daughter Daisy has decided enough is enough,” says Dave Childs, “and we are now watching Sooty instead of the most important cricket game in 14 years.”Did you put ideas in her head by saying the New Zealand batsmen should use the sweep against Rashid?37th over: New Zealand 159-4 (Latham 17, Neesham 11) Liam Plunkett replaces Ben Stokes. It was going to be Archer, but then he or Morgan changed their mind. Plunkett drops short to Latham, who picks him up sweetly towards long leg for a one-bounce for.“Hi Rob, this is stupid,” says David Horn, cutting urgently to the chase. “I’ve decided to ditch the family for a day of our vacation and am now wandering around a foreign city that is mostly closed, looking for The Cricket. Any of your readers know Cologne better than me and can help me out?”36th over: New Zealand 153-4 (Latham 12, Neesham 10) Neesham has timed the ball gloriously since coming to the crease, much better than anyone else today. He pings a drive off Wood that is stopped by Morgan at extra cover and then nails a pull that is superbly stopped by the ing Woakes on the midwicket boundary. That saved three runs, and the run that Neesham did get is the only one from the over. Wood, like Plunkett, has bowled a much better second spell after switching ends.“Gary Naylor is right to acknowledge Sky’s investment but why is this topic still being discussed in binary all-or-nothing terms?” writes our own Ali Martin. “Most people surely accept the sport won’t return to terrestrial TV full time ... but that doesn’t mean a better balance can’t still be struck between revenue and reach. Even the ECB now acknowledge the need for this, if the next rights deal is anything to go by (collective revulsiontrepidation about The Hundred notwithstanding).” 35th over: New Zealand 152-4 (Latham 12, Neesham 9) Neesham gets off the mark with a superb shot, flicking Stokes wristily through midwicket for four. Even the deranged boundary-riding beast Bairstow couldn’t stop it. That’s the first boundary since the 20th over - and he pulls another through mid-on two balls later. That’s excellent, testicular batting from one of the more impressive characters at this World Cup.Thanks for all your emails, which I’m trying to read between ballsoverspangs of the purest fear. “Hello Rob!” says Georgina Stickels. “This Aussie is joining you from southern Senegal. They’re all football mad here (and Senegal is playing in the Afcon final later, so no wonder!) so no telly for me. SO pleased you chaps are online. Am gunning for NZ obviously: hoping they can regroup. Kia kaha, Aotearoa!”34th over: New Zealand 141-4 (Latham 11, Neesham 0) Taylor and New Zealand were hard done by: replays show the ball from Wood was just bouncing over the stumps. THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDN’T PLAY SILLY BUGGERS WITH YOUR TEAM’S REVIEW, PART 4369123423523425310.Wood, meanwhile, completes a wicket maiden by zipping one past Jimmy Neesham’s outside edge.“Indifference to the World Cup?” sniffs Alasdair Brooks. “Forget Berlin forget the mountains of northern Vietnam. Try an archaeology museum on the outskirts of Cairo the indifference here is so total that my lovely Egyptian colleagues are indifferent to the possibility that there might be something towards which they might target their indifference.”That looked slightly high, but Marais Erasmus gave it out. Taylor pushed around a sharp delivery from Wood that came back to hit him on the pad. The line was fine we haven’t seen a replay that shows whether it was bouncing over the stumps. I suspect it was, just.Mark Wood strikes with the first ball of a new spell - and New Zealand can’t review it!33rd over: New Zealand 141-3 (Taylor 15, Latham 11) An outside edge from Latham flies safely to third man for a single. Both sides are jockeying for position ahead of the death overs, and despite losing Williamson I think New Zealand will be happy enough with their position.32nd over: New Zealand 134-3 (Taylor 13, Latham 9) More low-risk milking of Rashid four from the over. New Zealand have played Rashid pretty well, because although he has only conceded one boundary, he is still going at five an over. “Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar,” says Emiel de Bont. “A friend whom I have been trying to take an interest in cricket, texts me to ask if Test matches are like qualifiers for the World Cup. Where to begin...”31st over: New Zealand 130-3 (Taylor 11, Latham 7) Stokes replaces Plunkett, who has three overs up his sleeve. Latham is beaten, trying to cut a ball that trampolines from a length. New Zealand haven’t hit a boundary since the 20th over, although they do manage four singles off Stokes. Time for drinks.“Rob,” says Mac Millings. “I have The Fear, Rob, expressed here in my all-time Fear XI:“OBO by Timorous de Lisle”30th over: New Zealand 126-3 (Taylor 9, Latham 5) A lucky escape for Taylor. He charged Rashid, got nowhere near the pitch but managed to get a bottom-edge that bounced over the keeper Buttler. Had it not done so, Buttler would have had a simple stumping chance. “Afternoon Rob!” says Rob Wolf Petersen. “I hope you’re in fine fettle. This is only going to go one way, isn’t it? New Zealand 261-7, England 113 all out. During the presentation, Williamson will explain that the team’s analyses deduced that a score in the region of 260 wins 70 percent of matches. Then he’ll pull off his rubber face mask to reveal the cackling, maniacal visage of Peter Moores.”29th over: New Zealand 123-3 (Taylor 8, Latham 3) Latham almost joins Nicholls in dragging Latham back onto the stumps. Thankfully for him it hit the pad and landed safely. But it’s another good over from Plunkett, with just a single from the last ball. Since he switched to the Nursery End, Plunkett has figures of 4-0-7-2. Pick those out!“The emailers you have lauding the return of live cricket to free-to-air channels understand that those same channels do not want live cricket, will not invest the time and money to present the game properly in all formats around the world and are shamelessly cherry picking one of the few matches they do want today?” says Gary Naylor. “Anyone who grew up in the 70s and 80s should thank Sky for what they do for the cricket fan. And as for kids being inspired by blanket free-to-air coverage, how’s that working out with the tennis these last few decades?”28th over: New Zealand 122-3 (Taylor 8, Latham 2) Four singles from Rashid’s sixth over. It’s so hard to know what a good score is, because the pressure of a World Cup final runchase could scramble the Win Predictor, never mind the brains of the batsmen. I suspect New Zealand would be very happy with anything above 250.“Afternoon Rob, afternoon everybody,” says John Withington. “I’m wondering if anybody out there has the data to confirm my suspicion that reviewing every decisions by umpire Dharmasena is statistically as sound a strategy as any other.”He has looked out of form at this tournament, hasn’t he? Mind you, the performances of Marais Erasmus suggest that, for some umpires, form is permanent.27th over: New Zealand 118-3 (Taylor 6, Latham 0) Nicholls played an excellent innings and will feel a bit unfortunate, as that ball could easily have gone away for four. “You think no-one cares in Berlin?” sniffs Kevin Rodgers. “I’m in the mountains of northern Vietnam getting OBO with a dodgiest Wi-fi imaginable. Surrounding indifference is total regardless, nails are being destroyed.”Liam Plunkett has done it again! Nicholls tried to drive a fullish delivery that straightened just enough to take the inside edge and fly back onto the stumps. Plunkett’s second spell - two for six from 2.5 overs - has dragged England right back into the game.26th over: New Zealand 114-2 (Nicholls 52, Taylor 5) Nicholls drives Rashid down the ground for a single to reach a fine, purposeful half-century from 71 balls. Both batsmen are using their feet against Rashid, although at this stage they are only looking to drive him down the ground for a single.25th over: New Zealand 109-2 (Nicholls 49, Taylor 3) Taylor will take a few overs to get his eye in, knowing he can make up for lost time later in the innings. His one attacking stroke in that Plunkett over is a play-and-miss at a wide slower ball. Taylor is New Zealand’s second best batsman, with daylight either side, so England would love to pick him up early on. Plunkett is into his work now his figures in this spell at 2-0-2-1.“Morning Rob,” says James Lane, “or evening here in Australia. I wasn’t planning on watching this, but is it sneakily turning into the kind of game that, at 1am, you groan as you realise you just have to watch to the bitter end? Plus, if England go down, your patented brand of sadomasochism is exactly what’s required.”That’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said about me.24th over: New Zealand 108-2 (Nicholls 48, Taylor 3) Nicholls edges Rashid’s googly for a single. It was a safe shot, with no slip in place. Rashid (4-0-23-0) doesn’t look at his best, although I said that at the same stage of the semi-final, and then he took three lovely wickets.“It’s been a wild ride, sir,” says Abhijato Sensarma. “We seek catharsis we shall find it today. We seek a new name on the trophy we shall find it today. We seek redemption we shall find it today. Hearts have been broken and fairytales have come true along the way. A million emotions have been felt throughout this journey, but now that we’re at the end there’s nothing much left to say. Whoever wins the final will deserve to. And that, Mr Smyth, should be our greatest joy.”What did you have for breakfast? Professional curiosity. 23rd over: New Zealand 103-2 (Nicholls 46, Taylor 0) In this tournament, Liam Plunkett has dismissed, among others, Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson, Chris Gayle, Quinton de Kock and Old Father Time.  “Good morning Rob,” says Shannon Campbell. “I’m here in Berlin following the final and this German metropolis oozes indifference at my nervous excitement. Friends want to go for walks, in forests! Have they no idea?! No they don’t. Do they understand? No they don’t! Would they willingly smash up their BMW for a ticket to a German World Cup football qualifier against Niue, yes they would! The OBO is a refuge in this hedonistic land, an oasis of sanity where hopefully the Black Caps can prevail and we can, in future, get more than a two-Test series every 12 years against one of the big three.”I’m surprised there isn’t – at the very least – an ironic love of cricket. Berlin is losing its edge.With England in increasingly urgent need of a wicket, Morgan turned to his trusty middle-overs winkler. And he picked up the big wicket with his fourth ball. Williamson drove outside off stump at a cross-seam delivery and got the thinnest edge through to Buttler. Kumar Dharmasena gave it not out but England reviewed instantly, and Ultra-Edge backed them up. Kane Williamson is out!Liam Plunkett. Liam bloody Plunkett has done it again!England are certain this is out.22nd over: New Zealand 101-1 (Nicholls 45, Williamson 30) Nicholls is looking to join the list of unlikely World Cup final matchwinners, which includes Collis King, Gautam Gambhir, Mike Veletta, Madan Lal and Steve Bucknor. He steals a single off Rashid to bring up the hundred, one of four from the over. This has been such a calm, mature partnership. England need to make something happen, which is usually a job for Ben Stokes.21st over: New Zealand 97-1 (Nicholls 43, Williamson 28) Williamson drives Wood sweetly through extra cover, and Bairstow charges round the boundary as if world peace depends on him saving a solitary run. That’s precisely what he does with a typically zealous sprawl. New Zealand are controlling the game at the moment the last eight overs have yielded 51 runs.Thanks Tim, hello everyone. You thought it was going to be easy, didn’t you? Where have you been these last four decades? If England are going to win the World Cup, they will have to come from behind in the match for the first time at this tournament. New Zealand have moved stealthily into a good position, while England’s bowlers, Chris Woakes excepted, have been slightly flat. They need a wicket pretty soon, ideally Williamson.20th over: New Zealand 91-1 (Nicholls 40, Williamson 24) This is getting ominous for England supporters. Williamson lofts the first ball of Rashid’s second over for four, picking his spot beautifully, and then sweeps for the first time to pick up two more. That’s it from me for the moment: over to the ever-excellent Rob Smyth.19th over: New Zealand 84-1 (Nicholls 40, Williamson 17) After going for a cheap four as Nicholls glides to wide third man, Wood finds a good riposte with a bouncer that is fended uncertainly and a length ball that beats the outside edge. Wood is a much improved bowler. But NZ are still on top.18th over: New Zealand 77-1 (Nicholls 35, Williamson 15) Here is Adil Rashid, who bowled so well against Australia. Nicholls is looking to sweep him, Williamson to drive – first on the ground to long-off, where Joe Root saves a second, then in the air over midwicket. Impressive intent from both batsmen.A worrying tweet from Lord’s. “The atmosphere is a disaster,” says Richard Vale, “entirely because of the way tickets were allocated. Is anyone in the press going to comment on that?” Good observation, but it seems a little early to sniff a conspiracy of silence. 17th over: New Zealand 70-1 (Nicholls 33, Williamson 10) A better over from Wood, but Williamson dabs a single into the leg side to reach double figures off 32 balls.“Hello from wet West London,” says Anna Durrance-Bagale. “I was trying to explain the rules of cricket to my husband - he just kept asking ‘ yes but who’s winning?’ (on a par with ‘why are they wearing pyjamas?’). Big sigh - I give up.” Love it.16th over: New Zealand 68-1 (Nicholls 32, Williamson 9) Plunkett goes for another four, first ball, as Nicholls pulls one of those bang-it-in balls of his. More significantly, Stokes hurts himself trying to make a ing save on the square-leg boundary. Is that a strained calf or a touch of cramp? Plunkett shapes up for the rest of the over, but he has 3-0-19-0 and it’s surely time for Rashid or Stokes, assuming the calf’s OK.15th over: New Zealand 63-1 (Nicholls 27, Williamson 9) Woakes finally takes his sweater, with the very Woakesian figures of 7-0-19-1. Mark Wood comes on and promptly beats Williamson outside off with his extra pace, but the over is patchy – there’s a wide, a juicy full toss which Williamson can only push back to the bowler, and a bouncer that’s too easy to glove away for four. That’s drinks, and although England started strongly, NZ are now in the driving seat.14th over: New Zealand 55-1 (Nicholls 27, Williamson 4) A few singles off Plunkett, and then a four as Nicholls easily finds the gap with his tuck behind square. It’s great to have Plunkett here, this man whose first World Cup was in 2007 and who hasn’t been on the losing side yet in the World Cup of 2019, but I’m baffled as to why Morgan has him on now, when the ball is still moving for the pitch-it-up merchants.13th over: New Zealand 47-1 (Nicholls 21, Williamson 2) Morgan decides to give a seventh over to Woakes, who has a shout for LBW against Williamson – too high, but a fine delivery, jagging back up the hill. Williamson has two runs from 21 balls, but that won’t worry him, nor should it. The man who batted No.3 in the first innings of the first World Cup final at Lord’s, Rohan Kanhai of West Indies, was scoreless for 11 overs, and still finished on the winning side.An email from Mike Sansom. “Bombing along the road from General Santos to Cotabato in Mindanao Philippines,” says Mike Sansom, “although that is probably the wrong verb given recent conflicts and this is New People’s Army Country. Talking of New People’s Army, go Black Caps and Aotearoa.”12th over: New Zealand 46-1 (Nicholls 21, Williamson 2) A bowling change at last, and just when you’re expecting Mark Wood or Ben Stokes – or even Adil Rashid, as Williamson is mortal against leg spin – on comes Liam Plunkett. Is Morgan a little too keen to get funky? Or feeling suddenly wary? No slips, and Nicholls visibly relaxes, taking three twos.11th over: New Zealand 40-1 (Nicholls 15, Williamson 2) Three unusual things in this over: Woakes bowls a wide to Williamson, and a long hop to Nicholls, who cuts for four. And Williamson shows signs of impatience, cutting one that’s too close, and getting away with a single through the vacant third slip. Even after a poor over by his standards, Woakes has figures of 6-0-18-1. In the first Powerplay, there were 44 dots.“Watching the game live on TV,” says Matt Sowrey, “but it would be wrong to desert the always free-to-air OBO that has given me so much pleasure (and heartache) over the years.” Pleasure and heartache, that’s our secret sauce.10th over: New Zealand 33-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 1) Williamson is off the mark! With a dab to silly mid-on off Archer. And the Powerplay ends, with the power nicely balanced: England have bowled well and removed a man who can score 200 on his day, but NZ will be happy to have laid a foundation.“I suspect if Williamson gets out to Archer now,” says Emma John on Twitter, “this is going to be a terrible game. I can’t believe I’m actually rooting for him to stay in right now. What is happening to me?” 9th over: New Zealand 31-1 (Nicholls 10, Williamson 0) Now that Guptill has gone, Nicholls is getting twitchy. He plays and misses with a carve at a wideish one from Woakes, then takes a run that’s too tight and would be out if Roy had hit from mid-off. Only ten runs off the past five overs: this is every bit as absorbing as a World Cup final should be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fca00cb8555c78e2d5086ea0addfb6248c117a4/587_0_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82ff4e59b1c5f070e808b1a87e65c8b8","title":"jerry seinfeld review hammersmith apollo london","story":"Hammersmith Apollo, LondonNow in his mid-60s, the comedian is still delivering beautifully honed, brilliantly timed observations on everyday life‘I feel like a blacksmith up here sometimes,” says Jerry Seinfeld in a routine addressing 21st-century communication. Talking has been superseded it’s an outmoded thing to do. That may be true when it comes to phones – or true enough to make a joke out of – but there’s nothing unfashionable about talking a la Seinfeld, whose brand of observational comedy spawned a thousand imitators and remains standup’s dominant mode. Tonight, we see it executed with perfect mastery by a man whose performing powers seem undiminished at a hard-to-credit 65.Laughs flow freely throughout his 70 minutes on stage. Insights into the real Jerry, or new perspectives on the world – well, there are fewer of those, in a set whose proficiency feels a little facile, just a teensy bit soulless. Two-thirds in, he steps away from the gags to promise us a change of tack, a glimpse of where his life is in 2019. But what follows is more of the same common-touch comedy, in this case about marriage (he’s at 19 years and counting) and kids. Several of the “men do this, women do that” gags are retrieved from his back catalogue. His take on family life you could call timeless – or lacking in novelty.But, technically, the jokes are so neat – and the delivery, exemplary, This man can do comic timing like Paul McCartney does melody. The opening sequence is a belter, as Seinfeld anatomises the night-out experience. Why are we here? Why ishe? This is a “bogus, hyped-up, not necessary special event” designed to pass the time and make us feel our lives are great. But then – next gag – “‘sucks’ and ‘great’ are pretty close”, says Jerry, and isn’t everything a bit rubbish anyway?It’s a deft start, narrowing the gap between megastar and audience, then stretching it again as comedy requires. But there’s little in tonight’s show to suggest the rarefied life multimillionaire Seinfeld must lead. His modern-life-is-funny gags are hard-wired to be relatable, from the routine about all-you-can-eat buffets to the number addressing the cult of “hydration”. Each is drolly brought to life as our host role plays gluttonous overeaters or energy-drink junkies exhaustedly craving a fix.Perhaps because what Seinfeld is saying is often trivial, attention strays to how he’s saying it – with a sense of rhythm and cadence so finely tuned, it could be applied to almost anything and still make you laugh. You might doubt there’s more humour to be wrung from that hoary standup subject, mobile phones. But Jerry manages it, with a routine looking at the anthropology of Uber, and wondering (as he did about dog ownership many moons ago) whether nowadays the human owns the phone, or vice versa.As per his wonderfully withering gag about the vapid phrase “it is what it is”, the material zeroes in on how ridiculous we all are. But it also advertises senior citizen Seinfeld’s increasing detachment from the whole rigmarole. In the only section he couldn’t have delivered any earlier in his career, he celebrates life as a sexagenarian, when you can say no to everything with impunity, and anticipates his next decade, when – why bother speaking? – a dismissive wave should suffice.It’s a lovely joke, but an unlikely scenario. Because nothing tonight suggests that, even at 65, Seinfeld’s appetite for talking – far less his aptitude – is remotely on the wane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d01c8ea27b86529999e1d519d7ac135754d2913/912_784_2523_1514/master/2523.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd945b544c6ec3dba8e7a35debf0b541","title":"review the nico project the stoller hall maxine peake manchester international festival","story":"The Stoller Hall, ManchesterWith fascinating – and frustrating – results, the actor plays a woman seemingly possessed by the ghost of the late Velvet Underground singerWhen 1980s Manchester resident Nico released her second solo album, she discarded her image as a beautiful model operating in the world of pop (albeit the warped pop of the Velvet Underground) to create something dark, austere and poetic. Released in 1968, The Marble Index was an unsettling collision of modernist classical orchestration, doomy vocals and the discordant throb of a harmonium. “I suspect that if you’re ever in the perfect mood to play The Marble Index, then it’s probably the last thing you should be playing,” said Dorian Lynskey in the .If you’re going to pay tribute to an experimental album, there’s a logic in putting on an experimental show. Commissioned by the Manchester international festival, actor Maxine Peake and director Sarah Frankcom have assembled an all-female company, including an orchestra from the Royal Northern College of Music dressed in the tunics and neckerchiefs of the Hitler youth, to evoke something of the singer’s troubled worldview. Unfortunately, in the case of EV Crowe’s script, “experimental” means never getting to the end of a sentence and never declaring your purpose.Peake could be compelling reading the phone book, and her performance as a woman seemingly possessed by the ghost of Nico is equal parts fascinating and frustrating. With heavy eyeliner and long fringe, she talks cryptically about searching for a person, a feeling, the truth (it’s hard to say for sure), switching from her own voice to the singer’s deep Germanic slur and back again. There’s no doubting the atmosphere of nightmarish desperation, but it’d help to know who she was and why she was taking on Nico’s demons.The uncertainty is doubly frustrating because, when the music kicks in, it can be tremendous. Anna Clyne’s arrangements of songs such as Frozen Warnings and Evening of Light have a scary intensity, all troubling double bass, fidgety violins and strident kettle drums, made edgier still by the terror-stricken look of the players as they scatter about the stage. It ends with Peake alone in the gloom singing an a cappella Nibelungen, but, however bleak and forlorn, its impact is diminished by the lack of context."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f916166db800574f603d253963ee0c4a5ca1d4/0_0_3488_2777/master/3488.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fe6315a1998191bda183f2db3e72c68 720w","title":"may i have a word about politicians","story":"The common misuse of language make a vast difference to its meaningA dowager type, a minor character in a whimsical British film made before the Second World War (Once In A New Moon, since you ask), is quite emphatic about the perils of generosity to the lower classes:“Give them an inch and they will take an ell,” she proclaims in one scene. Today most of her audience would be much more familiar with the common usage, “Give them an inch and they will take a mile”. But, as proverbs go, that has always sounded a bit off. A mile is just too long a distance to work properly. And, sure enough, an “ell” is a forearm’s length to the elbow, measured by making the shape of a letter “L”.It is a nice reminder of what we lose when a phrase is modernised or superseded. Not only can a bit of sense be mislaid, but memory of the original form is soon obliterated.Recently we have exchanged “in the olden days” for the American idiom “back in the day” on a fairly wholesale basis. It probably just sounded a bit cooler to someone once and has now wiped out nearly all trace of its predecessor. It is not so much the change I mourn, but the forgetting. It is a sign of how adaptable language is, yet also a tiny symptom of human ability to unconsciously vaporise the past.Our parliamentarians are not much cop at passing key legislation, but they do get a lot of airtime and so have more impact on language than they should. In the past few years the word “substantive”, favoured by politicians, has taken over from the word “substantial” by those who want to make a point in the voice of authority.The words do not mean quite the same thing though.

Can you find it?”It’s not an easy task. There are dozens of prominent colourful flowers within arm’s reach of David. These dunes, on close inspection, are an eye-popping floral cornucopia. But at last I spot it: three gorgeous pink petals arranged around a central lobe of deep claret and yellow. It looks a lot like a spectacular insect.“Bee orchid,” says David. “Actually, there are two other species of orchid to your right.”One of them is easy: a fiery pyramid of scarlet florets named, prosaically, pyramidal orchid. The other takes a little longer as the flower is green. David eventually takes pity and points it out: a twayblade orchid, a tall spike of inconspicuous green flowers. Not all are so unobtrusive: August will bring the autumn lady’s tresses orchid, for example, with spirals of white flowers on stems up to a foot long. “We’ve got orchids here from April to September,” David tells me, “Fourteen or 15 species.”“You don’t know exactly?”We walk up a grassy dune and there, in the distance, is the Port Talbot steel works. I can read the giant Tata logo on the building. It might seem surprising that the 1,300-acre Kenfig national nature reserve, one of our most valuable patches of conservation land, is so near the industrial heart of south Wales. A bit like the British steel industry, however, this fragile wilderness is also threatened. David is himself an endangered species: there used to be five wildlife wardens here, giving guided walks, manning a handsome visitor centre, pointing out the orchids to less observant visitors like myself. Now only David and a small band of enthusiastic volunteers remain.We stroll along a long, low damp area, known as a slack, and find a huge orchid nestled in a bank: the flower stalk must be 18 inches tall and on top, not yet emerged, a juicy stack of imminent flowers. “Orchids hybridise like crazy,” David explains. “This one has got elements of a spotted orchid and also a pyramidal. That’s the problem. Some experts will split a species in two, others will lump them together.” He laughs. “So we have 14 or 15.”Something flies past, buzzing, and David is off up the path. “Get your camera! Quick!” We rush off to a flower-fringed area and stop. David points out a large pale bumblebee. “That’s a shrill carder bee – I haven’t seen one in years.”It is, in fact, Britain’s rarest bee, a creature known only from a few coastal sites in Wales and southern England. We linger a while, spotting two lizards basking on a wooden post and a pair of cuckoos who zoom briskly away. Then David decides to show me the reserve’s true rarity.We head back to the slack and, next to a cane jammed in the ground, there is a small inconspicuous orchid, beautiful on close inspection. “That is a fen orchid and it is only found here.”The story of this flower is remarkable. Back in the 1990s, when David first arrived at Kenfig, there were thousands, but year by year they declined. “I got quite paranoid,” he says. “It seemed like I only had to look at one and it would disappear.”By 2015 there were, he estimated, around 200 remaining – the entire British population. Then a new strategy of cutting the grass and even scraping the surface of the dune slack was begun. “The flower actually survives on shifting dune systems. It needed the disturbance.” Now numbers are back to over 1,000 and Kenfig attracts botanists from all over the world, the best time to see them being in June.I leave the place in awe of its delicate beauty. I’ve seen two species that are each rarer than the tiger or rhino and I’m a mile from the M4. I want to know what other unexpected gems this area harbours.At the nearby seaside town of Porthcawl I rent a fat bike (£10 per hour) and take a long, lazy ride along the sands – there are miles of them – stopping when the River Ogmore blocks my progress. Then I walk into the Merthyr Mawr dune system, neighbour to Kenfig. Almost immediately I’m spotting pyramidal orchids and lots of bees. A rabbit watches me from behind the blue spikes of viper’s-bugloss flowers and red-caped cinnabar moths flit ahead.By the time I get back, I’m itching to get into the sea, so I head down to Porthcawl Surf school (beginner’s lesson from £30) and grab a lesson as the tide goes out. Hugh Murray started the business after the 2008 financial crash left him jobless. It proved a shrewd decision as the beach is only three-and-a-half hours from London. “You can do it in a day,” he points out.With the sun bursting out, we head to the breakers. Hugh turns out to be a fine tutor. Within an hour I stand up on a moving surf board and ride a wave. Sadly Hugh, camera in hand, is momentarily distracted and misses the triumph, one rarer than any living creature in UK and unlikely to be seen again. Let’s hope the fen orchid and shrill carder bee fare better.• The trip was provided by Bridgend Tourism.

And you may not be able to get back inside your house if it’s not safe.Our camping stuff was stored in the garage, but instead I took it all and moved it outside, so we could camp, cook, and live in our yard. I also put a big box of survival gear in the trunk of my car. And then you’re supposed to store water as well – so that’s where the jacuzzi comes in. It’s not usually water you’d want to drink or cook with, but it is a huge water supply. Our barbecue has propane tanks which would allow me to cook food using the jacuzzi water for a few weeks without power. It’s not what I would usually use to drink from, since we’ve been sitting in it, but when it comes to an emergency, it would work. We might want to put a little bleach in it.We need to be reminded of the topic on a regular basis. I have it easier in that regard, as people asking me about preparedness puts it back in my own mind. Actually, after I first heard from the , I finally bought a solar cellphone charger earlier this week. I also made sure I still have a flashlight in my night table.We used to live in Atlanta, and while we were there we had a rare 5.0 earthquake. I was sitting in the kitchen, working, when the house started shaking. I couldn’t figure out what it was, so I walked over to my computer and logged on to the US Geological Survey website. Studies show that people tend to not to drop, cover and hold, which is what you’re supposed to do. Instead, they do what I did and freeze. When we moved back to Seattle, I knew I’d have to prepare for the risk for large earthquakes. I study risk perception, and it’s really hard to think about preparing for a high-consequence but low-probability event. It might or might not happen in your lifetime – or even your child’s lifetime.In our household such plans are a household affair rather than my personal plans. We have a designated meeting spot should a quake happen during the workday, a generator, a box of emergency boat rations, a water heater and a rain barrel that could provide backup water supplies, and canned goods.We provided one of our neighbors with backup power for their freezer in a power outage this last year. Friends and family figure large in our thinking about preparedness – how we could help them and one another. We live on a cul-de-sac and we know everyone around us.And we’ve joked about grilling the wild bunnies and ducks who live in the park behind our house, more frequently as the bunnies have multiplied and invaded everyone’s gardens this summer.My work takes me to immediate post-disaster settings, so I have witnessed, repeatedly, the on-the-ground realities of what the world is like after a major natural hazard event, and this has informed my “planning”.Last fall, for instance, I traveled to Indonesia in the aftermath of the Sulawesi earthquake. It was there that I saw thousands of people who had survived the quake, but who were suffering because of lack of sanitation, medical services and housing, and had to wait for relief efforts which ned many weeks.This has taught me that we must not only make it through the event but also its aftermath. My plan is a full tank of gas in the car, as I plan to leave the area for days or weeks, provided that road damage does not close the highways. In the case of Seattle, I expect that there will be no water, nor electricity, nor fuel available for quite a while after a major earthquake.And when I leave the house, I will close the door, but I will not be too concerned about locking it down, because I know from experience in past disasters that there will be no looting, only people searching for food, bottled water and other essentials for survival.Los Angeles sits atop the San Andreas fault. A 7.8 earthquake along the southern section  could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213bn in damageAs a scientist I assess everything in my house for its utility. I keep two spare tanks for my gas grill, so in case of an earthquake I can use the grill to cook food. I used to have an on-demand tankless water heater – but I got rid of it because I want to use my water heater as a tank for water. It holds 40 gallons, which is a great supply – though you want to make sure it’s strapped down.The biggest thing, especially in LA, will be water. I’m in the process of putting a pool in my backyard, and if you distill the water to remove salts, I would not be shy about drinking pool water. Plus: with the salt in it, it’s already useful for cooking pasta.I keep a few hundred dollars in small bills, one- and five-dollar increments, because if we do have power outages and you have 20-dollar bills only, you won’t be able to purchase anything.I sleep with a hammer under my bed so I can break out of a window in my house. They sell earthquake hammers that also include a key to the gas main in the street – you’d need a tool to remove the plate and turn off the gas in the case of a gas line break. You can buy these hammers for around $10 at Home Depot.In my car, I always keep running shoes, a warm shirt and a few gallons of water. You never know where you’re going to end up and you may have to walk home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4679bd8cd02a7a14d26140b0d1c8802d08186/400_608_3676_2207/master/3676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a776fc505c9c0f5971e732238e121e4d","title":"bent pyramid egypt opens ancient oddity for tourism","story":"Pharoah Sneferu’s structure marks key step in Egyptian architecture, as builders had to change the angle when it started to crack Egypt has opened to visitors the “bent” pyramid built for the pharaoh Sneferu, a 101-metre structure south of Cairo that marks a key step in the evolution of pyramid construction.Tourists will now be able to clamber down a 79-metre long, narrow tunnel from a raised entrance on the pyramid’s northern face, to reach two chambers deep inside the 4,600-year-old structure.They will also be able to enter an adjoining 18-metre high “side pyramid”, possibly for Sneferu’s wife Hetepheres, opened for the first time since its excavation in 1956.The “bent” Pyramid is one of three built for Fourth Dynasty founding pharaoh Sneferu in Dahshur, at the southern end of the Memphis necropolis, a Unesco world heritage site. Its appearance is unusual. The first 49 metres, which have largely kept their smooth limestone casing, are built at a steep 54 degree angle, before tapering off towards the top. It has been reopened to the public for the first time since 1965, when it was closed for restoration works.The angular shape contrasts with the straight sides of Sneferu’s Red Pyramid just to the north, the first of ancient Egypt’s fully formed pyramids and the next step towards the Great Pyramid of Giza.Architects changed the angle of the “bent” pyramid when cracks started appearing in the structure, said Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities.“Sneferu lived a very long time … the architects wanted to reach the complete shape, the pyramid shape,” Mohamed Shiha, director of the Dahshur site, said.Authorities are seeking to promote tourism at Dahshur, about 28km (17 miles) south of central Cairo. The site lies in the open desert, attracts just a trickle of visitors, and is free of the touts and bustle of Giza.As they opened the pyramids, archaeologists presented late-period mummies, masks, tools and coffins discovered during excavations that began near the Dahshur pyramids last year and are due to continue.“When we were taking those objects out, we found … a very rich area of hidden tombs,” Waziri said.The promotion of Dahshur is part of a wider push to boost tourism, an important source of foreign revenue for Egypt that dipped steeply after the country’s 2011 uprising but has gradually recovered. Archaeologists also unveiled the nearby tomb of Sa Eset, which has been closed since its excavation in 1894 and contains finely preserved hieroglyphic funerary texts.Foreign ambassadors invited to attend the archaeological announcements were led sweating into the tight spaces of the tomb, which is not expected to be opened to the public for another two years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8b1faf96746f0f4b1cd57d389684ee211bd3ea7/194_382_1751_1050/master/1751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4db636e34ad40fa626188cbeb33958cb","title":"emanuela orlandi vatican remains found pontifical teutonic college","story":"One of Rome’s most enduring mysteries – the 1983 disappearance of 15-year-old Emanuela Orlandi, a Vatican employee’s daughter – took a new twist on Saturday when papal authorities announced that they had discovered two sets of bones under a stone manhole.On Thursday the Vatican had pried open the tombs of two 19th-century German princesses in the cemetery of the Pontifical Teutonic College after Emanuela’s family had received a tip that her remains might be buried there. But the tombs turned out to be completely empty, creating yet another mystery over the whereabouts of the dead princesses.The Vatican pledged further investigation and on Saturday a spokesman said they had “identified two ossuaries, located under the pavement of an area inside the Pontifical Teutonic College, covered by a manhole”.He said the area had been sealed off and would be opened for forensic experts to investigate this week.The last recorded structural work at the college and its cemetery was in the 1960s and 70s. Orlandi disappeared in 1983 after leaving her family’s Vatican City apartment to go to a music lesson in Rome. Her father was a lay employee of the Holy See. Over the years her disappearance has been linked to everything from the plot to kill Pope John Paul II to the financial scandal of the Vatican bank and Rome’s criminal underworld. The last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Orlandi’s remains as well. The search turned up no link.Last year bones were found underneath the Vatican’s embassy to Italy in Rome. Italian media immediately speculated the remains could belong to Orlandi or another girl who went missing around the same time. But forensic tests showed the bones long pre-dated their disappearances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f451e88a0f74f943ae5be8d902bde8fea3c7ff10/0_275_7031_4218/master/7031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5eaf5c768d79a0ee36c4cc16cfa88b","title":"viktor orban budapest hungary christianity with a twist","story":"Hungary’s far-right leader using Christian message to justify his immigration policy“Europe can ignore or deny or struggle against its own identity and its Christian roots. But by doing so the society commits suicide,” said László Kiss-Rigó, the bishop of Szeged, as he drove into Budapest on a recent afternoon. “And the more migrants that come, the more Christian values will be watered down.”Christian values, or a particular interpretation of them, have become the centrepiece of Hungarian government messaging under its far-right leader, Viktor Orbán, and Kiss-Rigó operates at the nexus of the prime minister’s interests.As well as his role as bishop, he is also the chairman of Szeged’s local football team, which is owned by the church. He was in Budapest to make arrangements for the inaugural concert at a new multipurpose stadium, which will be opened later this summer with an appearance by Placido Domingo – just one part of the massive investment that the football-mad Orbán has made into the sport.On the matter of migration, and much else, Kiss-Rigó and Orbán are singing from the same hymn sheet. The bishop denies, for example, that putting up walls to keep people out of the country doesn’t fit with Christian values. “Everyone who knocks at your door and asks admission is welcome to be examined. But people who jump into your house through the roof should be protected against,” he said.Now in his third consecutive term, Orbán has increasingly used far-right and anti-migrant rhetoric as he cements control of the country in increasingly authoritarian fashion. He used to describe his system as an “illiberal democracy”, but recently he has changed focus, preferring instead to call it a “Christian democracy”. The government’s messaging is still based around stopping immigration and protecting a “besieged” Europe from outsiders, but it now comes in increasingly Christian packaging, both at home and abroad.At a lavish party to mark US independence day in Budapest, Orbán told guests that finally, with the accession of Donald Trump, there was an “overlap of values” between the US and Hungary. “Neither of us is willing to accept the hypocrisy of modern politics, which neglects the fact that Christianity is the most persecuted religion globally,” he said. In a sign of just how much things have changed in the relationship over the past few years, Trump’s ambassador David Cornstein called Orbán a “perfect partner” and arranged for his old friend, the singer Paul Anka, to serenade the Hungarian prime minister.Trump himself lavished praise on Orbán during a May visit to the White House that ended years of isolation in which top US officials shunned Orbán’s government over rule-of-law concerns. “You have been great with respect to Christian communities. You have really put a block up and we appreciate that very much,” said Trump, apparently referring to the fence Orbán’s government has built along Hungary’s southern border to keep out migrants.The Hungarian Catholic church, the largest church in the country, has been supportive of Orbán’s hardline policies on migration, despite frequent calls from the pope for Europe to be more tolerant and understanding of the suffering of those who have fled war and poverty.Since then, he has frequently invoked Christian values, but of late the intensity has increased.Now, barely a month goes by without Orbán hosting a delegation of Christian leaders from somewhere in the world. Next year, Budapest will host the International Eucharistic Congress, an international gathering of tens of thousands of Catholics from across the world designed to celebrate the actual presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, which will be accompanied by a vast outdoor mass and various entertainment programmes. The Hungarian State Opera has even announced its forthcoming season will showcase only works that deal with Christian themes.But there’s one problem with all this: the policies of Orbán’s government don’t seem to be particularly Christian. One recent law saw the criminalisation of homelessness, penalising the street sleepers who are a frequent sight in the underpasses and courtyards of Budapest, rather than dealing with the problem’s causes. Asylum seekers are held in shipping containers in special transit zones near Hungary’s border fence, and the country’s policy of denying food to failed asylum seekers was branded “an unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe” by a human rights group. Government-controlled media often uses dehumanising rhetoric about migrants and refugees.Kiss-Rigó, who believes that most migrants at the Hungarian border are wealthier than the police repelling them, and that “only a tiny minority” are actually refugees, sidestepped questions on whether he agreed with the pope’s calls for tolerance.Others have been less reticent. A journalist and founding member of Orbán’s Fidesz party, Zsolt Bayer, said in 2016 that the pope was “either a senile old fool or a scoundrel” for his pro-refugee sentiments.Not all of Hungary’s religious leaders feel the same. Gábor Iványi, a Methodist priest with a flowing, white beard who runs a homeless shelter in the scruffy eighth district of Budapest, was formerly on good terms with Orbán and even officiated at his (second, religious) wedding ceremony, but now decries the prime minster’s policies as being the opposite of Christian teachings. Last summer, he tried to distribute food to people being held in the transit zones, but was denied access. Some critics suggest that “Christian values” is code for something else altogether. “There’s just no doubt that this is organised as a way of saying that ‘Christianity’ means ‘white conservative Europe’. It’s a trope. Say the world ‘Christian’ and it says everything else that you want to say,” said Michael Ignatieff, rector of the Central European University, which is moving part of its operations from Budapest to Vienna after the government denied it accreditation.Kiss-Rigó would perhaps agree. He conceded that Hungarians are much less religious than Poles, for example, but defined “Christian values” in vague cultural terms: as much about shutting out the Muslim “other” as about any sense of personal religious belief. His favourite author is the British anti-Islam commentator Douglas Murray, and he said Europe was in danger of being turned into a “easily manipulable faceless mass” by unspecified dark forces.“I’m not saying all of this because I hope that next Sunday more people will come to church. In Europe, even an atheist is a Christian,” he said.Hungary’s foreign policy has also been taking on an increasingly Christian hue. A special “Hungary Helps” programme has been set up to provide aid to persecuted Christians in Africa and the Middle East. “Help should be provided where the trouble lies instead of bringing the trouble to Europe,” said a spokesman for the programme. He said it had disbursed $30m in aid in the past two years, almost exclusively to help Christian communities or projects backed by Christian groups.As Budapest has come in for increasing criticism from Brussels over rule-of-law concerns and democratic backsliding, Orbán has wooed other far-right leaders who use Christian rhetoric. He was the only EU leader to attend the inauguration of Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro in January, while he enjoys a warm relationship with the Law and Justice government in Poland.Katalin Novák, Hungary’s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, has also had a busy travel schedule, meeting rightwing and Christian groups in many countries to showcase the government’s policies on improving birth rates and promoting traditional values. In March, she gave the keynote address at a conference organised by the Hungarian embassy in Washington entitled “Making Families Great Again”, attended by a number of rightwing American Christian groups.“We think that the problems of Europe can be traced back to the denial of Christian roots. We see the misinterpretation of tolerance many times. Being tolerant should not mean that one gives up his or her identity,” said Novák, in written responses to questions.These talking points have hit home with some rightwing Republicans, improving the standing of Orbán in Washington, and meaning some officials ended up more suspicious of NGOs and opposition activists than of Orbán’s government. “Wrapping itself in the words of being a Christian nation, with traditional values, created a subtext that critics are not legitimately concerned about the deterioration of the rule of law, but instead motivated by a progressive and pro-LGBT agenda,” said Scott Cullinane, who until last year was professional staff member on a congressional subcommittee dealing with Hungary.Orbán’s position in Europe looks to be weakened after the recent European elections and a series of scandals among potential far-right allies, which means the approval of Trump and rightwing republicans is a useful blessing.“We are very happy that there are a few politicians like Orbán and Trump who really represent those values which we Christians believe to be important,” said Kiss-Rigó, when asked if it was plausible to hold up the US president as a paragon of Christian virtue. For him, as for Orbán, the backlash against liberalism is more important than any specific Christian virtues.“I don’t think he will be canonised in the Catholic church but this is not the point. After the attempted dictatorship of nihilism, manipulated by the PC-talkers, his personality is a refreshing one.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3955182.1562956162!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"renewed putsch looms in germany s far right afd party","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexander Gauland (left) and Björn Höcke have differing visions of the AfD. Photograph: Getty More than 100 members of Germany’s populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) have warned that the party is in danger of being hijacked by its far-right flank.In an open letter, leading AfD officials warned that regional leader Björn Höcke, party head in the eastern state of Thuringia, is aiming to take over the party, shift even further right and squeeze out remaining conservatives and liberals.“The AfD is not and will not be a Björn Höcke party,” the letter said, saying they reject the “cult of personality” around the regional leader some members have compared to Nazi propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels.Their letter was a response to Höcke’s star turn at a regional gathering of AfD nationalists and “patriots” last weekend. As about 800 supporters cheered and waved German flags, Höcke called into question the contribution of immigrants to Germany’s post-war economy.“The policy of open borders practised for decades . . . this irrational migration policy . . . has bled us financially as if we had lost another war,” said Höcke, who has risen to prominence by happily courting controversy.Last year he narrowly avoided being ejected from the party after suggesting that Germany’s “stupid” efforts to remember and learn from its Nazi past had “crippled” the country.Now he is at the centre of party attention again thanks to his nationalist “Flügel” flank, which has taken control of regional parties in at least five federal states.Last weekend Höcke defended his “Flügel” as a casual organisation with “no membership cards or numbers, just patriots who don’t want to give up on this country”.It was not his “Flügel”that is trying to ide the AfD, Höcke insisted, but others in the party – including the national party leadership.Listening to his speech was one of those leaders: Alexander Gauland, Bundestag co-leader in Berlin. He is no no stranger to provocation, describing the 12-year Third Reich as “a pile of bird shit” on an otherwise glorious panorama of German history.But at last weekend’s gathering Gauland, for years a dominant figure in the party, warned nationalist AfD members to watch their words or endanger a looming election breakthrough.Ahead of three autumn elections, polls show the AfD running neck-and-neck with the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Saxony, in first place in Brandenburg and second place in Thuringia.The AfD was not created “to create a space in which everyone can say everything”, said Gauland, predicting that embracing crude, nationalist language would scare away more moderate voters.It remains to be seen if Gauland can survive the latest uprising in the party. After already toppling two leaders in its six-year existence, Höcke appears to be gearing up the AfD for a third putsch. On Friday it emerged that he had agreed a political pact behind Gauland’s back with his Bundestag co-leader, Alice Weidel.A leading far-right ideologue within the party, Götz Kubitschek, said on Friday that Weidel had realised that the party “cannot shake off Björn Höcke and his network without causing damage”.“All are in agreement that calming things down in the party is one of the most important tasks,” wrote Kubitschek in a blog post.Founded in 2013 as a Eurosceptic party and bailout critic, the AfD narrowly avoided entering the Bundestag parliament that year.

ten students get less ddd a level leave university top","story":" 69 per cent of students with DDD at A-level went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degreeUniversities have been warned over degree class inflation as an analysis reveals that seven in ten students who get less than DDD grades at A-level go on to graduate with top degrees.  Of the 3,025 students who went to university last year after achieving less than DDD, 69 per cent went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degree.  This is seven per cent higher than the previous year, and a 73 per cent increase since 201011, according to a major report published on Thursday by the Office for Students (OfS).    Those who left school with less than DDD last year were four times more likely to graduate with a first class degree compared to seven years ago, the data showed.  The watchdog noted in its report that it had observed the “greatest increase in attainment” in degree outcomes for those who left school with less than DDD in their A-levels or the equivalent.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action” so that degree class inflation is “stamped out”.  He called the figures “disappointing”, adding that they “risk compromising the public trust in the high standards of our universities”.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action”Damian Hinds said that quality in higher education must be protected “at all costs” and called on the regulator to demand that universities with unjustified rises provide evidence of what they are doing about it.     The OfS analysed the degrees awarded by 148 universities in England between 201011 and 201718.  It found that four in five of all students (79 per cent) now graduate with either a first or upper second class degree, up from 29 per cent seven years ago.  Almost a third (29 per cent) are awarded a first class degree compared to 16 per cent in 201011. After controlling for factors such as students working harder and improvements in teaching, the OfS said that 13.9 per cent of the increase in first class degrees remained unaccounted for.  The higher education watchdog has previously threatened institutions with sanctions, including fines or even de-registration, if they fail to take action over the issue.Institutions found to be artificially inflating their grades can be hit with sanctions by the OfS, including fines or even stripping them of their status as a university. Secondary legislation will be passed later this year to beef up the regulator\u0027s powers and allow it to levy fines of whichever is greater out of £500,000 or two per cent of the university\u0027s income.   Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the OfS, warned that concerns over grade inflation “threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students”. She said that the OfS will contact universities with the most significant and unexplained increases in degree classification.A committee of vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders reviewed ways to tackle grade inflation and published a “statement of intent” in May which set out their plans to tackle the issue.They agreed that “strong and decisive action” was needed to tackle perceptions that degrees are being “dumbed down”.Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: “It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated,” he said.Bones found after tombs exhumed in hunt for girl who went missing in Vatican City 30 years agoHow

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, he realised, there was no subscription service for books. Thus was born Perlego (Latin for “I read through” or “I scan”), the Spotify of textbooks. Van Malderen even went on to write his thesis on the subject, “Why the Old Textbook Model is Broken”.There is a scandal, verging on a scam, in the realm of textbooks. Since 1982, the price of textbooks has risen at three times the rate of inflation. Some figures depict a tenfold increase. As if students didn’t have enough trouble already with tuition fees. They would be justified in feeling it’s a rip-off, up there with secondary ticketing for gigs and flights to Madrid when there’s a Champions League Cup Final on. Perlego aims to make learning accessible, without perhaps killing off libraries completely. “Students can still go to the library to study,” says its CEO and co-founder Van Malderen.Gauthier Van Malderen, 26, was born in Belgium, lived in Henley-on-Thames as a kid, and was an undergraduate in economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan. His dad is in banking and his parents expected him to go into finance. “They nearly had a heart attack when I mentioned textbooks online.” They’ve swung around since. Van Malderen the younger is really responding to student need. When he was still an undergraduate he noticed that most students were using notepads so he set up a business producing very classy notepads, called\u0026nbspIconic Matter (“made by students for students”) with advertising from big companies at the bottom of the page, selling them in Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco. He made enough money out of that scheme to launch Perlego, together with backing from the founder of Zoopla, Alex Chesterman.There are a couple of open access websites where you can download books for free, such as OpenStax, funded by Bill Gates – but it’s non-profit, and Van Malderen is on the side of writers as much as readers.\u0026nbsp“If you’re going to produce high quality work, then it would be nice to get paid.” Van Malderen is sympathetic towards professors. “They don’t want students to have to pay through the nose. They don’t ‘adopt’\u0026nbsptextbooks anymore” (ie\u0026nbspmaking them required reading). In the context of universities trying to open up access, the question of affordability becomes more crucial than ever.We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutionsThe other possible avenue for impecunious students is, of course, theft, not so much nicking books from the library, more using piracy websites. Sitting at a laptop in his offices in Holborn, Gauthier showed me how he could illicitly download the pdf of a classic textbook, Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice, entirely for free. “No wonder publishers are having a hard time,” says van Malderen. “There is a vicious spiral effect. They lose 28 per cent\u0026nbspto piracy, 30 per cent\u0026nbspto second-hand sales.” In short, at present, publishers, authors, and students all end up feeling ripped off.Apparently 88 per cent\u0026nbspof students don’t see piracy as a crime. Van Malderen thinks legal can be cooler. “We can show them the convenience of having one space – a one-stop shop – where you can get all your books. And no one gets ripped off.” The average spend on textbooks in the UK is £439 (medicine will cost a lot more than English) in the US it’s $1,200. The cost of subscribing to Perlego is £12 a month.Perlego also hosts all those public domain books, like The Odyssey and Das Kapital. “The culture has changed,” Van Malderen says. “It’s like music – you don’t want to own the book anymore.” Perlego is a streaming service. You don’t download, you read the book page by page online, on your phone if you like. It’s a “mobile-first learning experience”, as Van Malderen describes it. You can create your own library, like a playlist. And unlike the books in the university library, you can legitimately scribble in the margins and underline sentences, personalising the text.You can become part of a network of readers, with input from other students, so you can compare notes, and get comments from professors too. It’s a virtual seminar that feels like it could make the real, traditional learning environment redundant. “We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutions,” says Van Malderen. “We’re just aiming to make learning more efficient.” It’s like reading, plus social media, where you can “follow” other readers if you like. There is potential for “lifelong learning” too. 25 per cent\u0026nbspof Perlego subscribers are not students, but professionals (or would-be professionals) seeking to upgrade.How do you plan Wimbledon? It’s all about attention to detail‘If we get one person to give up cow’s milk, we’ve made a difference’Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulAccording to the aggregate data Perlego has collected, psychology is the biggest growth area in higher education, which is good for psychology professors\u0026nbspand publishers to know. But the main intellectual advantage of the online system is that, whatever subject you’re studying, you can always dabble in something else – you’re not restricted to the books specified in your course. “For example,” says Van Malderen, “I was doing economics, but say I wanted to branch out into political science or philosophy, it’s right here”. It’s a whole online library rather than just a bunch of textbooks.A declaration of interest: I teach at Cambridge. I know from personal experience that one thing that always drives students mad is how to put in references at the end of their essays. I’m not one for making recommendations, but I think the next time a student asks me how to do it (and I know it’s going to go wrong somehow), I might say, “Have you tried Perlego?”. All you have to do is skip to the references section, highlight, copy, then paste. Full marks.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on. Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

First of all, the pound is likely to drop significantly against other major currencies, as happened in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum.‘Many thousands’ of jobs lost in no-deal Brexit, minister warnsThis will rapidly increase the cost of imported raw materials and components at the same time as businesses have to deal with disruptions to their supply chain as the free movement of goods and services ends abruptly.Additional tariffs will further add to the cost of doing business as will non-tariff barriers such as customs checks, additional paperwork and quotas.Some businesses, such as those which rely heavily on sourcing parts from across the continent, will become unprofitable and inevitably have to lay off staff or even shut down completely.We have a number of forecasts of what this might mean for employment.In December, academics at the University of Sussex predicted that a no-deal scenario will cost 750,000 UK jobs, including 150,000 in London and over 80,000 in the northwest of England.Analysis by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by the mayor of London forecasts 87,000 jobs lost in the capital by 2030 out of a nationwide total of half a million.Across the EU, around 1.2 million jobs would be lost, according to a recent paper from the University of Leuven. It concluded that Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands would be the worst affected by a no-deal Brexit, with Dublin losing 50,330 jobs or 2.6 per cent of its entire workforce.This week the Northern Irish government sounded the alarm with a warning that the country would lose 40,000 jobs after a no-deal Brexit, primarily as a result of disruptions to trade with the Republic.While there is considerable variation in the predictions, all certainly support the business secretary’s assertion.The Bank of England’s Gertjan Vlieghe pointed to a further problem on Friday: that British workers,\u0026nbsphighly indebted and with low levels of savings, are ill-equipped to deal with the sudden slump in the labour market that Brexit may bring.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Campaigner Gina Miller today announced her own legal fight against the move, and Mr Hammond has even floated the idea of an MPs’ “sit-in” in the Commons chamber if Mr Johnson tries to close the doors.Gina Miller legal bid to stop Boris Johnson suspending parliamentNo-deal Brexit set to hit business for £22bn a yearBoris Johnson vs Andrew Neil confirmed we’re heading for Brexit crisisHow bad will a no-deal Brexit really be for jobs?Ms Rudd told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: “I think that proroguing Parliament would be a mistake. MPs across both parties at every level think it is the wrong thing to do and I would urge any prime minister to put that aside.“I would use my own tactics to try to stop that happening and I encourage anyone else to consider their own version as well.”Mr Hammond told a BBC Panorama Brexit special that there would be a limit to the amount of influence the Government could exert in the event of no-deal, despite having spent more than £4 billion on preparations.“Many of the levers are held by others - the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspor private business,” he said. “We can seek to persuade them but we can\u0027t control it.“For example, we can make sure that goods flow inwards through the port of Dover without any friction but we can\u0027t control the outward flow into the port of Calais.”The French can dial that up or dial it down, just the same as the Spanish for years have dialled up or dialled down the length of the queues at the border going into Gibraltar.“Mr Hammond - who said earlier this month that a disorderly Brexit could cost the Exchequer up to £90 billion - has long warned against the dangers of leaving without a deal with Brussels.The Chancellor, who has indicated he does not expect to remain in post once there is a new prime minister in No 10, is reported to be at the head of a group of around 30 Tory\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdetermined to prevent no-deal.Ms Thornberry took advantage of Labour’s new pro-referendum policy to join a People’s Vote rally on Sunday in Mr Johnson’s Uxbridge and Ruislip South constituency.“We can’t just hand our country over to Boris Johnson and let him do whatever he wants with it,” she said. “We have got some sort of gentlemanly coup going on at the moment, with people in the Home Counties deciding who the next prime minister should be.”Appearing on the Marr Show shortly before the demonstration, she was asked whether the new policy unveiled by Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday meant Labour \u0026nbspwas now “a Remain party”, and replied: “Sounds pretty Remain to me.”The shadow foreign secretary stressed that Labour had not signed up to a trade union position that the next manifesto should include a pledge to negotiate a softer “jobs-first” Brexit, subject to a referendum, if Mr Corbyn wins power.Although she accepted she did not know what the manifesto position would be, she said she could “see the logic” of it offering a referendum in which Labour would campaign for Remain.“I’m not allowed to write the manifesto,” she said. “I can tell you what I would argue for and what I think is likely to be in the manifesto, but I can’t tell you what will be in the manifesto because it hasn’t been written yet.”Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Sir Ed Davey, whose party put on more than 2 million votes in May’s European elections as Remain-backing voters switched from Labour, \u0026nbspsaid that if Mr Corbyn won power he would implement his own Brexit plan.“They aren’t a Remain party, they are a Brexit party still,” Davey told Marr.Created with Sketch.A historic moment: thousands march to demand Final Say on Brexit Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An estimated 700,000 people marched through London to demand a final say on the withdrawal agreementRed smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

I started running in 1948 when I was a boy and since that time I have never left.”For the 20th time, and since its inception, Ruengo has crossed the finish line holding his national flag at the Safaricom Marathon in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (LWC), a Unesco World Heritage site.\u0026nbspThe marathon is one of the toughest races in the world, and the only one to take place through a wildlife reserve. With an altitude of more than 5,500ft above sea level, a large part of the course is uphill, rolling across savannah plains and acacia woodland. There’s no respite from northern Kenya’s harsh sun, and participants battle the dust whipped up from the dirt road.\u0026nbsp“It’s got all the worst combinations,” says David Thuo, an aircraft engineer from Nairobi who completed the half marathon. “The altitude is very high, it goes uphill ... but I did get to see giraffes.”Runners say it’s the wildlife and landscape that draws them to these remote plains in\u0026nbspLewa. Sixteen-year-old runner\u0026nbspWinfred, who came in the top 10 in the children’s\u0026nbsp5km\u0026nbsprace, says she “enjoyed seeing the wildlife. It’s a special race.”Created with Sketch.On a walking safari in Kenya\u0027s Maasai Mara Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sunrise over the conservancyCheetahs at Naboisho CampSundowners at Naboisho CampA starry night at Naboisho CampSunrise over the conservancyCheetahs at Naboisho CampSundowners at Naboisho CampA starry night at Naboisho CampA 61,000-acre area of protected land, the conservancy is home to critically endangered black rhino and Grevy’s zebra, as well as elephant and the big cats. The wildlife isn’t blocked from the course – runners often pass herds of zebra or giraffe lingering in the distance.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been trying to train the lions to become vegetarian but we haven’t succeeded,” Tusk CEO Charlie Mayhew said in the briefing the night before the race, drawing a nervous laugh from the crowd.\u0026nbspLed by conservation charity Tusk and LWC, the idea to organise a marathon though the reserve came from a conversation between Mayhew and the then-CEO of Lewa conservancy in the late Nineties.500ft above sea level, a large part of the course is uphill, rolling across savannah plainsTourists staying at the lodge would often ask if they could go for a jog. “And the answer is of course you can’t – but then it sparked an idea,” says Mayhew. “What about organising a running event here and using it as a way to raise money for conservation and the LWC?”Over the years Tusk has raised $5m for conservation efforts here in Lewa and across Kenya. The conservancy and the neighbouring communities who live here are supported by funds raised by the marathon – a medical clinic has opened, while a water irrigation project in nearby farmland has reached more than 4,000 people. \u0026nbsp“When great minds come together good things happen,” says Henry Wanyoike, 45-year-old Kenyan Paralympic champion. “I’m happy to be a part of it because the community benefits, and the environment, the animals. It’s very important for everyone.” \u0026nbspWe only interfere if the less friendly species are getting close to the trackFor organisers the impact is far-reaching, “planting a seed” for future conservationists.\u0026nbspFrom just 180 runners two decades ago, the race has grown to 1,400 participants from more than 27 countries. Runners from across Kenya take part, including wildlife rangers carrying full kit who represent the neighbouring conservancies, and warriors from local communities.\u0026nbspOrganisers say they’ve reached the limit – any more infrastructure to cater for participants and spectators would have too much of an impact on the reserve and its wildlife.\u0026nbspOn the race weekend you find rows of tents, stalls and music stages for post-race celebrations making it feel like its own version of Glastonbury (it takes place over the same weekend in June as the festival). There’s airport-style security, medical staff, caterers. “It’s a logistical nightmare,” says Mayhew.Indeed, the very nature of organising a marathon through a wildlife reserve brings its own set of challenges over the safety of humans, animals and landscape.\u0026nbspIndependent researchers conduct an environmental impact assessment of the marathon on the reserve every two to three years. But Mayhew claims the impact is “remarkably low”.\u0026nbsp“There’s a huge amount of conservancy left untouched. Any wildlife that is being spooked by the race has a huge amount of space,” he says. “We only interfere if the less friendly species are getting close to the track.”It’s not an easy course. To me, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere in the worldHelicopter and a light aircraft fly overhead looking out for wildlife, while spotters are on hills overlooking the course.\u0026nbspIf any of the more dangerous species like buffalo, rhino or lion decide to get a bit too close to the track the airplane or helicopter will guide them away, using the sounds and the wind generated from the aircraft.\u0026nbspLast year a black rhino was spotted close to the course. Undeterred by the helicopter, organisers were forced to briefly stop the race until the rhino was a safe distance away.\u0026nbsp“This is what makes it so unique,” Mayhew says. “The whole idea of running in a game reserve really captures people’s imagination.”\u0026nbspOn race day the early morning haze soon turned to harsh heat.\u0026nbspRuengo\u0026nbsp(centre) celebrates at the finish line with his children“It’s not an easy course. To me, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere in the world,” says Wanyoike. “But it’s one of the best races. We’re running on our own soil which means a lot.”Wanyoike is visually impaired, and is guided with his running partner Paul holding a cord. “It’s like an umbilical cord. He has to guide me through this, tell me when we are going up hill… he’s my eyes.”This was Wanyoike’s 17th marathon at Lewa, where he achieved a personal best for the half at just over 1hr 25min. The full marathon was won by Duncan Maivo at 2hr 20min, and Emmah Kilole at 2hr 50min in the women’s race.\u0026nbspFor Kevin Bliss, a regular marathon runner based in the US, it was “by far the toughest race given the terrain and the undulation. But when it got tough, I looked around at the landscape, heard the bird noises. It was awesome.”The oldest runner, Ruengo, celebrated at the finish line with his children. “I like running because I can’t grow old so quickly. It means a lot to be here.”Will he do it again? “If God wishes, I will be here next year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But these days, Zhang Wenmin struggles to be heard.The police intimidate Ms Zhang’s sources. The authorities shut down her social media accounts. Unable to find news outlets that will publish her work, she lives largely off her savings.“The space for free speech has become so limited,” Ms Zhang said. “It’s now dangerous to say you are an independent journalist.”China’s investigative reporters once provided rare voices of accountability and criticism in a society tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party, exposing scandals about babies sickened by tainted formula and blood-selling schemes backed by the government.But under President Xi Jinping, such journalists have all but disappeared, as the authorities have harassed and imprisoned dozens of reporters and as news outlets have cut back on in-depth reporting. One of the most glaring consequences of Mr Xi’s revival of strongman politics is that the Chinese press is now almost entirely devoid of critical reporting, filled instead with upbeat portrayals of life in China under Mr Xi.Critics call it the “total censorship era.”“We’re almost extinct,” said Liu Hu, a reporter from the southwestern province of Sichuan who was detained for nearly a year after investigating corrupt politicians. “No one is left to reveal the truth.”Since rising to power in 2012, Mr Xi has transformed China’s media landscape, restoring the primacy of party-controlled news outlets while silencing independent voices. He has said that the mission of the news media should be to spread “positive energy” and to “love the party, protect the party and serve the party.”Nearly two dozen countries unite to condemn China detaining MuslimsMr Xi’s crackdown on journalists has left China, with its nearly 1.4 billion people, in what sometimes seems like an information vacuum. At a time when world leaders are asking what kind of superpower China will be, public discourse within the country is remarkably monolithic. Instead of policy debates, there are calls in the Chinese press to defend China’s socialist system. Instead of scrutiny of Chinese leaders and institutions, there are paeans to Mr Xi and the party.“The government has made its citizens ignorant,” Mr Liu said. “The public’s eyes are blind, their ears are deaf and their mouths have no words.”When Donald Trump criticises China, his words rarely appear in the mainstream Chinese press. A rapidly expanding list of topics is off limits to all but the party’s main official media outlets, among them the trade war with the United States, the #MeToo movement, gene-edited babies and the spread of African swine fever.Clayton Dube, director of the US-China Institute at the University of Southern California, said Mr Xi was sending a message that only the party had the power to criticise.“Rather than seeing investigative journalism as an aid to remedying social ills and improving governance,” he said, “Xi’s party-state sees it as a threat to social stability.”An exodus of journalists has alarmed free speech advocates. Xue Lei quit his job two years ago as a reporter for the Beijing Youth Daily, a party newspaper, to work in public relations at a technology firm. He said he had grown tired of censorship orders and the pressure to produce clickbait instead of investigative pieces.“Issues that used to be covered a lot suddenly became restricted,” he said, pointing to stories about crime and corruption. “Sometimes you wouldn’t even know where a censorship order was coming from.”Economic considerations have also contributed to the disappearance of in-depth reporting. Many news outlets in China, like those elsewhere in the world, are struggling with steep losses in print advertising revenue and have eliminated investigative reporting teams, which typically require more time and resources and produce fewer stories.Uighur Muslim woman tells Congressional-Executive Commission on China she asked Chinese to kill her whilst in detention campAs traditional news outlets shed staff, the rise of online media in China once inspired optimism about the future of in-depth reporting. But Mr Xi’s campaign has also targeted online news outlets, with the government ordering many to close or shift away from critical reporting.Q Daily, a news site in Shanghai founded in 2014, was known for running feature stories on social issues, including problems facing rural migrants in big cities.But the authorities have repeatedly shut down Q Daily over the past year, including in late May. The government has accused it of illegally “conducting original reporting” and harming public opinion.Yang Ying, the website’s editor-in-chief, said the interference was crippling Q Daily’s business. The site has tried to abide by the government’s strict controls by avoiding sensitive topics like politics and the military. But she said it was often unclear what might anger the authorities.“There is no dignity running media here,” Ms Yang said.Before Mr Xi took control, Chinese journalism had entered something of a golden age, with reporters publishing investigations about faulty vaccines and shoddy buildings toppled by earthquakes.But under Mr Xi’s rule, harassment of journalists has worsened. At least 48 journalists were in prison in China as of December, more than in any other country, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.Experts warned that by reining in journalists, Mr Xi risked shutting off an important channel for the public to vent frustration.More than 35 countries defend China over detention of Uighur MuslimsFour Britons among foreigners arrested in China for drug offencesChina separating Muslim children from parents in ‘cultural genocide’China routinely installs secret surveillance app on tourists’ phonesChina harvesting organs from detainees, tribunal claims“Allowing the press some freedom would serve as a safety valve,” said Yuan Zeng, a media scholar at the University of Leeds.Despite the political climate, a small group of investigative journalists are fighting to keep their profession alive, publishing stories on social media and overseas outlets.Mr Liu, the journalist who was detained in 2013, continues to investigate serial killers and problems in the justice system, among other topics, often under a pen name.The best journalists in China are persistent and aware of the risks of the job, he said. “Outside of China, journalists are fired for writing false reports,” he said. “Inside China, they are fired for telling the truth.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He said investigators had located two ossuaries, or sets of bones, under a stone slab manhole covering inside the Teutonic college itself.He said the area was immediately sealed off and would be opened in the presence of forensic experts on 20 July.Mr Gisotti added that the bones were found in two holes carved out of a large stone that was covered by an old pavement stone a few metres behind the princesses\u0027 tombs. That area is now technically inside a building of the Teutonic College, after expansion work on the building encroached onto the cemetery field.Vatican digs up graves to try to solve mystery of missing girlThe last recorded structural work done on the building and the cemetery was in the 1960s and 1970s. Ms Orlandi disappeared in 1983.She vanished after leaving her family\u0027s Vatican City apartment to go to a music lesson in Rome. Her father was a lay employee of the Holy See.Her case has been one of the enduring mysteries of the Vatican, kept alive by the Italian media and a quest by her brother to find answers. Over the years, her disappearance has been linked to everything from the plot to kill St John Paul II to the financial scandal of the Vatican bank and Rome\u0027s criminal underworld.The last major twist in the case came in 2012, when Italian forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Ms Orlandi\u0027s remains as well. The search turned up no link.Last year, bones were found underneath the Vatican\u0027s embassy to Italy in Rome. Italian media immediately speculated the remains could belong to Ms Orlandi or another girl who went missing at around the same time. But forensic tests showed the bones long predated their disappearances.Pietro Orlandi, the missing girl\u0027s brother, has long demanded the Vatican give the family full access to all information it has about his sister\u0027s disappearance.The family\u0027s lawyer, Laura Sgro, said on Saturday she had been informed of the discovery of the bones and that the family was pleased that the investigation was continuing.Vatican to open centuries-old tombs in bid to find missing girlVatican to open archives on pope accused of silence on HolocaustVatican not taking action over cardinal who molested choirboysHuman remains found at Vatican embassy could solve 35-year-old mysteryVatican clarifies Pope\u0027s comments on psychiatric help for gay childrenOur interest is to actively cooperate with Vatican prosecutors to understand better how those two tombs could have been empty, she said in a statement. If we understand together, it\u0027s better.In 2017, an Italian investigative journalist caused a sensation when he published a five-page document that had been stolen from a locked Vatican cabinet that suggested the Holy See had been involved in Ms Orlandi\u0027s disappearance. The Vatican immediately branded the document a fake, though it never explained what it was doing in the Vatican cabinet.The document was purportedly written by a cardinal and listed supposed expenses used for Ms Orlandi\u0027s upkeep after she disappeared.Mr Gisotti said this week that the Holy See has always shown attention and closeness to the suffering of the Orlandi family and in particular Emanuela\u0027s mother and that its decision to excavate the Teutonic cemetery at the family\u0027s request was evidence of that attention.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A\u0026nbspvery rich area of hidden tombs.”The\u0026nbsppyramid marked a key step in the evolution of pyramid construction. Its angular shape contrasts with the straight sides of Sneferu’s Red Pyramid just to the north – the first of ancient Egypt’s fully-formed pyramids and the next step towards the Great Pyramid of Giza.Architects changed the angle when cracks started appearing in the structure, according to Mr Waziri.Mohamed Shiha, director of the Dahshur site, said: “Sneferu lived a very long time ... the architects wanted to reach the complete shape, the pyramid shape.“Exactly where he was buried, we are not sure of that.

There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us,\u0027 says Mounir BaatourClick to followThe IndependentMounir Baatour’s office is cool, the steady thrum of the air conditioner offering a welcome break from the blistering summer heat that has descended upon Tunis. Past noon, little moves outside. The streets are empty and even the city’s ubiquitous cat population has slinked off to the shadows.Despite the temperature, Baatour, the first openly gay man to run for president in a Muslim country, remains focused upon the task ahead.The road leading to the November poll is unlikely to offer a smooth ride. Homosexuality itself isn’t illegal in Tunisia. However, practising it is. This distinction has allowed Baatour, a lawyer, to register the pressure group\u0026nbspShams. Along with others, the group campaigns for a repeal of the colonial French\u0026nbsplaw\u0026nbspproscribing sodomy.Likewise, legal\u0026nbsprestrictions criminalising\u0026nbsp”outrages against public decency” are often used to persecute the country’s LGBT+ population – these\u0026nbspremain firmly with the sights of Baatour and other rights campaigners. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOn top of this, the police force appears eager to exploit existing edicts allowing, for instance,\u0026nbspenforced anal examinations to be used as evidence of sexuality. This is buttressed by a judiciary and political establishment long practised in the art of looking the other way.Created with Sketch.Best photos from Pride 2019 around the world Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In February, a young man from the coastal city of Sfax received an eight month\u0026nbspsentence for engaging in homosexual acts after reporting being raped by two other men. Other stories of official abuse are legion. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I am openly gay,”\u0026nbspBaatour\u0026nbspsays. “I came out 20 years ago. I was jailed for three months for sodomy in 2013. There’s no shame for me. There’s no shame for any of us.”Baatour, his association and his relatively fringe Liberal party are children of Tunisia’s revolution. In the years immediately following 2011, a number of gay rights groups emerged, led by Baatour’s own Shams, calling for a repeal of\u0026nbspanti-homosexual laws.However, even here, Shams’ tactics have given rise to ision, with a coalition for LGBT+ rights issuing a statement\u0026nbsplast year distancing themselves from Shams and its president. Baatour attributes this schism to his openness to potentially normalising relations with Israel, a suggestion considered anathema to many on Tunisia’s left.Perhaps ironically, the same period during which many of these groups arose also witnessed an explosion in Islamism across Tunisia, with the moderate Islamist Ennahda party vying with the radical\u0026nbspAnsar al-Sharia\u0026nbspfor the political souls of Tunisia’s religious majority.When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No\u0026nbspAnsar\u0026nbspal-Sharia was outlawed in 2013, and support for Ennahda appears to have ebbed since the groundswell of popular support that saw them achieve a plurality vote in the country’s first free elections in 2011.But across many sections of Tunisian society, values typically bend towards the traditional. In August, conservative demonstrators of both genders took to the street to protest a\u0026nbsppresidentially mandated report\u0026nbspurging greater inidual freedoms and equality across the genders. \u0026nbspAs far as homosexuality is concerned, those conservative sentiments cut deeper. A June 2019 survey by the polling institute Arab Barometer reported that just 7 per cent of Tunisians condoned homosexuality. It’s a sentiment reflected within the rhetoric of some of Baatour’s populist rivals for the presidency. Law professor Kais Saied\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa close second in the polls – he has\u0026nbspsuggested\u0026nbspthat encouraging the spread of homosexuality within the country is a foreign plot. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAlleged rape victim imprisoned for homosexual acts by Tunisian court“I think we need to have a debate about homosexuality in Tunisia,” says Baatour, who identifies as Muslim but doesn’t practise.“I’m not talking about promoting homosexuality, just about decriminalising it. Gay people don’t do anyone any harm. They should be free to do what they want with their bodies. If, as Kais Saied has said, homosexuality is a sickness, then – even if I accept that – I have to ask, why are you putting sick people in jail?“When you put gay people in jail for three years, what, do they come out straight? No. So they must return to jail for a further three years and then for the rest of their lives.”Though what Baatour is proposing might seem radical, it is not without precedent. In arguing his case, Baatour points to the country’s first post-independence president, Habib Bourguiba, who in 1956 introduced landmark laws outlawing polygamy and introducing a code of women’s rights that stands to this day.LGBT activists arrested at unauthorised pride march in Cuba“All of that at the time was controversial, a lot of people said it was against Islam. However, Bourguiba had the political will to impose it. In 1956, Tunisia was more conservative than it is now, but people came to accept it and still do.” \u0026nbspHowever, while accepting that much of the attention on him focuses upon his stance on LGBT+ rights, Baatour is keen to stress that his candidacy is about more.He wants to address many of Tunisia’s underlying ills, from the state enterprises that continue to haemorrhage money, to the vast scale of the country’s informal economy, to the environment, which remains a priority.But above all, he says, is his commitment to promoting civil liberties and the rights of the inidual.Whether or not he is successful remains to be seen. However, for Baatour, the fight alone is worthwhile. If anything, he says, his campaign forces the other candidates to address the lack of progress on civil liberties and inidual rights within Tunisia.Baatour leans forward, “I will place this at the very heart of my campaign.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But in  the CIA officially acknowledged its existence and its location was revealed.Declassied documents reveal it was originally somewhere for the Army Air Corp pilots to practise their aerial gunnery.During the Cold War experimental aircraft and weapons systems were tested here.This included the high altitude U- spy plane.Its current use is unknown and remains a top secret.The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.In July  the military sensationally announced in a press release it had found the remains of a crashed flying saucer in the desert.But the following day it retracted the statement, saying it was in fact a damaged US Air Force air balloon.Yet as reported, Sherf Jess Slaughter and Deputy Sherf Charles Fogus were on duty in a patrol car on the night of the alleged incident. Suddenly they heard reports of a crashed aircraft on their police radio.In the interview Mr Fogus claims he saw a flying saucer smash into the side of a river bed and that the flying object was “ft across”.Describing the scene, he said: “When we got there, the land was covered with soldiers. They were hauling a big, creature.“The bodies must have been  feet tall.“I saw the legs and feet on some of them. They looked like our feet.”The exact purpose of the air base is not known publicly, and the area is heavily restricted.Trespassers can face huge fines and y prison sentences for setting foot in the zone.Purchased by the US government in , evidence suggests the site is used as a testing area for experimental aircraft and weapons.But the secrecy surrounding it has led conspiracy theorists to suggest the area is holding extra-terrestrial secrets.Theories suggest engineers examine crashed spacecrafts — and even hold meetings with aliens from across the galaxy.The crash of a weather balloon at Roswell, New Mexico in  sparked wild theories of an alien ship crash.Some have suggested Area  is still storing parts of the crashed ship — or even its alien inhabitants. As well as assessing alien technology it is often suggested that it is a place where meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials occur.Other theories suggest it has served as a research site for a range of exotic weapons and technologies.This includes the development of time travel or teleportation technologyAnother theory is that the much rumoured Aurora stealth plane is being tested here.The most outlandish idea is that Area  is a base for a one world government.More than , people have joined a Facebook group saying they intend to storm Area   on September , .The organisers - with their tongues firmly in their cheeks - created the page Storm Area , They Cant Stop All of Us, calling for people to storm the location between am and am on the day.The page adds: We can move faster then their bullets.Organisers of the event are planning to start a “Naruto run,” as they approach the site, a term which refers to a Japanese anime style of running with the arms thrust backward and the head stretched forward.The page, in deadpan style, says: Lets see them aliens.Although the identity of the person who made the original post has not been revealed, they wrote on the pinned post: Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.Im not responsiblepeople decide to actually storm area .The US Air Force though has issued a strong warning to anyone actually thinking of trying to storm the site.Air Force spokesperson Laura McAndrews has released a warning to potential trespassers.“[Area ] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces.“The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government. Or one of his and Corbyn’s proteges.It could well be the end of the party as a viable political force full-stop.Ah well. Time to say goodbye to Jezza. It was fun while it lasted, mate. In a really grim kind of way.GRIM viewing, wasn’t it  That leadership debate.Smirky Hunt trying to convince everyone he has charisma and stands a chance of winning. And our next Prime Minister, Bozo, incapable of giving a straight answer to anything.Can you imagine asking Boris the time “Well, ha ha, I think that’s a very interesting question. And some people may be prepared to tell you it’s eleven o’clock, or perhaps five to five. But I’m not going to do that. No. Not me. That’s for others to say.“I will tell you, beyond all doubt, that it is definitely not seven o’clock, and that’s the important thing, the thing voters care about. And that’s why I think I should be your Prime Minister. Because I will never tell the electorate it is seven o’clock when it isn’t. And, indeed, even when it is.“Does that answer your question, Julie ”GOOD – he’s gone. Sir Kim Darroch, our ambassador to the US.Caught out when leaked messages revealed he thinks Donald Trump is “inept” and the White House dysal.He had to go, evenhe has become a darling of the liberal establishment here for hating Trump.Here’s a suggestion. How about we get as his replacement someone who understands Trump and Trump’s appeal to US voters DO you really think Boris Johnson is going to get us out of the European Union  Properly, I mean, much as we voted for If so, pass the hallucinogens. I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders. You can read about how Brexit was betrayed in my new book, The Great Betrayal, out next week.It’s a sorry story and it should make you angry. Mind you, it’s also quite funny,you have a warped sense of humour.THIS is Geronimo the alpaca. Take a good look at him because he’s not going to be around much longer.The Government has decided he must be slaughtered because, according to a possibly flawed report, he carries a strain of bovine tuberculosis. His owner, Helen Macdonald, is utterly distraught.The killing of Geronimo, and the wholesale slaughter of our badgers, has been forced on the Government by the farmers. They have way too much power.They create sterile landscapes on vast subsidies.It’s time for all this to stop. For our sake, as well as Geronimo’s.HAVE we ever had a member of the Royal Family who was smugger, more full of herself, more truly bloody irritating, than Meghan OK, King John was a bit of a t***er . . . but things were dferent in the th century.

But at least she wasn’t a hypocrite.Meghan is insufferably woke – forever bleating about social-justice “ishoos” but happy to swan around in a private jet and have us pay millions for her cottage in Windsor.Now she’s decided she doesn’t like people taking pics of her when she’s on another freebie to Wimbledon.Get real, love, before you alienate the entire British public . . . instead of just chippy little monkeys like me.Or: “We had fizzy pop delivered.”More pertinently, “I have six teeth left,” or: “I remember hating Leeds United even before Don Revie arrived.”But that’s ten words and thus inadmissible.I SEE that Nicki Minaj has cancelled her concert in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Everyone told her it’s a foul country where they don’t treat women especially well.But she seemed determined to push on.My worry is thatNicki dressed on stage the way she usually dresses on stage, she’d be on permanent display in Saudi, with her head on top of a pole. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wasnt rude, or displaying threatening body language, or even drunk and starting fights, he said.There was no breaking of glassware on my part, no puking, no p***ing or drawing on the wall. No.Simply by being there, in their proximity and doing nothing, I was creepy and for that I got banned from The Polar Bear completely out of the blue, with no warning whatsoever.I used to be treated as a VIP there while I was offering them professional photography work for free, but then I stopped doing that and I was instantly demoted to tolerated.But in the long run, middle aged foreign male creeps who do nothing cant be tolerated forever, can they Its really upsetting - I feel hurt and have friends that always go there that I wont be able to see.According to their Facebook page, The Polar Bear has been going since the s and claims to have represented every facet of Hulls unique nightle at some point during its letime.The Polar Bear describe themselves as A unique venue set within the surroundings of a traditional boozer, and  a hub for Hull’s creative types boasting an enviable roster of DJ’s each with monthly offerings provide a erse range of nights to suit all music tastes.The Sun Online has contacted The Polar Bear for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"mps lords houses in order karren brady","story":"Nearly two years on from #MeToo, two new reports paint a bleak picture of sexual harassment in Westminster.The first report, about the House of Lords, found that one in five peers was considered to behave in an inappropriate or high-handed way to staff. One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news.

He said many big stores rarely call police as the force is so stretched.Instead, the detectives working for the flagship stores use citizen’s arrest powers to detain dippers. They then record details from their ID cards, take their mug shots and issue le-time store bans.The experienced private detective, who did not want to be named, said: “We do call the police sometimes. If the dipper has thousands of pounds on them we’ll flag it as important but it can still take up to four hours for the police to turn up.”The investigator said the women compete with one another to be the best and have their own league table “similar to the Premier League”.A thief calling herself Diana the Express is currently No. in the world based on her hauls. Another group has been dubbed the Spice Girls, because they always operate in a group of five.The detective added: “One is Scary, one is Baby but the others are known as Old Spice, Chubby Spice and Pretty Spice because it best fits their descriptions.“Dippers bounce from city to city once their cover has been blown and move all over the country. Only the best come to Oxford Street. It’s basically the equivalent of playing in a Champions League final at Wembley.“When they’ve got enough they go home to their huge houses. I’ve seen pictures on their phones. They live in mansions with marble floors and marble beds.”The women are reported to be from the Plov, Sofia and Varna areas in Bulgaria and Bucharest, in Romania. The private investigator said they first began arriving in London in around  when EU rules on movement were eased.Initially, most carried only their Bulgarian or Romanian ID cards but since the Brexit poll many have UK driving licences as they think it will help them re-enter the UK. On world-famous Oxford Street, he said, their favourite places are Harrods, Selfridges or bureau de change desks.Lting the lid on their daily le, he said: “They work quite civilised hours. They start when shops get busy, so any time from am really. They have lunch in McDonald’s at around pm.“Their witching hours are between pm and pm. We don’t have enough manpower to detain or deter them all during those hours as they’re all over the place.“If we see a pair they will Romanian. If they are in larger groups they are generally Bulgarian. We tend to stick with the ones we are following andwe see others we hope to pick them up later.He said the thieves wear designer sunglasses and expensive handbags to blend in with their wealthy intended victims. “We recognise them straight away. They dress up but wear trainers so they can move quickly.”Many wear headscarves to try to hide their identity. He went on: “They’re very aware of us. We’ve detained most of them before so they often recognise us. We often work in pairs so it’s more dficult for them to spot us.”Describing their techniques, he added: “They’ll pick up a victim but don’t speak to each other. They float around the shops.

Another video recorded on a camera left in an unattended room picks up a knocking noise and the same voice saying release. Mr Moss said: Hearing it say it wanted to burn my eyes was terrying at the time and to have members of the public along with us who witnessed it was just crazy. What is also signicant is that a few years ago we also captured a voice saying something along the lines of reap your eyes and a number of people have had the sensation of their eyes burning but we never thought too much of it until this incident. We believe this doll gained its attachment in Ruthin and over the last few months we have recorded some good evidence including knocking sounds and the same voice several times which has been captured and heard in real time.  Weaposve had knocking sounds and a voice saying release me which was captured on the box and the camera shows nobody  was in the room.

The supernatural horror film is inspired by the story of a raggedy Anne doll which was given to a student nurse in America in the s.

Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have since died, were called in to help and the doll is now kept in a glass box at the Warrenaposs Occult Museum in Connecticut. Mr Moss said: Some people may compare it to the doll Annabelle from the films. Hollywood have dramatised the Annabelle a lot and things are dferent in real le. Things donapost go flying around the room and people donapost get possessed like you see in the films. People may be skeptical and say our Grace doll findings are fake but we have caught them in real time and Iaposll admit even I was never a big believer but this item is just amazing. Iaposve never seen anything like it. Without a doubt it is the most haunted item in the UK. A lot of people have experienced it.

Richard, a primary school teacher, says it initially appeared Michael was on the mend after his gruelling  hour surgery, overcoming temporary paralysis and recovering his strength. But circumstances changed around seven weeks later. Richard said: He just started being a bit dferent. He could not move anymore and he became paralysed again. It slowly got worse and worse.  Doctors realised Michael was suffering from hydrocephalus, a build up of fluid filling the cavity where the tumour had been removed from his brain stem, which controls multiple vital bodily s.  Richard said: Every time the pressure built up on his brain he would become paralysed and he would lose more and more movement until the point he was just not conscious. Twice he nearly died they didnapost think he was going to make it through the night. As recently as January all he could do on a good day was twiddle a finger - he was trapped in his own body.

He said: Itaposs been absolute hell. The first six months when I was off work it was just awful. If I didnapost have the support from my work I donapost think I would have lasted half as long.

Gurvinder Gill, the mother of -year-old Calum, said her le has never been the same since the death of her intelligent and handsome son on May , . A University of Hull law student, Calum was on a bus ride to Radio One Big Weekend when he developed a horrid grey pallor on board the bus and was moaning without making sense. The bus was stopped and an off-duty nurse tried to help him before an ambulance arrived. He later died in Hull Royal Infirmary surrounded by his family.  Facing Connor Tyler-Treanor, , who has been jailed for three years after he was found to have supplied drugs to the student, Ms Gill said her son was an intelligent, talented, handsome, and loving child. The pain of losing my son Calum is indescribable. I spend my le now wishing I was dead, hoping that when I go to bed at night I donapost wake up in the morning. You see I also died on the th May because I have no future, as this has been stolen from me along with any dreams or hopes I had for this family.Police investigating the tragedy discovered Tyler-Treanor - using the pseudonym Saul - and another unidentied man had set themselves up as drug dealers deliberately targeting students in the city,  Hull Crown Court  heard. Tyler-Treanor was not prosecuted on the basis he had supplied the fatal drugs, but sentencing judge Recorder Caroline Goodwin QC said Calumaposs death was an aggravating feature of the case, Hull Daily Mail reports.   In the harrowing victim statement read out to the court on Friday, Mrs Gill Gurvinder revealed how Calum had only finished his final exams the previous day. He planned to work as a leguard in an American summer camp before teaching at an English language school in China. She also spoke about how her family had moved out of the home they had been in for the past  years because of all the memories, and that she could no longer work in the finance sector despite decades of experience. But she nonetheless said she will strive to pull together for her other son, who is  years old.  Prosecutor Phillip Evans said when police searched Calumaposs accommodation, they found a typed note in the kitchen advertising the sale of drugs, which said MDMA, Molly, Mandy. It was said to be  per cent pure, was offered in  quantities of up to two grams, and had a price list.  The note also offered made to order bombs costing between £ and £. A delivery service was also advertised to areas of the city heavily populated with students. A telephone number under the name Saul was also given.That number led police to Tyler-Treanoraposs address, who initially tried to evade officers to dump cannabis in some foliage. But he quickly realised the futility of his actions and showed police what turned out to be  grams of cannabis.  Police found further cannabis inside the property worth a total of £.. Tyler-Treanor was arrested and further drugs paraphernalia was seized, including grip-seal bags, a grinder, a list of numbers, scales, and mobile phones. An expert drugs officer analysed messages on the phones and found a conversation between Calum and Saul, in which Calum was trying to acquire MDMA for the forthcoming Radio One event, Mr Evans said.

The lunar-tics who say the Apollo  landing was all a hoax – staged in a Hollywood Studio to distract from the ­unpopular Vietnam war, boost America’s esteem and stuff it up the Soviets. Because that footage watched by  million people around the world ­really was incredible. The lunar module looked like it was made of Meccano and the bouncing astronauts could have been Thunderbirds figures. And that iconic image of Armstrong’s first ­footprint in the dust – was it faked as the doubters say  Of course not, because ALL the ­conspiracy theories have been debunked countless times. Yet,  years later,  per cent of Americans and millions of other earthlings still believe it was a massive con. Even though the computers, tablets and mobiles they share their theories on couldn’t existman hadn’t landed on the moon. Even though their cordless vacs, LED lights, memory foam mattresses, cushioned trainers, power tools, Alexa, Instagram ­images and much more would never have been invented without the giant leaps of Nasa science. But there is real tragedy in denying the truth of the moon landing.   It is also denying the joy of knowledge, the wonder of discovery and the power of beauty.And it squanders the unying power of shared humanity and awe at the cosmos which swept the globe when Armstrong set foot on the powdery surface on July , .Don’t we need that more than ever today  In  when JFK made his famous “we chose to go to the moon” speech he said this: “We set sail on this new sea because there is new ­knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won. And they must be won and used for the progress of all people.” Astronauts who have looked back at our Earth from the surface of the moon talk of the overview effect – the sense of the sense of the futility of wars and national conflicts and how vital it is to protect our own planet. As one Russian cosmonaut said: “It isn’t important in which sea or lake you observe a slick of pollution or in which country a fire in the forest breaks out. You are standing guard over the whole of our Earth.” Armstrong and Aldrin’s footprints are still up there on the surface of the moon as there is no wind to blow them away. And we must never allow the conspiracy theorists to trample on their legacy. I say bra-vo to Stella for not washing every stitch    People got their knickers in a knot this week when fashion designer Stella McCartney revealed she rarely washes her bras. She hates washing ANY clothes, actually, and would never clean a suit but “let the dirt dry and brush it off”. “Eugh!” went the youngsters who can’t go anywhere without anti-bac and throw their togs in the machine – sorry, on the floor next to the washing basket – after a few hours wear. But eco-conscious Stella is quite right. We’ve become paranoid about dirt, wound-up by TV and internet cleaning gurus who make a fortune plugging products. But one machine wash can release nine million plastic microfibres into our rivers and oceans, damaging wildle. If you’re “clean in your habits” – as my nan used to say – and wash yourself every day there’s no need to overload the Hotpoint. So, like Stella’s bras, I support her fully.I did like to be beside the seaside I had a lovely time on the beach at Weymouth the other day. It was the first time I’d visited the Dorset resort since my ninth birthday in , so I expected it to have changed beyond recognition. Especially as it’s now one of the most-Instagrammed seaside resorts in the UK.    I thought – and feared, to be honest – that it would be all cocktails, bistros and fake-tanned Love Island types in their designer cozzies. But I was thrilled to discover that it has hardly changed, with plenty of cream teas, fish and chip shops and sunburned blokes with big bellies in too-small Speedos. The BBs are a bit pricier of course, but Weymouth still has all the joys of the traditional British seaside. And the lack of pink, fur-trimmed Kiss Me Quick hats, rude rock and willy-shaped inflatables prove it’s yet to be ruined by the stag and hen do hordes.Lying tuckers Men who have had facelts appear more honest to women, according to new research. Experts at a US university found blokes who had nips and tucks to knock a few years off got the benefit of appearing more trustworthy too. I bet plastic surgeons start doing BOGOF deals now. For all those two-faced b******s.    Iaposll veer off the Vermouth When I first started going out-out as a teenager in the s my favourite drink was Cinzano and lemonade. It was the height of sophistication, plugged on TV by the glam Joan Collins who’d always get a cleavage-full thanks to her bumbling beau Leonard Rossiter. “Getting your head down, sweetie  Jolly good idea.” I was also partial to a Martini Rosso, advertised by that racy roller skating waitress and the innuendo-laced slogan: “Any time, any place, anywhere.”  They’re unlikely to resurrect either of those ads but it seems vermouth, the spirit in both drinks, is the trendy new tipple. Specialist bars are popping up around the country and Instagram influencers are posting pictures of themselves sipping vermouth over ice with soda or tonic in all sorts of exotic locations. I can’t touch the stuff now, though. A night on Cinzano and Martini in  wasn’t a jolly good idea and resulted in me getting my head down with the world’s worst hangover. So I won’t be raising a glass of vermouth – any time, any place or anywhere. Iaposd get the bird on the dancefloor Snowball the head-banging cockatoo has worried me for years. I laughed myself silly at videos of him bopping to Queen, Cyndi Lauper and the Backstreet Boys, posted online by his US owner. Until some bird fans said his dancing was a distress display, brought on by over-loud music.  But university experts in Massachusetts have studied Snowball closely and concluded that he is, truly, a feathered Fred Astaire with  separate dance moves to match dferent rhythms. It indicates “he has circuits in the brain for processing beats similar to our own”. Eh   moves  They clearly haven’t seen my distressing displays on the dance floor.

To me, the way people talked about retirement felt like it was the only reason to work, aswork itself was a punishment. Then you’d be rewarded with days filled with doing the things you loved – golf, cruises, gardening, travelling, lie-ins. It did sound idyllic back then. Now, not so much. Hubby Steve and I have never had a retirement conversation and we don’t even think about a day when we won’t work. Maybe that is because we are self-employed, so we are more in control of when we want to work and how often. We also love what we do. Don’t get me wrong – with any work there are ups and downs, and beingself-employed is very risky: there are no paid sick days, holiday or ­maternity cover. Ultimately, you get out what you put in.But the thought of not working does not sit well. Working, in whatever capacity, has given me a sense of purpose.

The German chef, one of only two non-French people to work at the glamorous hotelaposs kitchens, once attempted to smuggle a box of crab cakes, foie gras and smoked salmon into jail to treat mate disgraced Tory MP Jeffrey Archer.

This would be something you would expect to see at The Savoy. They [the chefs] were impressed two-fold with Miller and Carteraposs story, that all the meat is traceable, and the quality is second to none, Andrew Green, chief executive of Guild of Chefs, told . Anton Edelmann was executive chef at The Savoy for years. Andrew Bennett, who worked with him, was executive chef at Park Lane Hotel.  It will remain for three years, the only place in the UK to have it.    We are excited to be working with Miller  Carter on its exceptional steak range. After having the chance to explore every aspect of these first-class steaks, from the way the cattle are reared, to how the steaks are butchered, aged and cooked to perfection, we have awarded them our ‘Masters of Steak’ accreditation. The steps the company takes is testament to its passion and devotion for offering guests an indulgent steak experience. Mystery diners will now visit all branches of the premium chain, which has its headquarters in Muswell Hill, north London, to assess the quality each month.  Hannah Phillips, marketing boss for the steak chain, said: It was a long process, over a year, to get to the accreditation. We are very passionate that this accreditation has to stand for the up most quality, at all times, no compromises. By working with a small number of abattoirs located across these regions, it helps minimise cattle transportation times and ensures we meet our field to fork commitments. We have in depth classroom sessions, we then take participants [chefs and general managers] to a farm to see the cows, understand what their diet consists of. We also visit the abattoir to understand the tight specication that a Miller  Carter steak has to adhere to, along with learning about the ageing process and seeing a live demonstration of our master butchers at work, cutting every single steak, by hand.

Tammie Mylan and her husband Richardaposs elation following the test left them enthusiastically looking forward to the  week scan.When they arrived at hospital they suddenly had to put the brakes on their plans for the future however, Wales Online reported.An ultrasound revealed there was no baby but a deadly and rare form of cancer that mimics the symptoms of a pregnancy. What they thought was their precious bump was choriocarcinoma, a fast growing le threatening cancer that begins in what would have been the placenta.    The body reacts to the invasive condition by producing pregnancy hormones, leading the couple - who met seven years before when they were working on TV drama Waterloo Road - to believe a baby was on the way. The -year-old said: “When I had the scan they discovered no baby had grown. I was about three months apospregnantapos. “Coming up for that first scan I had felt fine but when I turned up it wasn’t fine and they told me something wasn’t right.” Medics told the shocked couple that Tammie had choriocarcinoma, a type of persistent trophoblastic, very rare pregnancy-related tumours. When she thought she would be doing baby checks she was instead undergoing surgery at the University Hospital of Wales before being transferred to Charing Cross Hospital.    The London based hospital is a world leader in pregnancy related tumours and treats around  cases a year. Tammie says doctors there saved her le. When doctors were unable to do more surgery on her, they put her on a gruelling course of chemotherapy. Every two weeks for eight months she had to go in to hospital for treatment. “I just had to get through it. Richard was a constant support and came with me to all my appointments,” said Tammie, who is originally from Dundee. When she was diagnosed Tammie was in her final year of a nursing degree at the University of South Wales.    “I tried to focus on getting on with my degree, she said. I couldn’t do my nursing placement so I did my dissertation. That really helped because it gave me focus on something that wasn’t chemotherapy.” On Friday she graduated with Richard and her mum and dad Diane and Mark by her side.

The couple plan to try for a baby again. “Having children was just something I always presumed would happen, she said.    I could not imagine not doing it. “It has reduced my chances but doctors say I can have a family.

Celebration was once hailed as the ultimate dream town for Disney aficionados where they could escape to their very own fantasy land. Around billion was invested by The Walt Disney Company into developing it on the outskirts of Disney World in Florida  years ago. And envious homes - painted white, yellow, pink, tan or blue - and its lush green gardens, bordered by white picket fences, lined the streets. In autumn, the town used to import fallen leaves to waft around, and in winter fake snow was put on rooftops. While trees were fitted with speakers playing never-ending bird song.    It appeared to be every inch “The Happiest Place on Earth”. The town soon expanded and became equipped for , with a hospital and school nearby. Residents even referred to it as aposThe Bubbleapos because it was like living in a separate universe. While some compared it to something out of the Stepford Wives film.But cracks soon began to show with aposdodgyapos buildings, strict rules, a dysal and weird school - and death, reports News .Celebration might have been many things, but it was not a Disney theme park. It was a real town with real problems, said historical writer LJ Charlston. Plans for the town were first announced in . Demand was so high that the company asked people to enter a lottery to be in with a chance of snapping up one of the  homes. Around , people entered longing for a piece of perfection.  The original sales brochure boasted: There once was a place where neighbours greeted neighbours in the quiet of summer twilight. Where children chased fireflies. And porch swings provided easy refuge from the cares of the day. The movie house showed cartoons on Saturday. The grocery store delivered. And there was one teacher who always knew you had that special something. Remember that place  But as residents came and went complaints of the painfully contrived ­prettiness and physical ­perfection began to emergeIt was claimed that every house had to have a Mickey Mouse hidden somewhere in the property - just one rule in the -page regulations book that residents were said to have been expected to follow.Only certain plants were reportedly allowed in gardens, and special lanes were built behind homes to hide cars and rubbish bins. While residents are said to have only been allowed to have certain coloured curtains and had to keep their manicured lawns at a specic height.Residents Ory and Jan Schiesel, a retired ­couple from Michigan, told the Daily Mail in : If you don’t like rules, you don’t want to live here.They said no two adjoining houses could look alike, no home could have more than two cars on the street, while the blinds or curtains had to be white on the outside.  Mr Schiesel added: Technically,you don’t have enough bark in your ground cover or you have dead plants in your porch, they’ll send you a letter. As the years passed, there were also complaints of leaking roofs and other issues with the properties.An inquiry set up to investigate found that at least  homes needed new roofs.The school also came under fire with classrooms supposedly rammed with  children between three teachers. Many families chose to sell their homes and move away over the “serious academic shortcomings.” But more sinister things were to come. In , the town was rocked by an armed home invasion. A couple were bound and gagged in their home by a gang of masked burglars. Then in November , resident Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, , who lived alone with his Chihuahua, Lucy, was strangled with a shoelace and bludgeoned to death with an axe.    The alarm was raised by neighbours who called police after they had not seen the teacher for several days. Police then made the grisly discovery. David Israel Zenon Murillo, who was  and homeless at the time, received a le sentence for the murder. He told police he flew into a rage after Mr Giovanditto tried to sexually assault him. After the slaying, former pupils of Mr Giovanditto came forward and claimed he had molested them and invited them to sleepovers at his house.An anonymous mother alleged to The Daily Beast  that Mr Giovanditto - who she has described as a aposcunning paedophile predatorapos - developed a close relationship with her -year-old son.She claimed he treated him to trips abroad to countries including Mexico, Japan and China. But the boy suddenly cut all ties with Mr Giovanditto at the age of  and she alleged she later learned her sonaposs aposmentorapos had been sexually abusing him for years. Days after Mr Giovandittoaposs death, a man named Craig Foushee, , also a Celebration resident, barricaded himself in his own house for  hours. He began shooting at police officers outside. None were injured, but when they entered the house they found Mr Foushee dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  The former airline pilot was said to have been deeply depressed following his orce, loss of home and the failure of his security business. Meanwhile, there was also talk of a aposdeath pondapos near the idyllic town with the cookie-cutter homes. Up until  there was no warnings on the road that,you took a wrong turn, you risked driving into the water. There were several incidents that gave the pond its macabre name. The most well-known involved three young men who’d been holidaying in Florida in the summer of  before they mysteriously vanished. Their bodies were discovered nine months later inside a car at the bottom of the lake. Malcolm Longley, a property investor who moved to Celebration from Maidenhead, also claimed there was a seedy side to Celebration with aposwe-swappingapos being re. He said in : We call it Celebration Separation. Pretty much all the British people I know who have moved here have come happily married and ended up orced. It’s an incestuous town, and there’s an element of we-swapping.    I’d never met swingers that much until I came here. Gavin Todd admitted that he had seen some move to Celebration to hide away from problems and find some fairytale ending, but they don’t get it. Disney sold Celebration in  to a New York company. Some residents have since rallied behind their town and hit out at the creepy image it has been portrayed as.Responding to a blog post, one said: I have lived in Celebration for nine years and I love it. The best part of Celebration is the wonderful and caring people.Another added: I absolutely love living in Celebration. It is not creepy at all. Everyone is really friendly and it is beautul.

Although the storm was downgraded from a hurricane, Barry has still been causing chaos since it made landfall in Louisiana tonight.Residents have been ordered not to travel unless absolutely necessary, with tornado warnings issued by local authorities.About  people living along a Louisiana highway have been ordered to evacuate their homes, after multiple reports of levees overtopping in the parishes of Terrebonne and Plaquemines. And all of Morgan City - home to more than , people - is currently without power, according to nola.    State Police posted on Twitter to reminded people not to travel unless absolutely necessary. The post read: As night falls and the severe weather continues across Louisiana, Troopers are stressing to drivers not to travel unless absolutely necessary. Remember to watch for downed trees and power lines. One should always assume that a fallen power line is live. New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lafayette areas are expected to feel the effects of Barry late into Saturday night through Sunday, according to the latest forecast. National Weather Service New Orleans  issued a tornado warning until .pm local time as a band of heavy rain battered the region. The National Hurricane Center, which had labelled Barry the first Atlantic hurricane of  just hours earlier, said the storm came ashore near Intracoastal City in Louisiana with mph winds. The NHC expects a further weakening to a tropical depression on Sunday as Barry moves inland at around mph.    Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned residents not to take the storm lightly, but adding that the state and levees in New Orleans were ready for impact and should withstand the floodwaters. He wrote in a post on Twitter Saturday: There have been NO levee failures in Plaquemines Parish. There are isolated issues of flooding that state and local officials anticipated and are actively addressing.    Becky Broussard, homeland security director for Vermilion Parish, said the lone road leading to the town had flooded as Barry made landfall at Intracoastal City on late Saturday morning, it is reported. She said: Weaposre still not out of the woods yet. She added the parish is moving all emergency vehicles, including  fire engines, to higher ground to ensure theyaposre safe from flooding. The Mississippi River crested on Friday night in New Orleans at just under ft , the National Weather Service said, much lower than a prediction earlier this week of  feet , near the height of the cityaposs levees. The river was expected to surge again to about ft on Monday, the weather service said. Streets and businesses were flooded along Lake Pontchartrain in Mandeville, just north of New Orleans, according to a Reuters witness.

Yakutsk, in Siberia, is sweltering in C heat. It is a far cry from the heights of winter, when it can drop to dangerously low temperatures. Yakutsk is built on permafrost in eastern Russia, but is bizarrely hotter than Yemen. The unusual heat wave in vast diamond-rich Yakutia region, with straddles the Arctic, sent locals scurrying to the “world’s most unusual beach” - a glacier, to chill on the ice. This “hidden gem” lies in a deep valley some  miles south of Yakutsk surrounded by pristine pine forests and lush green meadows.    Others dashed to the closer city beach on the Lena River which just three months ago was rock solid with ice so thick that heavily-laden lorries use it as a winter roadway. But colourful Buluus glacier - almost four square miles in size - proved more refreshing, according to locals. ‘This is for real, your eyes are not failing you, it’s ice,’ wrote local woman Zhanna Myasnikova as she shared pictures of herself enjoying the refreshing day at the glacier. ‘The Buluus glacier is a fantastic place to be in the middle of summer when the air heats to over C.    ‘By the end of summer the ice melts a bit, but comes winter and it gains strength again. ‘This is a thousand-year long fight between ice and fire.’ Another local called Aitalina posted: Where  would you find a place with so many contrasts  “The feeling of breathing cold air, touching chilly ice and drinking amazingly tasty cold water from the glacier on such a hot day is unforgettable.” Yakutia - officially known as the Sakha Republic - covers a swathe of Siberia and geographically is almost as large as India.

Europa League home defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi, the duo committed their long-term future to Aberdeen until summer .Having been appointed Pittodrie manager in March  McInnes is the second longest serving manager in Scottish senior football, second only to Peterhead’s Jim McInally.He has rejected approaches from both Sunderland and Rangers to manage them during his time in the Granite City.However, it remains a source of frustration to McInnes that he has yet to add to the League Cup trophy secured in .McInnes said: “Aberdeen is a club I have grown to love and I continue to love.“On my first day at Pittodrie I talked about how I wanted to bring success to the club and deliver trophies.“About how I would be hellbent on making sure that was the case.“Now as I sit here six and a bit years on it is still the most important thing to me, to try to bring success to this club.”McInnes confirmed to the Evening Express in May he would be open to penning a new contract.Chairman Stewart Milne opened up discussions soon after on an extension to the contract which expired in .However it was put on the back-burner with the immediate focus on recruiting players during McInnes’ biggest summer rebuild since arriving at the club.McInnes said: “When the chairman approached me towards the end of last season it was something we said would get done once I got a few players in.“We wanted to make sure that was done first, that was the most important part.”McInnes has secured seven new signings during the summer transfer window and will add to that with the addition of a midfielder. The Dons had a bid, understood to be £,, accepted for Scunthorpe United midfielder Funso Ojo. But Hibs also had a bid for the same amount accepted by the League Two side.It is understood Hibs are leading the race to sign Ojo.McInnes also targeted Sunderland’s Dylan McGeouch but Black Cats manager Jack Ross has confirmed the midfielder wants to stay at the club.McInnes said: “The opportunity to continue working here excites me. It has been a big rebuilding job but I am excited with how the squad is coming together.“We are trying to be successful with Aberdeen.“I am also looking forward to going into the new training ground and the new stadium.“I am excited by a lot of the young players we are starting to bring through.“With the new signings in the squad we are putting together I am confident we can go and be as competitive as we have been.“Hopefully that will allow us to bring more silverware to the club.”During his six years at Pittodrie McInnes has delivered one trophy and lost three cup finals.Aberdeen are also competing in Europe for the sixth successive season under McInnes.Was extending his contract an easy decision  “Absolutely,” he said. “My staff and myself are happy here and we have managed to impose what we have here.“A lot of my players have also signed long-term deals.“There are a lot of good people working for me as a staff and a lot of good players.“I like working for my chairman and I like working for this club. It is important we try to maximise our full potential.“We have the excitement of the new training ground which will be a game changer for us.“Obviously plans are afoot for the new stadium as well and I would love to be part of that.“There is a real trust between myself and the chairman.“I will continue to strive to create special memories for our supporters.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/5d25803c57a8f3.27499636.jpg ","title":"30000 raised for clan in memory of north east mum","story":"A north-east family has raised more than £, for charity in memory of a we and mother.Mike Sangster, , and sons Ross, , and Fraser, , lost Amanda to cancer nearly five years ago and have devoted their energies to raising money for CLAN Cancer Support in her memory.Since September , the trio have taken part in five CLAN charity walks, organised three band nights, turned their hair purple for a month, taken on the Kiltwalk and even completed the Illuminator night-time half marathon run.The family, who live in Johnshaven, wanted to do everything they could to highlight the charity that helped Amanda, , after she was diagnosed.Ross, who had previously organised three band nights at Johnshaven Village Hall, stepped up his fundraising efforts with a charity ball at Aberdeen’s Altens Hotel in June, which raised nearly £,.The joiner said: “Having done three nights at the village hall I felt like it was time for change. Although I enjoyed organising them, I also felt like I’d taken it as far as I could so I wanted to challenge myself to do something bigger.“It actually all started when the hotel offered a raffle prize at the hall and they mentioned they could help out as a venue in the future, so it just went on from there really.“It’s almost frightening how much has been raised in such a short amount of time.“I had no idea how much money could be raised from the ball but it ended up being just under £, thanks to everyone’s generosity on the night.“I counted up everything from when we started and couldn’t believe we had passed £,.“I genuinely didn’t think we would raise anything like we did at the ball, but again it’s all down to everyone who continues to support everything we do.“Without them this wouldn’t be possible.”The trio aren’t finished yet as they are planning on taking part in the CLAN walk at Crathes Castle on September .The family will walk  miles and raise even more for the charity.Ross added: “I’d like to think my mum would be proud of what we’ve achieved for CLAN.“When we made a promise to her just days before she passed away that we would do something for CLAN, I never imagined that in just under five years it would go the way it has.“CLAN is a fantastic charity that did so much for my mum and I think she’d be just as amazed as we are at the way everyone has rallied around us and really supported everything we have done.”Despite the ball being Ross’s biggest challenge to date, he already has plans to hold a second charity dinner next year.He said: “We’ll be taking part in the CLAN walk again in September – it’s always great to go back and see so many people turn up to the event.“After the success of this year’s ball I’ve made a start to organising another charity ball for CLAN and have set a date – June  .”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

the  distinctive rooftop glass stars were painstakingly restored.The Fallago Environment Fund, which shares the benefits of the Fallago Wind Farm Development right across the Borders, provided pound, whilst the FCC Communities Foundation, a charitable foundation run by waste management company FCC Environment, donated pound,.A further pound, was provided through a Berwickshire Community

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though. There are a number of initiatives that the group hope will compliment the ethos of environmental action.bull Innerleithen, Walkerburn and Traquair Rotary Club ndash The Rotary Club has sponsored The Edible Garden which has enabled them to get leaflets, brochures and posters to help promote their bid for the Localities Fund. They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors.

The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too. He told the committee: ldquoIt has been dficult attracting sponsorship and corporate hospitality because of the uncertainty however, this seems to be improving."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-for-11-flats-on-car-park-in-haddington","story":"A decade ago the former Courier building on the corner of Haddingtonrsquos Market Street and Newton Port was bought by East Lothian Housing Association .ELHA converted the Market Street side of the building into its headquarters while the northern part was turned into  flats called The Granary.Now, the seven-space car park immediately adjacent to The Granary ndash used by residents there but also available to the general public ndash could be turned into  flats and associated car parking.A planning application has been lodged with East Lothian Council by developer Whiteadder Limited.If approved, there would be a total of  car parking spaces for the whole site ndash the new and the old flats.According to a design and access statement, which is included with the planning application, the site is ldquocurrently an unattractive car park which detracts from the town centre setting.It goes on: ldquoGiven the sitersquos location within the Haddington Conservation Area it represents an opportunity to redevelop a brownfield site.ldquoThe design of the new building will respect its historic context and character to create a positive contribution to the area.The ground floor would be home to a two-bedroom flat, with the first and second floors containing four two-bedroom properties and a one-bedroom flat.Outside, there would be a total of  car parking spaces, as well as a cycle store for  bicycles.Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had concerns about the plans.She said: ldquoWe did object to that for the simple reason that although they are providing car parking spaces, the existing cars that park there are going to have nowhere to park.ldquoYou are just adding that onto the congestion in the town.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, acknowledged the removal of general parking spaces could prove an issue.He said: ldquoIf the council came up with a solid idea and created a car park before they started going down the line of losing spaces, it would probably take the edge off the negativity surrounding any development, especially in the town centre.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

I know it doesnt mean that for everyone, but I love to race and compete. It is rivalry that made me fall in love with sport.Why cycling For a long time, cycling was the way that I got to other sports. I would ride my bike to the hockey club and swimming pool. It was about holidays and being with my family because it is such a social sport. We would go out riding together and cycle touring meant I got to see a lot of the world.It wasnt until I was a teenager that I combined the two passions of riding a bike and entering races. I started competing through the Highland Games grass track racing. There was a handicap, which meant I got a big head start and a taste for winning very quickly.Career high Winning gold at the  Rio Olympic Games.Career low Im a bit of a misery guts, so I am always convinced that the most recent race was my worst. I will moan to people, saying: \"Im going terribly\".Most sportspeople have an anecdote of when they went against the odds with an injury or setback. You almost cant prosper without these things. For me, it was tearing my PCL [posterior cruciate ligament] in my knee [in a motorcycle accident] back in .It was Christmas time and eight months before the Olympic Games. You start thinking that it is all going to slip away from you.What are the biggest misconceptions about what you do That sportspeople are motivated all the time.

And especially proud to represent all loyalists who serve her ndash even foul-mouthed Scotch police officers. I am, as you may know, referring to a particularly distasteful incident which took place in Glasgow last Saturday ndash which I believe has ldquogone viral on social media ndash where an unsavoury word many conflate with Jeremy Hunt was heard emanating from the mouth of a unormed officer, prefixed by the query ldquoAre you coming the.I will always defend those who themselves defend the Crown, no matter what distant region of Albion they hail from. So when Police Scotland officers employ Anglo-Saxon colloquialisms in the course ofduty, I must always assume it has been a wholly justiable belittling of female genitalia.The officerrsquos inquiry had apparently been deployed to ascertain the character of one particularly disruptive inidual ndash who was scurrilously attempting to spoil the buoyant mood of a glorious loyalist parade by blasting ldquorebel music from his car. How he got so close to these patriotic footsoldiers and joy-fuelled revellers with all the city-centre roads closed off, surrounded by motorway tailbacks, I have no idea. A truly disruptive person indeed.On these thankfully rare occasions, when officers of the law cross the line and let vile sexual crudities slip, I believe we must put our shock to one side and attempt to understand the context of such outbursts. And, as always, it seems all blame can be directed towardsthe fractured and Godless nature of todayrsquos society, where indference toine retribution has led to standards of the Queenrsquos English falling lower than the groin glands of the snake in the Garden of Eden.Itrsquos a truly sad day when the only way a dutul servant of Her Majesty can impose their authority is to attempt communicationwith these primitive creatures in their native tongue.The ides of marchDespite thisdisruption, it was wholly invigorating to witness so many of Her Majestyrsquos loyal defenders stride valiantly and gallantly through the city streets, glorying the Union as their ominous tribal thump echoed around the so-called Dear Green Place!It certainly filled my heart with optimism for the nationrsquos future.There were only eight arrests and apart from that, all more or less passed without incident. Unless you count jubilant cheering from the masses lining the route as a breach of the peace! Or the woman fallingfoul of the strictly-observed ldquodonrsquot cross the march rule who was shoved and spat on, butshe should perhapsbe grateful tohave DNA for any forthcoming trial. At least it wasnrsquot a Catholic priest this year!Although there was a distinct lack of reportage on this exhuberantannual celebration in the mainstream media ndash even in the so-called unionist press ndash I can confirm this was a rousing, joyous, inclusive, family parade. This was evident in the child-friendly aesthetic of Disney-like toy soldier unorms, comedygoose-stepping and Les Dawson-style musical timing ndash performed by men all clearly in robust health despite their advanced years, with the beetroot hue on their faces indicative of a burning internalpassion.Indeed, the jubilant onlookers could have lit cigarettes off the marchersrsquocheeksthey had so wished, an act perhapssymbolicof the undying torchflameof unionist fervourpassed on through countlessfuture generations.On evidence of this annual celebration of inherited reality tunnels, it will surely not be long until Orangefest ndash first and last held in  ndash makes a triumphantto George Square.

Ayrrsquos textile, wool, linen and shoemaking industries thrived for centuries afterwards. Crown funding provided by the Convention of Royal Burghs led to a lighthouse being built on the River Ayr in , a quay in  and also paid for much-needed repairs to the harbour and High Tolbooth. The CRB then installed street lighting for all ndash but little did they know that  years later a shameful display of open rebellion would cast the town back to the dark ages!After the procession in Glasgow, it was no surprise to hear that one of these so-called Bravehearts ndash many sporting battle re-enactment outfitsndash ended up on social media spouting a crude torrent of foul language, accusing a small gathering of pro-unionists of being female genitalia with unionist affiliations.And unlike the Orange Order, who have always worked closely with the council and police, the AUOB organisers apparently refused to apply for a licence or take out public liability insurance, claiming their ldquopeaceful rallies havenrsquot experienced any issues that required such legalities! Clearly then, it is somehow perfectly acceptable for nationalists to shout loudly about womenrsquos genitals in Ayr ndash but heaven forbid you are a loyal servant of Her Majesty doing the same thing in Glasgow while simply trying to maintain Order!And finally...YOU might be aware of yet another march that took place on the same day ndash Pridein London.

Is it the thin end of a wedge  Municipal neglect has a habit of creeping outwards like a bad stain.And so wersquore heartened to see some benign citizen development up on the Gallowgate at the old Bairdrsquos Bar next door to Barrowland. This is the cleverest, the most respectful of renovations. Residues of Celtic green paint cling to the ceiling. The materials- dark wood , brick, sandstone, clunking Victorian iron, obscure glass- encapsulate Glasgowrsquos vernacular architecture for me. Whatever was sound has been kept along with the odd bit of evocative whimsy. The old tenement stairs that now lead to nowhere have been kept above the bar. You pass a deep ceramic sink for washing clothes, the sort that was once commonplace in old ldquosteamies\". Such artacts are on display at the Peoplersquos Palace, and  Gallowgate only adds to the collection.In other ways  Gallowgate marches to its own tune, eschewing copycat menus. Its offering manages to be original, yet it fits its setting and location: simple, unfussy dishes, forgotten classics, such as corned beef hash, at reasonable prices that are realistic for its neighbourhood.Everything that reasonably can be is made in the kitchen, apart from the sourdough bread from the Freedom Bakery, and only ace bakers could better that. But the kitchen cures its own salt beef, we discover, as we kick off with the meaty, peppery salt beef fritters perched on frills of amiably mild sauerkraut, napped by punchy Reuben sauce and melting cheese.  Gallowgate clearly isnrsquot immune to cooking trends though. On todayrsquos specials menu therersquos caullower, pale-roasted, in a tumble of mint leaves, pea shoots, soft soaked raisins, toasted pine kernels, and grated Manchego cheese with perhaps a bit of sherry vinegar in its dressing, an idea I intend to steal for home cooking purposes.Boiled gammon and buttered cabbage with spring onion mash  Itrsquos got to be well done, or itrsquos dull. But this ham is a dream, not too salty, with a pale pink blush, it disintegrates in the mouth. The scallions, and a generous dosage of butter, make the mash unctuous the cabbage, Savoy Irsquod say, glistens with even more butter. No complaints from me on that last point.For pound, our hot salt beef sandwich is a steal. Our second chance to taste the succulent, well balanced cured beef, to appreciate just how well that Freedom Bakery bread with its tangible, but not overly chewy, crust works brilliantly in this context. Pickled cucumber spikes the meat and bread with vinegary sharpness while creamy horseradish lubricates it. Out of curiosity we have ordered a side of vinegar peas, another historical homage: back in the day they used to be sold to the Barrowland crowds from a whole in the wall eatery next door. Actually, these are broad beans, and a couple is enough for me, but they come with more sourdough and a pat of French butter. For pound, wersquore not complaining.Our servers are jolly and their enthusiasm for the deep fried custard, which turns out to be more like a doughnut with a custard core, is infectious. But wersquore more smitten with the rhubarb and ginger crumble, its deep layer of stem ginger-spiked fruit, its knobbly, crunchy topping.The people who opened  Gallowgate seem to get old Glasgow, its mood, its character, it value.

It has featured in films like Bonnie Prince Charlie, with the unlikely David Niven in the role in , The Master of Ballantrae with Erroll Flynn , Highlander and even the Bond movie The World is not enough. Itrsquos a staple of dozens of Bollywood movies too, soyoursquore visiting and see a group of dancers in brightly-coloured dhoti practising their steps yoursquove come to the right place.The castle was a stronghold of the Clans Mackenzie and McRae from the th Century before it was destroyed, in , by the Royal Navy in the Jacobite rebellion. Three ships anchored up and bombarded the castle and the clansmen and their Spanish allies for three days, reducing the place to rubble and taking dozens of prisoners. It lay as an empty ruin for more than  years until John MacRae-Gilstrap bought the pile in  and set about restoring it. So what you see today is a modern-day rendition although, fortunately, sans breeze blocks and polystyrene. It is now owned by a charitable MacRae family trust and the , visitors a year undoubtedly provide the upkeep.Scotland surely must have more castles per acre than any other country, and certainly per head of population, with around  and counting ndash more than the population of Aberfeldy or Drumnadrochit ndash although some are no more than relics of the past, hardly a stone upon a stone.

It was built in  and was a stronghold of the Galbraiths and passed on to the Hamiltonrsquos of Bardowie.Its more recent history is that it was owned by Jack Black ndash not the Rock School star or it would be no more than sandstone dust now ndash but the other one, the one who charges thousands to make motivational speeches. He used to be a social worker in Glasgowrsquos East End so he must wake up every day, even before he makes up a pithy epithet, to thank his lord he escaped the snotty weans and junkies.To quote the guru: ldquoThe greatest gt in le is the ability to think great thoughts and have the strength to take action so that those thoughts become reality in this wonderful and abundant world.Er, moving on it seems that Jack sold the castle at the end of  and the present owner is Glasgow vegetable dealer Alex Faithfullthrough his company Bardowie Holdings.

It was King David  who introduced them and encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle here, in an attempt to establish royal power throughout the country.Robert the Bruce must also take credit,thatrsquos the proper term, for what became known as ldquoslighting, that is capturing castles and destroying their fortications, which he did systematically, after wresting them from English control and presumably slaughtering the survivors. He even destroyed his own ones, at Ayr and Dumfries, Roxburgh and Edinburgh rather than allow them to be retaken by the English.When gunpowder was invented and guns and cannons evolved in the th century the design of castles changed, to the look we expect today, bombardment resistant walls, letter box gun ports and s to mount artillery.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmHighlands and Islands MSPs Jamie Halcro Johnston has joined Conservative colleagues in welcoming news that plans to introduce a sleeper service between Caithness and the Central Belt are gaining momentum.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The United States of America is a figment of our imagination. Russia is as real as the fake news that pours out on to the internet from within its fictional borders.However real they might seem, nation states belong in the realm of ideas, not tangible things, and John Lennon’s Imagine had it the wrong way round.OK, I admitTheresa May, Boris Johnson or whoever was to send a distinctly real British Army Challenger tank on to my front lawn and invite me to reconsider the non-existence of the United Kingdom, I most definitely would, might even start singing Land of Hope and Glory. Or at least try to, it would quite quickly descend into mumbling what I’d be hoping sounded like the words. But, thankfully, using the military to ensure the loyalty of its subjects runs counter to ideas about what the UK is all about. And ideas – such as, of course, nation states – can be powerful things. Good ideas have saved countless lives, just as bad ideas have ended them.Being ideas, countries can change and are probably always doing so, albeit usually in subtle, small ways that are barely noticeable but become apparent as time marches on. Some politicians today talk about British or Scottish values. In my book, this is a “categorisation error” and I’d much rather we talked about “democratic values”, but whatever values are held today in Scotland or the UK, they are very dferent to Victorian ones.There is no particular patch of planet Earth that must always be a liberal democracy – a haven of free speech, the rule of law and human rights – just as nowhere is eternally fated to languish in the grip of despotic rulers who think punishing people they don’t like with a lethal dose of nerve agent is a reasonable way to behave.So it is really important to keep up the pressure on whatever nation you happen to inhabit to move towards the light of freedom and away from sinister ideas that seem to have been re-emerging from the shadows in recent years.Here’s William McNeil, of the “hipster fascist” movement, Scotland for Generation Identity, attempting to explain to The Scotsman this week why his group did not promote a hateful, white supremacist ideology. “Anyone making this claim, intentionally or not, refuses to understand Identitarianism. It is not about skin colour, nor is it about anyone being better than another. All peoples have a right to preserve and promote their group identity in their homelands.”In case you don’t know, Generation Identity’s leader in Austria, Martin Sellner, exchanged emails with and accepted a donation of €, from Brendan Tarrant, the Australian charged over the murder of  people at two mosques in New Zealand in March. Sellner insists he doesn’t believe in violence, but clearly Tarrant was a fan.There are no dferent human “peoples” or races, these are ideas entirely invented by racists. Tarrant killed people at random simply because they were Muslim just as Isis killed Salford taxi driver Alan Henning – despite the pleas of Islamic scholars to spare the le of someone who went to Syria to deliver aid. Both Isis and Tarrant bought into the idea that their victims were so defined by their religion or their nation that they could be killed for that reason alone.For some self-described patriots, nationality plays just as strong a part in defining a human being as race does for racists or religion does for the most fanatical of religious bigots .In his short poem Patriot, the late Norman MacCaig – I first wrote that he was a “Scottish poet” but then decided to delete that bit – offered a dferent vision:My only countryIs six feet highAnd whether I love it or notI’ll dieFor its independenceThe Person’s Republic of Ian Johnston wholeheartedly agrees and, however tall we are, most of us know we are an inidual – insert the funny line from Monty Python’s Le of Brian here – even those prone to seeing others as nothing but the faceless members of some group of millions of people. Despite all this, I am happy to say that countries – even though they are just ideas – are very important. I’m also happy to pay my taxes and do all the things you are supposed to do as a citizen of the UK. However, nations are important as a unit of democracy, perhaps the fundamental unit of democracy. They help human beings organise themselves into large groups in which their rights as iniduals are protected. That’s what countries should do anyway. How big that group is, what territory it controls or who is a member should not be the main concern.But medieval ideas about nation states still persist.In the not-so-good-old days, kings who led armies to conquer were heroes. Those who questioned their power too much were traitors whose heads would likely end up on a spike. With no genuinely legitimate claim to power – the hereditary principle not being one – loyalty had to be enforced on pain of death. This is still true in today’s tyrannies.In countries that are liberal democracies, where iniduals agree to put people into power, knowing they can be removednecessary, strict penalties for treason are not necessary. As a criminal offence, it has all but died out in the UK. And yet, amid the passionate debates about Scottish independence and Brexit, bitter accusations of treason have been thrown about quite a lot. That, in my view, is a slippery slope that risks a slide through the mire towards the insanity of Isis, Generation Identity and the rest.Inidual human beings are real. Nations are not. They are ideas that we have made effectively real because we believe in them so much and because it is useful in a practical way. But, we must resist the temperation to believe in them too much or we will lose touch with reality.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"former lib dem leader ming campbell says constitutional reform is needed in uk","story":"The UK constitution needs #root and branch# reform to take the antagonism out of the relationship between governments in London and Edinburgh, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats has said.Sir Menzies Campbell, who was the architect of the Lib Dems’ modern proposals for Scottish Home Rule, called for a constitutional convention to create a settled will around devolution in England and set the agenda for a federal UK.And he criticised the recent decision by the Foreign Office to withdraw support from Nicola Sturgeon’s overseas trips, calling it “foolish” and “unnecessary”.Speaking to Scotland on Sunday to mark the th anniversary of the Scottish parliament, and following the announcement of the UK government launching a review of how Whitehall interacts with devolution, Campbell said good relations between Edinburgh and London were based on “personality, personality, personality”.The peer, who led the Lib Dems from  to , said the early successes of devolution were based on relationships between Donald Dewar and Tony Blair, and between Dewar and Lib Dem deputy Jim Wallace.And he hailed the close partnership between Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Michael Moore and then-Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in delivering the Edinburgh Agreement, that saw both governments sign up to a legally-recognised independence referendum in .Asked about the more recent constitutional deadlock over Brexit, Campbell said: “Part of the problem is that the relationship between Edinburgh and Westminster has not really grown in the way it should have done, and I think both parties are to blame.“Edinburgh’s default position is that it’s all Westminster’s fault, and Westminster’s position is that these bloody Scots are just making a nuisance of themselves.”In the latest sign that relations between the two governments are at an all-time low, Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt announced that his department would no longer routinely provide support to the First Minister’s overseas travel, unless she agrees not to “promote independence”.“I thought that was foolish … it’s unnecessary,” said Campbell, who was the foreign affairs spokesman for the third party at Westminster for  years. “I think it is nitpicking, and politically parsimonious to say to her, we’re not going to help with the visits.“What’s the point of that  She’ll go anyway. And she’ll make a thing of the fact that she’s able to achieve these visits without the help of the Foreign Office.“The Foreign Office isn’t just for Westminster, it’s for the United Kingdom. Would they have tried to do that with [David] Trimble and [Martin] McGuinness [the leaders of devolved power-sharing in Northern Ireland]  Of course they wouldn’t.“My view is that it’s completely unnecessary and it simply creates a sense of grievance, and anyway she’ll get the visits, because the people on the other side of the Atlantic will be anxious to know what she’s about.”Campbell led the Lib Dem Home Rule Commission, reporting on the need to overhaul the UK’s constitution in .An update shortly before the independence referendum helped build momentum towards the creation of the Smith Commission in the wake of Scotland’s vote to stay in the UK, which resulted in signicant new tax and welfare powers being devolved to Edinburgh.The Lib Dem peer now sits on the steering committee of the cross-party Constitutional Reform Group, which has put forward its own proposals for a “new Act of Union”.Campbell said that after  years of devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, England “needs a constitutional convention”.“The English have to decide what they want,” he said, going on to question the piecemeal approach to local devolution south of the border. “English local government – you need a PhD to understand it.”He revealed that Baroness Bryan, who is developing Labour policy on a “People’s Constitutional Convention” that Jeremy Corbyn says will lead to a federal UK, has met with him and examined the Constitutional Reform Group’s proposals.But Campbell said she faces a “pretty tricky job” with just nine months left to produce a report, and a single researcher supporting her.He called for Westminster to be “much more open minded” to a major overhaul of the constitution, but defended the Lib Dems’ refusal to take part in Scottish Government-organised citizens’ assemblies on new powers for Scotland unless independence is parked.“[The constitution] needs a root and branch approach,” Campbell said. “For that you’ve got to have co-operation on both sides of the argument.“If Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP say it’s independence or bust, then that makes it very dficult, but you can nonetheless say, park your independence for the moment, we understand that’s what you’re about, but we can have a sensible and logical discussion about how we improve the relationship ... The problem is that Joanna Cherry gave the game away because she said it’s leading to independence.”The Lib Dem peer said there was a “legalistic” case for the UK Government to retain devolved responsibilities ing from Brussels after Brexit, which are at the heart of the row between Edinburgh and London over claims of a “power grab”, and which saw the two governments face each other in the Supreme Court over rival Brexit legislation.But he is critical of how the UK Government went about resolving the dispute.“There’s a legalistic argument that Britain joined the EU, and Britain leaves the EU. Therefore those powers which were ceded to the EU come back to Britain … but they were so dog in the manger about it, and that of course was Theresa [May]. You can’t have seen Blair being so dyed in the wool about it.”And Campbell said the decision of the UK Government to press ahead with Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament, in breach of the Sewel convention, set an “uncomfortable” precedent.“We don’t have a written constitution in this country, people say. Well actually, we have a half written constitution becauseyou think about it, a huge amount of what we regard to be constitutional law, it’s by statute.“I think the marriage of statute and convention has been shown to be a rather uncomfortable one, particularly in the context of Brexit. Sewel is a very good example of that.”With critics in the SNP, Labour and the Conservatives all calling for the role of the Scotland Office to be reviewed and potentially abolished, Campbell defended Dover House.“There are strong administrative reasons for saying yes, and there are strong political reasons for saying no,” he said about eliminating the Scotland Office.“You can make the argument that, OK,there is a proper relationship between Edinburgh and London, then no, you don’t need it.“But you can equally make the argument thatthere is someone in London who’s in the tent … then you have the opportunity to influence events.”An SNP spokesperson said: “It is entirely legitimate for Scotland’s First Minister to speak to the views that she was democratically elected on, but withdrawing Foreign Office support did not impede on the plans of the First Minister’s visit to Europe.“Andthe Tories’ position is now that Scotland shouldn’t be afforded the same level of representation as the rest of the UK, then they are making our case for us – it shows how we need to be independent.“The Citizens’ Assembly will be an entirely independent body – a position that has been made clear by the Scottish Government and the co-convener of the Assembly. There remains plenty of opportunity for the Lib Dems to rediscover their liberal and democratic values and to support the assembly, however as it will be made up of citizens, the decision of any party to opt out will not impact on its success.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point.

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast beauty revealed again as scaffolding comes down on the mac","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr O Cadhla was raised in the Ring Gaeltacht and previously represented the Cobh area on Cork County Council.After receiving summonses on charges of criminal damage in , Mr O Cadhla wrote to the clerk of Cork District Court asking that his trial be conducted in Irish. But when the matter came before Judge Olann Kelleher in November , the judge said he intended to conduct the hearing in English as he knew the applicant could speak English.At later hearings an interpreter was provided, but Mr O Cadhla complained the interpreter could not translate both for him and the judge simultaneously.The case was adjourned after Mr O Cadhla asked the High Court to consider the constitutionality of Judge Kellehers decision. Mr O Cadhla claimed he would be placed at a disadvantagehis evidence was heard by a judge \"through the prism of a translation\" rather than in its original form.He argued this amounted to unequal treatment and was in conflict with Article  of the Constitution. This article provides that Irish is the first official language and English the second.It also says that provision may be made by law for the exclusive use of either language for official purposes.Mr O Cadhlas action was opposed by the State, which argued that any disadvantage he alleged could be cured by the process of translation. However, the court heard from a number of solicitors that it was \"usual practice\" for a bilingual judge to be found where one was requested.Ms Justice Ni Raeartaigh said that, in a nutshell, the case concerned whether or not there was any right to be heard and understood in Irish by the district judge, as distinct from the right to speak and present ones case in Irish. She said the refusal to provide a bilingual judge appeared to her to be contrary to the spirit of Article  and previous jurisprudence. The judge said she was inclined to grant a declaration that there was a duty to make reasonable efforts to assign a bilingual judge for Mr O Cadhlas forthcoming trial and that she did not believe this would cause any signicant practical problems."},{"url":null,"title":"shop staff form guard of honour as primark founders hearse passes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news. It has taken  years and caused a lot of hurt for so long.“I am hoping that the findings will come out the way that we want it and we will be travelling together as family to Belfast next month to hear the outcome.“It destroyed our family, but I had to get the answer about what happened and I am certainly looking forward to that.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Among the start-up activities in the Centre will be classes in woodwork, woodcarving, cooking and baking and a range of arts and crafts.In the longer term it is hoped that the Centre will also be able to offer classes in pottery, gardening and horticulture and knitting and sowing.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
