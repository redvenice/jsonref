But H5N1 has for years been highlighted as a potential pandemic threat due to how contagious it is in animals. It is feared that as the virus spreads, it may acquire mutations which make it easier to infect humans.Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline that bird flu could be the next human pandemic.  Amid fears there could be a resurgence in influenza cases in the UK this winter, Professor Hunter said being infected with bird flu and regular flu at the same time could also trigger dangerous mutations. He said: \u0027That\u0027s thought to be how some flu pandemic started in the past, most recently in 1968 and 1957. That\u0027s why people worry more about containing bird flu and ensuring it does not spread.\u0027But it\u0027s an extremely rare event that is possible but unlikely. Not a lot of people have flu at the moment, so there is a vanishingly small risk of a person with the flu catching bird flu, but it has happened in the past and could trigger a pandemic if it happened now.\u0027But the development comes with fears about infectious pathogens at an all-time high in the UK after two years of the Covid pandemic, reignited by the latest surge in Omicron infections.     Mr Gosling, a father of three, grew close to the ducks over several years of feeding them. They had settled near his home – but he eventually invited 20 to live inside with him.Shortly before Christmas, he noticed the ducks were becoming ill and they subsequently tested positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu. As a precaution, health officials swabbed Mr Gosling and detected low levels of the H5 flu found in birds. It remains unconfirmed whether he has the N1 strain.Nevertheless, the result makes Mr Gosling the first human in the UK – or Europe – to become infected with H5.Mr Gosling did not need hospital treatment, and officials said there was no evidence he has spread it to anyone else.His close personal contacts, including anyone who visited his home, have been traced and there is \u0027no evidence\u0027 of the infection having spread to anyone else, the UK Health Security Agency said.The current H5N1 outbreak is the largest bird flu crisis ever recorded in Britain, with 2million poultry culled as part of efforts to control the virus.  Britain\u0027s outbreak is part of the spiralling crisis currently ravaging Europe and has been going on for weeks, which sparked fears of a turkey shortage in the run-up to Christmas. Bird to human transmission of bird flu — also known as avian flu — is rare and has only occurred a small number of times in the UK. However, the public is being urged not to touch sick or dead birds.Subsequent human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is even rarer, meaning the risk of a major outbreak in people is deemed to be even lower.      The case was first detected after the UK\u0027s Animal and Plant Health Agency, identified an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian flu in the person\u0027s flock of birds. As a precaution, UKHSA swabbed the person involved and detected low levels of flu. Further lab analysis showed the virus was the \u0027H5\u0027 type found in birds but have UKHSA said it has not been possible to confirm that this is the same H5N1 infection currently circulating in birds Britain.   You can donate to the fundraiser here. Fundraiser by Ellesha Gosling : Help Alan Gosling clean \u0026ampdisinfect the property"},{"url":null,"title":"Obsessive tests tantamount self harming writes PROF ANGUS DALGLEISH","story":"Share this article        It is also insanity. The Omicron variant is rampant, spreading through every part of the population, and no amount of self-isolation can halt it. But we also know that Omicron is very mild.Without any further restrictions being introduced over the Christmas and New Year period, hospitalisations have remained steadily below half the levels seen last winter, when we were in a full national lockdown.And of those who are admitted into hospital, many fewer require critical care. We know that the vaccines are doing their job and are protecting the vast majority.While the daily number of new infections may sound alarming, most people with Omicon are experiencing nothing more than cold-like symptoms – if any at all – and yet are still being forced to sign off work for at least seven days. There is a glimmer of hope, however, with unnamed ‘Whitehall sources’ hinting at the weekend that the policy of providing unlimited free lateral flow tests to the public has to end.       So far £6billion has been spent on these kits. Think how much could have been saved if tests had only been provided to places where identifying potential infections really matters, such as care homes and hospitals, as opposed to mass DIY testing in the population at large.Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi also struck a note of good sense yesterday, when he suggested the seven-day isolation period for people with Covid should be reduced to five. But really, that’s the least we can do.As the former chairman of the UK’s vaccine taskforce, Dr Clive Dix, said, Britain now needs a major rethink on its Covid policy, with a move towards treating the virus as similar to seasonal flu.Our hospitals are under immense pressure – but not from the predicted wave of Covid patients.

Of course don’t get too wrapped up and forget to follow our Covid updates! The inquiry, into allegations of social mixing bans being broken in No 10, was widened this weekend to include reported gatherings from May 2020, amid reports that an official emailed Downing Street staff inviting them to socially distanced drinks. No 10 did not deny on Sunday that the prime minister and his wife attended the event on 20 May, which is said to have been organised by a senior civil servant in Johnson’s private office, Martin Reynolds, with food and wine set out on tables. It comes after the  reported a “wine and pizza” party in Downing Street in the garden and inside No 10 on 15 May, with staff drinking late into the evening after a press conference that day. After No 10 insisted staff were working, the  obtained a photograph of the prime minister and his wife sitting with officials at a table with wine and cheese, with 15 other staff in the background and bottles of wine visible. The story highlights a gulf in opinions on what “living with Covid” might look like, with some saying we will achieve this only through continued caution and others equating the phrase to ditching all Covid measures and partying like it’s 2019. Wherever your instincts lie, it is not surprising – or even undesirable – that the mass testing of asymptomatic people is being reviewed. The policy was rapidly brought in at a time when, faced with a new, highly infectious variant of unknown virulence, it made sense to throw everything we had at Omicron to slow down transmission and to minimise disruption caused by essential workers having to self-isolate. With case numbers wildly outstripping the UK’s laboratory testing capacity, lateral flow tests continue to be vital for tracking case numbers. Mark Harper, chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group, also said the Prime Minister could even face a leadership challenge if the Tories do badly in May’s local elections. The former chief whip’s intervention came after a poll of Conservative members suggested nearly half believe Chancellor Rishi Sunak would make a better leader. Mr Johnson suffered the biggest revolt of his premiership last month when 100 backbenchers defied him over Plan B restrictions in a Commons vote. Dr Clive Dix has called for an overhaul of the current Government strategy in the coming months, claiming the impact of cellular immunity on fighting the virus may have been downplayed. Covid should instead be treated like flu or a heavy cold among younger people who have been fully jabbed, the former vaccines tsar said. Speaking to C4 News, Dr Dix claimed that mass vaccination has outlasted its main purpose, which he said was to curb the spread of infection.“We do not know exactly how well these tests work for Omicron,” Lauterbach said on public broadcasting channel ARD, adding the results of the assessment would become available within the next few weeks. It was clear, however, that “the alternative not to test at all ... would be far too dangerous,” said Lauterbach, a scientist and physician. Earlier, he had told a Sunday newspaper that Germany must revamp its Covid vaccination strategy to tackle the Omicron variant and to ensure it could develop a new vaccine rapidly if it faced a more deadly coronavirus variant in the future. New measures for dining out and bar visits were brought in only last Friday, Reuters reports.Italy has registered 139,038 deaths linked to Covid-19 since the initial outbreak in February 2020, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth highest in the world.

Thank you for reading and keep safe.By contrast, in the UK, Boris Johnson has confined himself to accusing anti-vaxxers of talking “mumbo-jumbo”. But is that enough? Should the UK take a harder line on those who refuse to be vaccinated? After all, this is a virus that threatens to overwhelm the NHS. As doctors continue to point out, hospital beds are now filling up with more and more seriously ill Covid patients, many of whom are unvaccinated.  So, should vaccines against Covid be made mandatory, not just in certain workplace settings but for all iniduals? As Bloomberg reports, the cases are a worrying trend for officials who have upheld a “Covid zero” strategy, sacrificing the city’s status as an international hub to bring in some of the world’s harshest measures and isolating itself from the rest of the world.  “Now it’s living with the worst of both worlds,” it writes, after a couple of imported infections triggered renewed measures. The government has banned indoor dining after 6pm and closed swimming pools, sports centres, bars and clubs, museums and other venues. Expatriates who travelled home for Christmas have also been unable to return to Hong Kong, after authorities fearing the highly contagious Omicron variant suspended flights from eight countries, including the UK and the US. Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, he said his organisation was working urgently to encourage staff to come forward for vaccination to avoid redeploying or losing them. Losing more than 1,000 staff would be the most extreme outcome and there had been an increase in the number of people who still required vaccination coming forward, Kay said. “I don’t want, at this stage, to predict or give any numbers. We’re having conversations with staff, line managers are having conversations with staff, we have a helpline,” he said. “Ultimately if iniduals choose not to, it’s their choice, their personal choice.

Qatar has reintroduced measures limiting home gatherings to 10 vaccinated people, as well as barring unvaccinated people from entering shopping malls and restaurants and reducing capacity limits for some commercial establishments. Schools have reintroduced distance learning until at least 27 January. Saudi Arabia has also seen a rapid increase in cases since the start of the year, although still below the numbers seen in June 2020.His warnings come as a further 21,384 cases of Covid were reported by the Department of Health, a day after Ireland reported a record 26,122 new cases.  As of 8am on Sunday, 984 people were in hospital with the virus, up 67 in the last 24 hours. That is the highest number of people in hospital since the surge last January.

Now, travellers must undergo a 14-day quarantine, or enter under a “Sandbox” scheme via Phuket, which allows fully vaccinated tourists to stay for seven days before being cleared to move around the country.

Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 21 384 more cases confirmed as health system under stress","story":"HSE chief executive Paul Reid says there is ‘room for optimism’ as booster vaccines give greater protection and ICU cases hold stable. Photograph: Leah FarrellPhotocall IrelandA further 21,384 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded by the Department of Health as the Omicron surge puts the health service “under stress” with close to 15,000 staff absent due to the virus.As of 8am on Sunday, 984 people were in hospital with the virus, up 67 in the last 24 hours. There are 83 patients with the virus being treated in intensive care (ICU).That is the highest number in hospital since the surge last January. However, head of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Paul Reid said there was “room for optimism” as booster vaccines were giving greater protection and ICU numbers continue to remain relatively stable.Mr Reid said the “most immediate impact” the latest surge of cases is having is on staff numbers.Nearly 15,000 staff are out due to Covid, he said, out of a total complement of about 120,000. “The number of staff we have out with Covid is really hurting hard,” he added.Mr Reid said on Twitter there was evidence of less severity associated with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 but “nobody is hospitalised for mild illness”.In Northern Ireland, two more patients who previously tested positive for Covid-19 have died. Another 3,760 positive cases of the virus were also confirmed by the North’s Department of Health on Sunday.Mr Reid said the HSE is developing a new integrated system to allow members of the public to register positive antigen tests.“The system will be ready throughout the course of next week,” he added.Vaccines for childrenMr Reid said more than 82,000 children aged five to 11 had registered for the Covid-19 vaccine as of Saturday evening.Speaking to Newstalk’s On the Record, Mr Reid said it was a busy weekend as the rollout of the vaccine to this age cohort began.Some 20,000 vaccines were administered to these children to date, Mr Reid said, adding that 9,800 of those were high-risk children.Mr Reid said “what was very special” was the feedback from parents, s and children who were excited to receive the jab.“It was a nice occasion overall, I think well-managed, and great care was provided by our professional vaccinators on the day. Ultimately we’re really pleased to have started this right now,” he said.Mr Reid said the process of administering vaccines to this age group takes “twice as long” as the vaccination process for adults in order to give children “good care”.He said the level of registrations is “in line” with what they saw with the 12 to 15-year-old age cohort, when there was a “slow and steady uptake” as parents took time to read the information available on the vaccines.Almost 2.4 million boosters or third doses have also been administered in the State to date.There was “phenomenal” uptake of boosters in the four days running up to Christmas, Mr Reid said, as people opted to increase their level of protection in advance of meeting with family over the festive period.“I would be urging the public that it’s really important that you come forward for the vaccine. Don’t leave it any longer. It does give you a much higher level of protection, particularly with Omicron,” he added.Close contactsOn Saturday evening, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said new guidance on close contacts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) would give the State “options” to consider.The health authority said some Covid-19 public health measures could be relaxed to help health systems cope with extreme pressure due to staffing issues amid high infection rates.On Friday, it issued updated guidelines to European Union members on isolation and quarantine measures in light of the “rapid spread” of the more transmissible Omicron variant across the bloc.Several arms of the State’s health apparatus had already warned that disruption caused by measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 is intensifying in the health service.The new guidance includes new options regarding quarantine and isolation, and recommendations that can be adapted and implemented when resources are limited and when there is high pressure on healthcare systems and other functions in society.The ECDC’s overall guidance regarding quarantine remains unchanged, but the options proposed include shorter quarantine periods for close contacts of Covid-19 cases in case of high and extreme pressure on healthcare systems and society.In the options for isolation of Covid-19 cases, the clinical improvement now required includes a resolution of fever for 24 hours instead of for three days. The options also include testing by rapid antigen tests to release patients from isolation.Shorter periods of isolation are also proposed in the options, which are for essential workers, in case of high and extreme pressure to healthcare and society.The options also include removing the need for vaccinated close contacts of people infected with Covid-19 to quarantine if the health system is under extreme pressure.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"south africa offers clues to life after omicron","story":"A boy receives a Covid-19  vaccine in Sandton, Johannesburg. Photograph: Luca SolaAFP via Getty ImagesJust weeks ago, South Africa was the focus of the world’s anxieties over Omicron as infections rocketed in one of the first countries to detect the highly contagious coronavirus variant.But with the new variant now prevalent worldwide, South Africa is providing clues to life after Omicron. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s government has said the country’s fourth Covid-19 wave has peaked. Total excess deaths attributed to Omicron are about 10,000, compared with about 110,000 excess deaths during the previous, Delta-driven wave.Even though three-quarters of all South Africans are still not double jabbed against Covid-19, vaccinations, immunity after previous infections and signs that Omicron is a milder disease appear to have kept the pressure off hospitals.“The most important issue is that there was a clear decoupling between community spread, which has been very rapid, and the level of hospital admissions,” said Richard Friedland, chief executive of Netcare, South Africa’s biggest provider of private healthcare. “We have not suspended elective surgeries, and there is no pressure on beds . . . We have had no capacity constraints at all in the fourth wave.”Speed of surgeIn Gauteng, South Africa’s economic hub and the initial centre of the Omicron outbreak, excess deaths have also peaked, far below previous waves, just weeks after the surge.“The incredible speed of this wave is still what I’m surprised at,” said François Venter, an expert on HIV and infectious diseases at Johannesburg’s Wits University. “This is the one wave where everyone I knew has been infected.”This is all the more striking because South Africa has high levels of immunity compared with other countries. One recent study estimated there were antibodies in about three-quarters of blood samples taken in Gauteng as Omicron struck.Excess natural deaths last year, for example, were more than 200,000, mostly ascribed to coronavirus and far beyond South Africa’s official pandemic death toll of just over 90,000 people. The country’s total population is 60m.“That is pretty sobering,” said Tom Moultrie, professor of demography at the University of Cape Town, who tallies the excess death figures with a team of scientists. “We have possibly had a low-mortality situation in South Africa with Omicron by virtue of the burden we have suffered.”Peak hospital admissions in South Africa’s Omicron wave were about two-thirds of the Delta peak. But this figure hides an important nuance that underlines the mild or moderate nature of many cases compared with past waves, Friedland said.“A new category of patients emerged, which we had not seen in the past three waves – something we have classified as incidental Covid,” he said. During the Delta wave, nearly all of the positive patients in Netcare hospitals had acute respiratory problems. This time it was about a third.Whereas maternal Covid-19 cases were often very serious in previous waves because of the possible complications, “one day in December in one of our hospitals, out of 14 births that day, 13 patients tested positive, and all were asymptomatic”, Friedland said.The typical time patients stayed in hospital remained at about three days under Omicron, compared with about seven days in the other waves, he added.It was “very heartening” that South African public and private hospitals were able to deal with Omicron-related admissions without being overwhelmed, Venter said. It also showed the value of early warnings so that doctors could prepare, he added.Virus fragmentsSouth African scientists not only discovered the Omicron variant early but also studied indicators such as the prevalence of virus fragments in waste water samples to determine its rapid initial spread.While rates of severe and deadly cases with Omicron were far lower than during the Delta wave, South Africa’s pandemic monitoring now needs to understand who was most affected by the variant. “That will inform who we need to vaccinate urgently next time,” Venter said. “We need to know who we need to put at the front of the queue.”Ramaphosa’s government is still behind on its target of 70 per cent of the adult population for first vaccinations. Rollout has been dogged by the unequal distribution of jabs and the cost of getting to vaccination sites.“You can’t just simply offer vaccines and say it is the public’s fault for not coming forward. You have to make it easy to access,” Venter said.As South Africa emerges from this wave, Moultrie cautions on “over-extrapolating our experience to other countries”.Omicron’s contagious nature may have different implications for pressure on hospitals in countries with older populations and without South Africa’s high rate of past infections.“It might not be the utter carnage of previous waves, but it can still place health systems under strain,” Moultrie said.South Africa is also showing that Omicron waves may not fade as rapidly as they emerge. The proportion of tests that come back positive is now far below peaks of 40 per cent in some areas. But in Gauteng, positive test rates have only just fallen below 20 per cent.“I think that it is premature either to say it is the end of the world or a ‘nothingburger’,” Moultrie said. “The uncomfortable truth is somewhere between that. It is a lesson in sobriety.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"serbia unites to offer cheer to stricken tennis hero novak djokovic","story":"  A woman holds a placard reading ‘Victory!’ during a rally in front of Serbia’s National Assembly, in Belgrade,   over   Australia’s  decision to revoke     Novak Djokovic’s visa. Photograph: Oliver BunicAFP via Getty ImagesNovak Djokovic can count on one thing during his involuntary stay in a Melbourne asylum detention centre: rock-solid support from his fans back home in Serbia.As the country celebrated Orthodox Christmas on Friday, Serbians were united behind the world number one in men’s tennis – and well-known coronavirus vaccine sceptic – whose participation in the Australian Open is in doubt after authorities there revoked his entry visa after he landed.Djokovic, who has been critical of vaccinations and restrictions amid the pandemic, has refused to disclose his vaccination status to authorities. He had been relying on a medical exemption to get into Australia, where he hoped to get a record 21st “grand slam” title and his 10th Australian trophy.Belgrade’s foreign ministry has complained that Djokovic was a victim of a “political game” and charged that he had been “lured to travel to Australia in order to be humiliated”.It urged that the star be allowed to spend Christmas in better accommodation – a dig at Melbourne’s Park Hotel, where Djokovic has been housed in quarantine quarters alongside refugees, some who have been detained for years.There was “understandable indignation of his fans and citizens of Serbia”, the foreign ministry said.The Serbian Orthodox Church also weighed in. Its Patriarch Porfirije said he had spoken with Djokovic, reassuring him of his support.Criticising vaccinations“Dear Novak, from the troubles and temptations you are going through on Christmas, the day of joy, tomorrow only a pale shadow will remain,” Porfirije wrote on Instagram. “Millions of Orthodox Serbs pray for you, as you do for us.”Djokovic has been close to the Orthodox church, which bestowed upon him its highest honour, the order of St Sava, in 2011 for his help for monasteries, especially in Kosovo.Besides criticising mandatory vaccinations and restrictions Djokovic (34) also defied pandemic rules and organised a series of exhibition tennis events, dubbed the Adria Tour, at the height of the pandemic’s first wave in 2020, which helped spread infections. He and his wife caught the virus.His attitude to the pandemic has done little to harm his following across the Balkans, where vaccine scepticism is rampant and inoculation rates are consistently well below the European average.In Serbia, less than half of the population has received a first dose of a vaccine, compared to more than 70 per cent in the European Union, according to Financial Times data. The coronavirus has been deadlier in the Balkans than in Europe as a whole, with Serbia recording several times as many deaths per capita as the EU for most of the autumn.With just three months to go until Serbian elections, political leaders expressed support for Djokovic, whose role is widely seen as a benchmark of national unity.“I’ve just finished my telephone conversation with Novak Djokovic,” Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic posted on Instagram last week.‘Harassment’“I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our authorities are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world’s best tennis player is brought to an end immediately.”Former premier Ivica Dacic, the leader of the ruling coalition Socialist party, said Djokovic “did not invite himself, they granted him the so-called exemption,” Mr Dacic told TV Pink, recalling a similar exemption he had to get to allow entry to the Glasgow climate summit with his Russian vaccines.Calling Djokovic’s treatment “shameful”, Mr Dacic said in Australia “politics is unstable because everyone is chasing ratings . . . leading to political abuse”.Djokovic’s family led a small protest outside the country’s parliament last week, where a few hundred people draped themselves in national flags to express solidarity with the tennis star. His father Srdjan Djokovic said his son was the symbol of a “free world”.“Shame on them, the entire freedom-loving world should rise together with Serbia,” Srdjan Djokovic said. “They crucified Jesus and now they are trying to crucify Novak the same way and force him on his knees.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"brace human free shopping revolution","story":"The Daily  recently reviewed Boutiques by Lucien Boucher, a volume of lithographs of Parisian shopfronts published in 1925 and reissued by The Mainstone Press. It records a world poised at a moment of change, as reflected in its high street shopfronts. A grisly ensemble of prosthetic limbs in the Bandagiste’s window recalls the enduring devastation of the First World War, while a jaunty constellation of gramophone horns looks forward to the jazz age.In 1938, at another moment of flux, Eric Ravilious published High Street, his own lithographic record of the British high street. More than 80 years on, his vision of the urban high street survives, despite the creep of coffee bars and fashion chains, in market towns across the land.But for how much longer? In January 1948, the first British supermarket opened and self-service shopping was born. Now technology is poised to eliminate both queuing at the checkout and shoplifting, replacing tills with surveillance technology that records the items a customer selects and charges them via their phone. Amazon, with the major supermarkets, is in the vanguard of this shopping revolution, with hundreds of contactless shops reportedly planned.Shopping utopia or dystopia? The latter, certainly, for the checkout assistants who worked bravely throughout the Covid lockdowns people who lack the necessary technology, and for whom a chat with a kindly assistant is their only human contact of the day and even those (I am one) who cherish the rich theatre of queuing. For retailers, a reduction in shoplifting (which costs around £5.5bn per year), along with a lower wage bill is an unarguable win.In the UK, the closing of village shops is a perennial theme. My grandmother endured it and my mother endures it now. Having survived the supermarket revolution, those indomitable women might conclude that till-free shopping is better than no shopping at all. In Sweden, people living in villages with no local shop have welcomed the advent of small contactless stores.As for the sinister creep of surveillance technology - if the modest purchases of a harassed working parent or independent nonagenarian are really of interest to Jeff Bezos and his chums, that might be a price worth paying for a frictionless pint of milk and loaf of bread.Three cheers to the return of the bookshopAs a passionate collector of physical (or, as my partner calls them, “superfluous”) books, I am delighted by the evidence of their survival in the face of technology. Last week the Duchess of Cornwall was photographed in a phone box library in Abergeldie, Scotland, and my local farm shop and railway station maintain bookshelves offering treasures in return for a charity donation.Imagine, then, the pleasure of discovering that a new generation of young booksellers is defying the online trend to sell real books in real shops. No algorithm, one new bookseller observes, can replace the human touch. The life of a bookshop owner is not easy, and new booksellers would do well to avoid Penelope Fitzgerald’s brilliant, bleak novel, The Bookshop, based on her own experience.But when almost all is lost, Fitzgerald’s proprietor salvages two volumes, one bookmarked with a pressed gentian - a skeletal bloom that would blossom into her masterpiece, The Blue Flower. Real books offer real rewards, in unexpected ways.More from NewsNovak Djokovic latest news: Tennis star\u0026#39s Australian Open hopes in the balance as legal team prepare for visa appeal hearingBoris Johnson expected to face questions over No 10 garden partiesRishi Sunak backs call for Covid isolation to be cut to five daysBritain will ‘stand up to bullies’, declares Ben Wallace as he marks Falklands War anniversaryNHS told: send cancer patients to private hospitals so they can be treatedMinisters have a responsibility to lead the charge back to normalityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases approach peak parts england data show","story":"Covid cases are now falling outside of London, and all parts of England are showing signs of nearing their peak, data show.Official records show that as of January 8, new case numbers are beginning to fall in the South East and the East of England, as well as in London, which peaked before Christmas.Cases are still increasing in all other regions, but at a much slower rate than before.It comes as the number of people on mechanical ventilators in England drops to its lowest level since October despite experts believing there may be around half a million infections a day.Daily figures for Covid cases, hospitalisations and deaths have been disrupted due to the Christmas period, but are now beginning to return to normal.Prof Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia and an adviser to the WHO, says people often delay medical appointments over Christmas and schedule them for the new year, leading to a lull at the end of December but a spike in demand in early January.While he cautioned this impacts the daily data, as does the ongoing lateral flow test saga, he said cases did seem to be slowing nationwide.“The sort of biases that you\u0027d expect around people being less likely to go for testing over bank holidays would tend to underestimate the situation and so make the apparent drop possibly even more dramatic than it appears at the moment,” he told the .“I think it\u0027s beginning to look quite hopeful, but we\u0027ve been here in the past,” he said.“The worst case scenarios that were being talked about before Christmas by the SAGE modellers aren\u0027t coming to pass, fortunately.“In England we peaked at around 3,800 - 4,000 hospitalisations a day, on average, a year ago, but we will probably peak around 2,000 this winter.”Professor Kevin Fenton, Public Health England’s regional director for London, told Sky News that the capital’s omicron wave peaked in London over the new year period.He warned that ONS data suggested nearly one in 10 Londoners are still infected with the virus and the “critical phase” of the pandemic is not yet over.“We think we may have passed or are at the peak… and we’re seeing reductions in overall case rates across the city and the prevalence of infections within the community.”Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, the eminent statistician at the University of Cambridge who has penned a book on the pandemic, told Times Radio it is possible hospital admissions will stay below 3,000 a day, which has been set by Sage as an important marker.Overzealous models from December, when little was known about omicron, are not due to faulty science or pessimistic experts, but because the variant is less deadly and vaccine-evading than was feared when the models were made.For example, on Sunday it emerged that the Scottish Government had received new modelling showing daily infections would peak at around 70,000 on Thursday or Friday this week before tumbling to around 20,000 by the end of the month.This is far earlier than predictions made by Humza Yousaf, the Scottish Health Secretary, and Prof Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, who said the omicron tsunami would not peak until late January or early February.And while case numbers and hospitalisations show signs of dropping, both Prof Hunter and Prof Spiegelhalter believe vaccines are preventing intensive care wards, and therefore the NHS as a whole, from being overwhelmed.As of January 8, there are 708 people in England needing mechanical ventilation, the lowest it has been since October 18. A year ago, more than 3,000 people were on ventilators.“The reduction in intensive care unit beds will have a substantially greater impact on workload than case numbers dropping,” Prof Hunter said.“People in desperate need of a major surgical operation, whether it be brain tumour, coronary artery bypass grafts, cancer surgery, a lot of the time these people are going to go on into intensive care units for a short while before they can go back to the open ward.“Now, if all those beds are occupied by people with COVID then you can\u0027t do the heroic surgery.“If this fall in mechanical ventilation bed occupancy continues, that would be a huge reduction in work demand for nurses and doctors but also it would start to free up beds so we could go back to doing surgery on people with the most desperate need but can\u0027t have it done at the moment because of a lack of access to ventilation beds.”As a result of low numbers of Covid patients needing ventilation, there are now fewer people in critical care beds in England than at the same time in the previous five years.Official NHS England data show that on January 2 2022, there were 3,055 people in critical care beds in England, leaving a quarter of total critical care beds still available.On January 2 2021, there were 3,911 critical care beds filled out of an available 4,875 (80 per cent). In 2018, during a bad flu season, 3,270 of 3,704 critical care beds (88 per cent) were being used.“Intensive care is not under the sort of stress it was in the past, but there is still a completely disproportionate number of people in intensive care who are unvaccinated and it is vaccination which is saving us from total catastrophe,” Prof Spiegelhalter said.But he did warn that although cases may start coming down, it is unlikely to happen rapidly due to the high prevalence of infection.“It isn\u0027t going to come down quickly and it\u0027s going to be unbelievably tough for the NHS, particularly for staff absences,” he said.More from NewsNovak Djokovic latest news: Tennis star\u0026#39s Australian Open hopes in the balance as legal team prepare for visa appeal hearingBoris Johnson expected to face questions over No 10 garden partiesRishi Sunak backs call for Covid isolation to be cut to five daysBritain will ‘stand up to bullies’, declares Ben Wallace as he marks Falklands War anniversaryNHS told: send cancer patients to private hospitals so they can be treatedMinisters have a responsibility to lead the charge back to normalityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministers have responsibility lead charge back normality","story":"Spare a thought for Wes Streeting, the Shadow Health Secretary and rising star on the Labour benches. Before Christmas he demanded the Government introduce further Covid restrictions, insisting they were inevitable. After Christmas, when the worst fears about omicron did not come true, Streeting shared his relief that the Government had not brought in the very laws he had been demanding.The widely held view that the Government has performed poorly throughout the pandemic is not true. Certainly, when Covid first emerged, ministers were slow to lock down. When new variants emerged, and when we were unprotected by vaccines, they were also slow to restrict travel to Britain from affected countries and regions. The failures of the contact tracing programme and in the early procurement of protective equipment are well known.But even before the vaccines arrived, there were successes. Rishi Sunak kept businesses alive and families afloat with his extraordinary interventions. British science was responsible for genome sequencing and discovering novel treatments for Covid patients. With the vaccines, not only was Britain responsible for developing one of the most widely administered jabs in the world, the Government got its policies right in procuring them early and in huge numbers, authorising them for use promptly, and rolling them out efficiently.When case numbers increased, and ministers came under pressure in the media and from Labour to introduce tough new restrictions – first during the summer and then before Christmas – the Government held its nerve and, it seems, was vindicated on both occasions. The number of new Covid cases is now falling in London, the South East and East of England. The growth rate is falling dramatically in all other parts of England.Add to this the news that for anybody who has received their booster shot, the risk of hospitalisation from omicron is ninety per cent lower than for anybody who remains unvaccinated, there is reason to be positive about the future. Hospitals in some parts of the country remain under pressure, businesses and public services are having to cope with staff absences, and we must accept the risk of new variants emerging in future, but it is time to talk about how we can return to normality.There are many pressing reasons to do so. The economic and fiscal hits caused by Covid are considerable. The social consequences of lockdowns and restrictions are many, and some are not yet understood. Loneliness and isolation from society are storing up mental health problems. Millions of children, and not only from the poorest families, have experienced “learning loss” in schools. Already, signs of criminality and anti-social behaviour in urban areas are showing, and ministers and securocrats worry that the terror threat has grown as extremists have spent time at home online.This is not to argue against lockdowns or other restrictions in principle or in retrospect. Before the vaccines saved us, we had little option but to halt the spread of the virus by limiting our own social contact. The severity and duration of those lockdowns and restrictions might have been less if we had pursued other policy options or if the capability of the state had been greater. But to pretend that Britain could have avoided lockdowns and restrictions is the stuff of libertarian fantasy.In fact the pandemic has seen some previously sensible people on the Right take leave of their senses. What began as cries of pain about the loss of personal freedom, and understandable concern about the economic costs of lockdowns and restrictions, soon morphed, for some, into conspiracy theory and quackery. By attacking the pharmaceutical companies, undermining confidence in the vaccines, or making bizarre claims like “it has never been about the virus, it is about controlling us”, these Covid culture warriors have revealed that in the culture wars the Right can be the problem just as much as the Left.To make the case for returning to normality now is not to give succour to these paranoic arguments. For the vaccines, rapid mass testing and the availability of antiviral drugs – and of course the positive news about the reduced severity of Omicron – mean we are in a very different world now. As Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary and former Vaccines Minister, said yesterday, we should soon witness “the transition of the virus from pandemic to endemic.”As this occurs, there is a responsibility for ministers to promote, actively and energetically, a swift return to a normal way of life. We are better protected against the virus, but we will still need to coexist with it, so regular testing is likely to remain a function of day-to-day living for some time to come, and test kits will need to be free of charge well into the future. Despite the controversy of the misnamed “vaccine passports”, asking people to prove that they have tested negative or been vaccinated is also a small price to pay as we lift restrictions and live normally.Ministers should be prepared to cut the isolation period for people who have had Covid from seven to five days, where the patient tests negative. They should prohibit masks for children in schools and ban online lessons apart from in the most extreme circumstances. They should compel universities to teach courses in person. They should ensure the reopening of GP surgeries and prepare the NHS to begin the long, hard task of catching up with its backlogs. They should explore incentives for people to travel to city centres, work from offices, eat in restaurants and visit cultural sites like galleries and museums. They should run public awareness campaigns encouraging us to get on with our lives.Despite predictions from behavioural scientists that people would tire of abiding by Covid restrictions, the public has shown itself to be cautious and responsible throughout the pandemic. Whether it was the call to “stay at home”, or to “eat out to help out”, by and large people have responded positively to instructions, incentives and advice. Now we need ministers to lead us back on the road to normality. It is time to put the nightmare behind us.More from NewsFire in New York City apartment block leaves 19 dead, including nine childrenNovak Djokovic latest news: Tennis star\u0026#39s Australian Open hopes in the balance as legal team prepare for visa appeal hearingBoris Johnson expected to face questions over No 10 garden partiesRishi Sunak backs call for Covid isolation to be cut to five daysBritain will ‘stand up to bullies’, declares Ben Wallace as he marks Falklands War anniversaryNHS told: send cancer patients to private hospitals so they can be treatedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sunday church service attendance almost halves 30 years figures","story":"Sunday service attendance has nearly halved in 30 years, The  can reveal, as clergy warn that priests covering more than one parish has sparked a “loss of confidence” in the Church.The only area of the country to see an increase in the number of worshippers was London, where the diocese has stuck to the “one-priest-one-parish” model.All 43 other dioceses have seen an average decline of 40 per cent in the number of regular Sunday worshippers, a new analysis of Church of England data shows. Between 1987 and 2019 the number fell from around 1.2 million to 679,000. In London, over the same time period, churchgoers increased from 52,700 to 53,600 - an increase of 1.7 per cent.Priests in rural areas are increasingly being asked to deliver services at several towns and villages in the community, with some using lay people instead of clergy due to shortages.Responding to the data, Rev Marcus Walker, who founded the Save the Parish campaign, said: “London, many decades ago, decided to buck the trend in the rest of the Church of England and stick to a one-priest-one-parish model. The fruits of this can now be seen.”He added: “There has been a loss of confidence in the core claims of Christianity - both in the nation and in the church.“If we want to bring people back to church first we have to win people back to the God they would worship in our churches. For that we need theologically-trained priests, embedded in their communities, with the time to know and love the people they serve.”The new data come at a time when there are warnings that the church could collapse in rural communities as many struggle to attract congregations and funds.A leaked Church document last year suggested the Covid pandemic was an opportunity for radical change which could result in the loss of the parish church model in a bid to remain “financially sustainable”. It warned clergy to prepare for changes and cuts as officials prepare to overhaul the system, sparking fears that churches in rural towns and parishes will not survive.There is also an ongoing debate about the future of the Church as it tries to attract more Christians in an increasingly secular society.The diocese which saw the biggest drop in the number of churchgoers between 1987 and 2019 was Durham, with the figure falling from 26,800 to 10,900 - a decline of 59.3 per cent. This was closely followed by the Diocese of Liverpool whose churchgoers fell by 55.7 per cent, from 35,000 to 15,500 over the same period.Two dioceses saw a small increase in the number of usual Sunday churchgoers between 2018 and 2019.The Diocese of Coventry saw its number of regular Sunday worshippers increase from 11,100 to 11,200 and the diocese of Worcester also saw an average increase of 100 Sunday worshippers, taking its total to 8,900.Meanwhile, the Diocese of Leeds was created in April 2014, after the dioceses of Bradford, Ripon, Leeds, Sheffield and Wakefield were merged. The number of usual Sunday worshippers for this diocese in 1987 - before the merger - was 50,000. However, by 2019, this figure fell to just 25,200.The Ven Luke Miller, Archdeacon of London, said the reason that the capital has seen an increase is because “churches have seen significant growth where they have engaged with communities in new and creative ways, often responding to local needs and changing demand”.He added: “While experiences will differ locally, broader societal changes over time have affected people’s patterns of life, whether it be in their work, their leisure and family time, or in how they practice their faith.“To compare church service attendance with historical data oversimplifies and overlooks the other ways in which our churches have been changing and responding. Sunday services continue to be an important part of parish life, but Church today reaches people in so many ways. The pandemic has shone a light on this evolution.”The  recently revealed that more than 400 churches have been shut down in less than a decade.Further analysis revealed that almost 1,000 have been forced to close in just over 30 years - 940 between 1987 and 2019.

Close contact with others – especially in unventilated spaces – increases your chances of spreading Covid-. If you’re spending the festive season with loved ones there are lots of ways you can reduce the risk, including taking regular rapid lateral flow tests, letting fresh air in and getting your booster. GP Dr Claire Ashley provides some simple tips for staying safe so you and those close to you can gather round the table and enjoy your Christmas fun. Take those tests  Meeting up with loved ones  You should all do a rapid lateral flow test before you mingle.They’re free, easy to do at home and the results show in half an hour – to order a pack, go to nhs.uk get-tested.“If you haven’t got any symptoms, rapid lateral flow tests are very good at picking up Covid-,” says Dr Ashley, based in the South West. “On Christmas morning, before granny comes over for lunch, taking a test is the best way to check you’re not infectious. “My family will all have a rapid lateral flow test the morning we travel down to see my parents, andanything comes back positive, or any of us has symptoms, we won’t go. “I’m aware our plans might be disrupted. It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Pepe Di’Iasio’s school in Yorkshire has more than  leaks in the roof, leaving his pupils “cold and wet”. As we launch Levelling up Watch, Mr Di’Iasio said: “Words are cheap, actions speak louder than words.”Mr Di’Iasio dreads the rain. Dreads it because the school roof leaks and staff will be running around classrooms to place buckets to catch the water. It’s just one more problem in a Covid-hit educational world that has caused such anxiety for his pupils that some have turned up drunk for lessons, while others have been traumatised by domestic violence. The school has used all its cash reserves putting support in place. Di’Iasio says: “We’ve done our best to try to prioritise people, not spend money on bricks and mortar.” But the -year-old building is in desperate need of investment.  The clapped-out drains are collapsing, there are cracks in windows caused by subsidence, water comes through the flat roof in at least  places, and the technology building has been closed because it is in such a state. Site manager Martin Smith gives us a tour of Wales High School near Sheffield, South Yorks, and says: “It’s just a nightmare, we’re forever mopping up.” We stop to chat to two caretakers, one has  keys hanging on a chain around his neck as the locks have not been upgraded since the school opened in . The caretakers are fixing a huge fan heater and, with a sigh, one explains: “It’s broken again. Everything is just tired out.”  There are , pupils, aged  to , at the school, where carpets are stained from the leaks and ceiling tiles are missing where caretakers burst them to release the build-up of water. Science teachers were furious last term when water came through and destroyed crucial coursework. But despite the struggles, Mr Di’Iasio and the caretakers could not be more proud of their secondary school and their “amazing” pupils. The devotion of the staff is clear – during lockdown, the kitchen staff and cleaners repainted the whole school. It may not be pretty, but Wales High School, rated “Good” by Ofsted, is so popular parents fight to get their kids places, with at least  appeals every year when admission is refused.  The school tries to keep up with this demand, even converting staff toilets to classrooms. Head of School, Lisa McCall lost half her office to accommodate students. She says: “I can hear the lesson next door and I have to whisperdiscussing anything confidential because of the thin partition.” Mr Di’Iasio invited the Mirror into the school to show how desperately funding is needed. He has seen no sign of the promised levelling up or extra money for schools. He says: “It’s hard to believe we are in the world’s sixth-largest economy. Levelling up is supposed to be the big idea of Boris Johnson’s government.When he was elected in  he pledged to spread opportunity to every corner of the UK. But two years later we are still waiting for the Prime Minister to deliver on his promises. A White Paper setting out the Government’s plan was supposed to have been published this month but has now been shelved until the new year.Many are starting to question whether Mr Johnson is genuinely committed to spreading wealth and opportunity orlevelling up is just an empty slogan. That is why the Mirror is today launching Levelling Up Watch. We intend to hold the Government to account over its plans to improve schools, communities, education and transport. We also want to see any additional money distributed fairly and not just to seats the Tories need to retain to stay in power. What is clear is tinkering with the structure of local government and sprinkling money on piecemeal transport schemes will not be enough. The regional inequality in Britain is not only deep and engrained, it has become starker since the Conservatives came to power in . During that period more than , Sure Start Centres have closed, local councils have seen their funding cut by more than % and the budgets for public health and education have been badly squeezed. The National Audit Office found that since , funding in the most deprived fth of schools fell in real terms by .%, while funding in the fth least deprived schools rose by .%. The additional money announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his Budget will onlyper pupil funding to  levels. People in poorer areas are likely to have worse health and shorter le expectancy but the budget for Public Health England in - is % – £billion – lower in real terms than in -. Nor can it be right that - transport spending was £ per capita in London, compared to £ in the North East and £ in Yorkshire and Humber. We have heard plenty of words from Mr Johnson about his ambitions to level up but the time for rhetoric is over. We need to see some action.  “We are in a s building and as we speak the rain is pouring down. “I have no doubt that we will have more than five or six dferent leaks, with buckets in classrooms, by the end of the day. We are in a school where children will be cold and wet. “This at a time when we are keeping windows open to allow airflow to prevent the spread of Covid, and the heating is working overtime to keep the temperature at a level you can work and learn in. “Our site staff are brilliant at trying to make do and mend, but the building is creaking and when it rains the flat roof leaks. It has been patched up as much as it possibly can be. “The building is not really fit for purpose and the environment can have a massive impact on learning.”  Mr Di‘Iasio is also dealing with the impact of Covid on his pupils’ mental health. He says: “We are dealing with the fallout from that from a large number of students on a daily basis. “Initially when the students came back they were just so happy to be back, but then things changed and they started exhibiting more extremes of behaviour than we had before. “We had students turning up with alcohol, being under the influence. “We had students who had the police in the house overnight dealing with incidents of domestic violence and we’ve had incidents where students have been suffering from the pressure of the exam process.  “We have spent our money making sure we keep our staff and have enough people to support the students. “There is more money now invested in mental health support and wellbeing.” The school stayed open the first week of the Christmas holidays so pupils could get hot meals. All of the school’s reserves, £,, have now gone. Mr Di‘Iasio says: “The students make the job worthwhile, they make every day a happy day. But it’s when you are looking at the budget and having to make really tough decisions about whether to keep that counsellor or that classroom assistant. They are the darkest days. “But we love our school.” About levelling up, Mr Di‘Iasio says: “I am massively in favour of the concept, but words are cheap and actions speak louder than words. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have invested £. billion since  to enable schools to refurbish their buildings, including £. billion in - alone.On top of this, our new ten-year School Rebuilding Programme to transform  schools is underway and will improve the education of tens of thousands of children as we level up across the UK.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationSchoolsMental healthSecondary schoolLevelling Up Watch\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He added: Weaposve heard this before from the Government, so weaposre not surprised. We are not too impressed. We still believe itaposs not very helpful that we keep agitating the issue of Article . I think what we should focus on - at least thataposs where we are focused on - is trying to find solutions for dficulties in the implementation of the protocol.The Foreign Secretary was handed responsibility for the negotiations after Lord Frost resigned as Brexit minister last month.Writing in the Sunday , she said it is her absolute priority to resolve the unintended consequences created by the protocol to maintain peace in Northern Ireland. In an explosive intervention, Lord Frost told Mr Johnson that he must commit to a low-tax free market economy or risk losing the next general election. The PMaposs former key ally issued the warning in his first interview since quitting last month, as he raised concerns against the Tories polling against Labour. Lord Frost said the Conservatives need to focus on rebuilding the nation and be proud of our history.He told the Mail on Sunday: We need to get the country going economically again and that means free markets, free debate and low taxes.

We have to make plans for every outcome, thataposs the responsible thing to do, Mr Zahawi told BBC Sunday Morning. I have to have contingency plans for , , , % absenteeism because obviously Omicron is far more infectious. He said the vaccine rollout for  to -year-olds needed to go much faster after the Government missed its target to jab the majority of younger teens by the October half term. Only around half of this age group have had the jab, Mr Zahawi said. We have to go much, much faster which is why we are going back into schools on Monday with the school age vaccination programme, he said. The Cabinet Minister said Covid would eventually become endemic and people would live with the virus. But he added: The next two weeks will be bumpy as staff absenteeism will rise as students go back into education. On the whole, this has been a good start last week. This week will be important. He also backed calls for the Covid self-isolation period to be cut to five daysexperts deem it safe, in order to ease staff shortages.

The snap survey found the majorityof heads had pupils absent due to Covid, while nearly a thirdreported over % of children were out of class because of the virus. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of NAHT, said: “Schools are doing everything they can to maintain education for pupils in the face of very challenging circumstances. Staff absence on the first day of term was considerable and could very likely rise as the term progresses.” Mr Zahawi also insisted that exams would go ahead this summer, with more details to come next month on the measures needed to make assessments fair for pupils. He said: My absolute commitment is that exams are going ahead both this January and for the summer, for GCSEs and A-levels, but weaposre putting in mitigations to make sure that we recognise who have had their education disruption.

Today the Daily Mirror takes a detailed look at le in areas the Conservatives claim they now care about. The picture is bleak, with little or no progress since Boris Johnson won an -seat majority at the  General Election. Over-promising and under-delivering is a hallmark of this Prime Minister. The rundown school we highlight today, where heroic teachers and other staff struggle to keep going in crumbling buildings, is unfortunately not an exception. Working people deserve better and the pupils deserve an education in fit-for-purpose facilities. But in this country Government policies are levelling us down instead of up. Staff our NHS  With an understaffed NHS on its knees, axing key staff because they are unvaccinated would be self-destructive. The boss of one of London’s busiest hospitals warning as many as % of his workforce could need moving shows what happens when the tricky real world collides with Whitehall diktat. Of course, those in the health service should be jabbed, to protect patients, colleagues and the public as well as themselves. Yet the no jab, no job order could prove ruinous to the provision of healthcare. Daily pre-work tests are expensive and burdensome but it would surely be better to use them than to lose the skills and expertise of people who, for whatever reason, have failed to get inoculated, or chosen not to.

Ashfield MP Lee Anderson was recently criticised for telling a female district councillor in his constituency to “stay out of big boy’s politics”. The Tories appointed him to the committee in May last year, despite having reprimanded him over sexist behaviour. But after just six months on the committee, he was quietly replaced in mid-December by former equalities minister Caroline Dineage. Mr Anderson has not publicly addressed his stepping back from the committee, and did not respond to a request for comment. Commons records show he left the Committee on December . Mr Anderson made headlines during the Euro  tournament for announcing he would not watch England matches because he did not like “the taking the knee business.” Mr Anderson was “warned” by Conservative party in  over a Facebook post while he was a Councillor.Alongside a picture of a woman wearing a low-cut tank top, Mr Anderson wrote: “Out with some great knockers tonight in Skegby.” In November, he sparked fury in his local constituency by telling Ashfield District Councillor Samantha Deakin to “stay out of big boy’s politics.” Cllr Deakin had criticised Mr Anderson in a row about a local college. “Like many people, Lee Anderson’s appointment to the Women’s and Equality Select Committee was a surprise to me,” she said. “ More than that - it was an insult. Since then, I have been a victim of his misogyny.” She added: “We asked the Conservative Party last year whether his current membership of this important committee was appropriate – they didn’t reply. “It’s clear however that someone has agreed and this Select Committee can now get on with their job without the influence of someone with the views of a s Working Men’s Club comedian.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lee AndersonConservative PartyThe EuroPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Education Secretary rejected Labouraposs plans for a one-off windfall tax on the fossil fuel firms to help support consumers claiming they donapost add up. Mr Zahawi, a former oil industry advisor, claimed the rise in the national living wage would help people cope with rising energy costs which are set to add hundreds of pounds to average bills. The biggest British energy firms, BP and Shell, raked in £.bn in three months last year and the boss of BP has called the market a cash machine. Mr Zahawi told LBC: I was a businessman before I entered Parliament and I can tell you what Labour are putting out just doesnapost add up.  A windfall tax on oil and gas companies, who are already struggling in the North Sea, is never going to cut it.He said the Government had poured £.million into helping those most in need - and said looming National Insurance hike was a progressive way to raise funds for the NHS and social care.But Shadow Financial Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said: Rather than supporting hard-working people facing huge energy bill rises, Government ministers are pleading poverty on behalf of oil companies who are enjoying record profits.” Labour would impose a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to fund measures to ease the cost of living squeeze, by reducing the average household energy bill by £.The £.bn plan would include removing VAT on domestic energy bills for a whole year, as well as expanding and increasing the warm homes discount for those most at risk. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves blamed ministers for creating a “price crisis” by responding to surging wholesale energy costs with “dither and delay”.  Under Labouraposs plan, fossil fuel giants would be forced to contribute £.bn to help fund the proposals, through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of %. Ms Reeves told Sky: The Prime Minister was the biggest advocate for cutting VAT on gas and electricity bills during the European referendum. But now when cutting those bills would make more dference than ever, the Prime Minister says no. The Shadow Chancellor said thatnow was not the time to cut VAT on energy bills then frankly I donapost know when is. She added: Bills canapost be paid on broken promises.

And ignore sleaze, corruption, back-handers, unfairness, inequality and fatal mistakes for, with the blessing of Culture Wars Secretary Nadine Dorries, Tory no-mark Andrew Rosindell wants the BBC to play God Save the Queen every day. Statues, flags and anthems are battlegrounds the PM’s smokescreen to ert public attention away from his tax hikes, soaring fuel bills, cost of living rises, stagnant wages and declining public services.  It is a classic, cynical Right-wing strategy to ide and rule. It played well in the past and it might work again. Magicians use misdirection as a form of deception to draw the audience’s attention from the real action. Johnson would rather voters were angry about a jury clearing four protesters over the toppling of slaver Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol than holding the PM to account for increased National Insurance or discussing Labour’s proposed windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to compensate households who are facing huge increases in energy bills. Suella Braverman is an Attorney-General whose ideological conviction results in much of the legal profession judging her guilty of stupidity. Even considering an appeal against the jury verdict in the Colston case is a sign the governing party will roll in the gutter. Labour leader Keir Starmer is wise to take no lectures on patriotism from a Conservative regime which inflicted the terrible national self-harm that is Brexit. But in a fight, the Labour leader is similarly wise to combat smears which saw predecessor Jeremy Corbyn unfairly tainted as hating his country. Labour wins by keeping the national conversation on big issues that really count, the Tories by changing it to emblems and frippery.

Tara Trethowan, , describes running her independent bridal wear shop, The Bridal Studio in Cornwall, as aposmore of a vocationapos than a job, putting love into everything she does. But after discovering a letter on November , Tara was shocked to find it was a handwritten four-page rant, lashing out at nearly every aspect of her business, including comparing the walls to prison cell grey and flowers from a graveyard. The confused mum-of-three who has been running the shop since  posted the note on social media in a bid to find the anonymous critic, with many soon coming to the business owners defence online.  Tara said: Itaposs pretty ridiculous. Usually when we get letters they are from brides with a photograph of them in their dress thanking us for helping them. We didnapost really know what to make of it and at first thought it was maybe a bit of a joke. We donapost usually get handwritten letters, it was a bit of a shock.If somebody felt aggrieved by our windows and they were so upset about it then why didnapost they sign the letter, e-mail us or write a Google review. At first I was disappointed to think that somebody felt like that about us because I put a lot of effort and love into what I do. I havenapost got a clue who wrote the letter, thataposs the million-dollar question. The note goes on to describe Taraaposs shop as uninspiring and unattractive and wasting a prime high street position with thoughtless displays, as well as suggesting Tara doesnapost care about her brides. Throughout the nameless author aggressively tries to advise what they think she should do with the displays, encouraging her to go to other bridal boutiques, dress the mannequins instead of dumping the gowns on them, and tells her to buy decorations from The Range.  The anonymous writer said the letter was dficult to write and that Taraaposs displays should be full of joy. Tara added: It isnapost a job, itaposs like a vocation really. I love what we do and feel very privileged to be able to help brides find their dress. So to get a letter like that my first thoughts were aposwow, god Iaposve really upset somebodyapos. But as itaposs gone on Iaposm thinking that it was somebody whoaposs got a bit too much time on their hands and I got it in the neck for whatever reason. Everybody has an opinion and itaposs all subjective but Iaposm genuinely keen to know what drove them to write it.  Now however the writer of the scathing note has come under fire themselves after Taraaposs social media post racked up more than , likes, with many condemning the letter. One person said the letter was an absolute load of b*******. Sam Jane wrote: I despair of the human race sometimes. So bloody rude and thoughtless. Christine Woods said: Oh my goodness, this beggars belief. Everyone has an opinion but why not put your name on it. Charlotte Emily White commented: This is literally so savage, uncalled for and inaccurate. This person is a k*ob And Judith Oliver weighed and said: I look forward to seeing your windows whenever Iaposm in or passing through Helston.

The married couple bought the used Peugeot Boxer for just £, from ebay and spent a further £, doing it up. Natasha and Vinny then embarked on a whirlwind tour across Europe where Pippa strolled through Valencia city centre, hiked in En Xativa, Spain, drank fresh water in Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland, chased kites in La Manga and sunbathed in Benalmadena, Spain. Natasha, , said: “It felt so liberating being able to go everywhere and anywhere we like.

Millions of -to--year-olds have the option of taking up a second jab from tomorrow as efforts are increased prevent the spread of Omicron iant.But  per cent of that age group in England have yet to sign-up for a first dose since the Covid jab was offered to them in late September.Among -to--year-olds the figure is slightly better, so the reasons why youngsters are not signing up is not clear.But vaccines have been linked to very rare cases of myocarditis, where muscles in the heart become inflamed causing chest pain, breathlessness, a pounding pulse and nausea.The condition can develop after a viral infection such as flu and the heart is aposinjuredapos by Covid or by the immune system’s reaction to it.  Men are more likely to be affected by myocarditis than women as the male hormone testosterone hampers cells in the body which can reduce inflammation. Dr Mohiddin, consultant cardiologist at Barts Heart Centre in London said: There’s a striking predisposition to myocarditis in younger men, which may be to do with their higher levels of hormones They usually develop heart problems about  days or so after viral infection, but in  per cent of cases it’s mild and they make a complete recovery. Myocarditis has been linked to very rare cases in the Pfizer jab among teens and the Moderna jab as a booster in over-s. But there is no evidence that the Oxford- AstraZeneca vaccine triggers it. Sir Chris Whitty announced plans in the autumn to vaccinate teenagers and said there was only a marginal benefit in health terms They were offered the jab to keep schools open as much as possible and prevent disruption to pupils’ education. Scientists from Edinburgh and Oxford universities last month found that for every million second doses of the Pfizer given to those aged  to  in the UK, there were three cases of myocarditis. Health experts say Covid vaccine risks of myocarditis are small. Dr Mohiddin told the Daily Mail : My message to worried parents would be that the risks from teenagers not being vaccinated are greater than being vaccinated – even with milder Omicron in circulation.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which monitors drug safety in the UK, there were  reports of myocarditis in all age groups following the Pfizer jab up to December m, but it led to four deaths It adds: The majority of fatal reports describe underlying illnesses in these patients that could provide an alternative explanation. Under-s should wait at least  weeks after having Covid infection to have a first or second vaccine government advice says. But the risk of heart problems could be highera teenage boy catches the virus without knowing and shows no symptoms Doctors say it’s impossible to say but any increase in risk would be small and myocarditis would be very mild.

But sceptical experts said this is unlikely to be the case - with a World Health Organisation scientist emphatically stating Deltacron is not real. Imperial College virologist Dr Tom Peacock is among the experts saying the anomaly appears to be quite clearly contamination as it does not meet the criteria for a new iant.And World Health OrganisationCovid expert Dr Krutika Kuppalli posted on Twitter : Deltacron is not real and is likely due to sequencing artact .Let’s not merge of names of infectious diseases and leave it to celebrity couples.  The response from the scientic community came after Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, said his team had discovered  Covid samples which appeared to combine the Delta and Omicron strains. He told reporters: There are currently omicron and delta co-infections and we found this strain that is a combination of these two. It sparked a huge response on social media, with Deltacron trending for much of the weekend, but experts are not convinced. Dr Peacock wrote in response: The Cypriot aposDeltacronapos sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination - they do not cluster on a phylogenetic tree and have a whole Artic primer sequencing amplicon of Omicron in an otherwise Delta backbone.  In a y Twitter thread debunking the iant, he said: Delta sequences with strange mutations in amplicon  have been turning up for ageshowever, they always show this non-monophyletic pattern and are nearly always more easily explained by this primer issue exacerbating very low-level contam.Global health expert Dr Boghuma Kabisen Titanji posted on Twitter: On the #Deltacron story, just because I have been asked about it many times in the last h, please interpret with caution. The information currently available is pointing to contamination of a sample as opposed to true recombination of #Delta and #Omicron iants.She added: The best thing we can do besides worrying about it and coining iant names that sound like a Transformers villain, is ensuring that vaccines are available to everyone and combining vaccination with other strategies that give the virus fewer opportunities to spread. Prof Martin Michaelis, Professor of Molecular Medicine at the University of Kent, told The Mirror that it is not yet clear whether the samples are real, or the rest of a sequencing error or contamination.He said: As far as I can tell, researchers from Cyprus have sequenced samples of SARS-CoV-, the coronavirus that causes COVID-, and received genomic sequences that combine features of the Omicron and Delta iants.It is not yet clear whether this is real or a sequencing error or the consequence of contamination. If dferent viruses from dferent SARS-CoV- iants are analysed on the same machines, you can get sequences that look asthey are from a new virus but are in reality just a mixture of dferent viruses. Hence, we have to wait for what further investigations will show. In any case, Deltacron is not an official name. But he warned thattwo viruses infect the same cell, there is potential for strains to combine - meaning a hybrid iant is formed. Prof Michaelis continued: Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV- have in principle the ability to recombine their genetic materialtwo viruses infect the same cell. Therefore, it is possible thatsomeone is simultaneously infected with an Omicron and a Delta iant virus that new hybrid viruses emerge that carry a new combination of the features of the two original viruses. With high levels of Omicron and Delta transmission at the same time, such hybrid viruses may be formed at some point.

Protesters today demonstrated outside Cardf Bay police station, where Mohamud Mohammed Hassan, , was taken on January  last year. Mr Hassan, who was due to become a dad, was released the following morning but died the next day. He ed home that day battered and bruised after being assaulted by police officers during his time in custody. So far six members of South Wales Police, four officers and two custody sergeants have been served misconduct notices.  A post-mortem examination failed to establish the cause of Mr Hassanaposs death. An inquest into his death will be held at South Wales Central Coroneraposs Court in Pontypridd in May. Meanwhile, an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conductis still underway. Now his family has called for honesty and answers. They say they believe both the police force and IOPC have conspired to cover up, obscure, frustrate, delay and dispute their search for the truth. They ask that the video footage from Mr Hassanaposs night in the cells be released immediately.  The IOPC has refused to release it in case it may be needed as evidence for criminal, misconduct or inquest proceedings. The family said in a statement: We have repeatedly requested that the IOPC provide the family and our legal team access to the video showing the final hours of Mohamudaposs le. Despite our repeated requests, the family have been consistently denied access by the IOPC. Had the footage of Mohamudaposs last moments been released to us, then we would have been spared the slow torturous agony of consistently speculating day by day on precisely what happened to him that awful night. We believe that all families of those that die in suspicious circumstances in police custody should have an automatic right enshrined in law to get immediate access to police bodycam footage showing exactly what happened during their final moments on this earth.  In stark contrast, we see in the US, after a death in police custody, police bodycam videos being released on demand to families in the immediate aftermath of such incidents. One year on from the untimely and suspicious death of our beloved family member we remain in shock at the treatment we received from IOPC throughout the last year. Six Cardf police officers are now under investigation and the only reason we believe that happened was due to our relentless questioning of the police version of events. Several Black Lives Matter protests and vigils were held outside Cardf Bay police station in the months that followed Mr Hassanaposs death. The family are being backed by Shavanah Taj, general secretary of the Wales TUC, who said: Given historical allegations of institutional racism levelled at South Wales Police and other recent cases of police brutality, we need to ensure that the investigation is subjected to independent legal scrutiny, supported by independent expert witnesses. Zita Holbourne, national chairwoman and co-founder of Black Activists Rising Against Cuts, added: Itaposs a national scandal that a year on the Hassan family have no idea how Mohamud died, and yet both the IOPC and South Wales Police have had unrestricted access to this footage. Itaposs utterly unacceptable, and the attorney general should instruct the IOPC to release the police bodycam footage immediately. Campaign spokesman Lee Jasper said: The release of this footage should be a matter of human rights and families should be given unrestricted access to police bodycam footage. We call on the public to support this critical demand.

Spokesperson for the French Government, Gabriel Attal, acknowledged that the news would come as relief for many looking to visit France on a working capacity after the list of compelling reasons, notably professional was extended.But many tourists are still waiting to hear when the rules will be changed for them, after the French government imposed the strict ban on December . It states that all arrivals must have an essential reason to travel to, or come from, the UK, both for the unvaccinated and vaccinated. Initially the list of essential reasons did not include leisure travel or professional reasons, but the latest move has re-introduced the latter as an appropriate purpose of journey. Britain is now also taking steps to make travelling easier, including removal of some pre and post departure tests for arrivals in the UK. Vaccinated passengers no longer need to take a test before they leave for for the UK as of Friday and from am today, vaccinated travellers can take a much cheaper and more convenient lateral flow test rather than the previous day  PCR required.  The changes to these rules do not apply for unvaccinated passengers. The isolation rule has also been scrapped for passengers with a full vaccination passport, meaning they can travel freely as soon as they land, provided their lateral flow isnapost positive. In this case, they will be asked to take a PCR test to confirm the positive result and self isolate immediately. Brits are still banned from a number of countries and remain on the red list of others, including Cyprus. It is still possible to travel to a number of countries, but many of these have made it signicantly easier for vaccinated passengers, such as in Spain, Italy and Germany, where they can enter without self isolation by proving their vaccine status.  Other countries still maintain mandatory pre-departure tests, such as Portugal and Greece as well as the US - but unvaccinated passengers cannot enter the States at all. In New Zealand the strict Managed Isolation Quarantine rules remain and passengers cannot travel to the country without a aposcritical reasonapos. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern did consider the idea of ditching the intense MIQ system currently operating in Aotearoa, however, the rapid spread of the Omicron iant has shelved any plans for a more lenient system to replace it in the immediate future.

Under plans reportedly being weighed up by officials, the tests could soon only be available in high-risk settings such as care homes, hospitals and schools. Boris Johnson is said to be poised to announce the move as part of the Governmentaposs strategy for living with the virus.However government sources have disputed the report and said it is too early to say what will happen with the tests, while Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said there were absolutely not any plans to do scrap them currently.The move would also see the NHS Test and Trace service scaled back, according to The Sunday Times.A Whitehall source told the newspaper: “I don’t think we are in a world where we can continue to hand out free lateral flow tests to everybody forevermore. It’s likely we will move to a scenario where there is less testing but where we have a capacity to ramp it upnecessary, such as in the winter.”  The Mirror has contacted the Department of Health for comment. Mr Zahawi said on Sunday that he was slightly puzzled by the report. Askeduniversal free lateral flows would be scrapped, he told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips on Sunday: This is absolutely not where we are at. For January alone,  million lateral flow tests coming in and they will continue to be available for free. I donapost really recognise where that story is coming from. Pressed on whether there were plans to begin charging for lateral flow tests, he said: Absolutely not.It comes days after the PM announced that from next week people who test positive on a lateral flow test will no longer be required to confirm their condition with a PCR testthey have no symptoms.After the rule change on Tuesday, people who test positive with no symptoms - said to account for around % of people with Covid - will no longer need this follow-up PCR test.They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.A decision to scrap free lateral flow tests would happen at a time when Covid cases reach record levels, with nearly . million confirmed infections in the past week across the UK. The Office for National Statisticsestimates that one in  people had the virus in the final week of  in England - with Wales and Scotland not far behind with one in  and Northern Ireland with one in . Although the number of people being treated in hospital with Covid has risen to its highest level in months - the number requiring ventilation is at its lowest since October last year. Scientists say increasing evidence shows that the Omicron iant causes less severe illness. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Modelling group, told Times Radio: “The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new iant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. It’s very similar to the common cold that we’ve lived with for many years. “We’re not quite there yet but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term. It is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonNursing homesPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pricey package was for saloon racing champ Gary Pebble and contained hundreds of pounds worth of vital spare parts for his Honda Civic EG racing car. Gary even forked out extra to ensure they were securely shipped from Southampton to his Worcestershire-based Reyland Motorsport business. They were delivered on the Bank Holiday Monday at the start of this month when his business was shut for the day.  But rather than taking the package back to schedule a redelivery, Gary later found out when he checked the proof of delivery that the Hermes driver signed for the delivery himself with an indistinct “squiggle”. The driver took a photo as proof of “delivery”, then hops in his vehicle and drives away. To make matters worse, the next day Garyaposs CCTV cameras showed a blue Fortress Recycling truck arrive to collect the rubbish.  But it was not until the following day that Gary realised something was wrong when he chased up the delivery on the car components. He checked his CCTV, and learned the worst. He told the Sun : Watching that video was just soul-destroying.It was worth about £ but it was vital to measure the new part I paid £, for.  Gary now needs to order a new component and mechanic Martin Hadland will need to start the job from scratch – leaving Gary in danger of not being ready for the start of the new season. I have had to order a new part and hope it arrives in time and is fitted before the season starts, he said. Hopefully it will be here, but it is just so annoying. A spokesperson for Hermes said: We are already in contact with the customer and are dealing with the issues. The Mirror has contacted Hermes for further comment.

Bebe, a dachshund, was found on a ledge just a few feet above the deep water having survived a ft fall. The two-year-old had gone missing, along with six-month-old Lulu, and sparked a major pet hunt when the duo became separated from their owner, Melanie Kermeen. Lulu managed to find her way home, but Melanie only found Bebe when she heard her frightened yelps from the bottom of the pit. But as she waited for help to arrive, retired cop and open swimmer Juan Kinley jumped into the icy waters to rescue Bebe. The dramatic rescue was captured on video and showed the moment when the -year-old former Isle of Man DCI swam over to the pooch and help her back to safety. Melanie, , said she was lucky that someone like Juan was nearby to help rescue her terried dog. She said: “There have been tragic stories where dogs get lost, so it was just a harrowing  hours. “But the way it ended was quite spectacular, and her fall down off the ledge was quite miraculous. “We’re just really, really lucky that we had someone like Juan with us, with his capabilities, because she was looking like she was going to jump in the more distressed she was getting.” Bebe and Lulu have previously been known to run off to chase rabbits in the fields surrounding her smallholding, but when they did notfor several hours, Melanie began to panic. Following frantic social media appeals and a local search that went on late into the night, exhausted Lulu arrived back at her door in the early hours of the next morning. But it wasn’t until the search party ventured close to a local quarry some hours later that they heard Bebe’s tiny bark and knew that she was also still alive. Melanie said: “I was shouting to her, and I actually heard her yelp, so I knew she was alive, which by then was  hours from her being away. “She must have fallen  foot down onto this ledge, just four or five foot above the water. “This water is very deep – . metres deep. She was amazingly lucky to have fallen down there.” Melanie called the emergency services for help and was waiting for a fire safety officer to arrive. But with Bebe becoming ever more distressed, five-time Iron Man veteran Juan decided to embark on the daring rescue mission himself by swimming over to save her. Melanie said: “He just jumped off and launched in, but he’s quite used to open water swimming. “He’s the chair of the triathlon club over here and organises lots of those type of things, and he’s done five ‘Iron Mans’, so he’s fairly tough. “He swam about  metres to Bebe and checkedshe was all right. She was delighted to see him. “She didn’t seem to be hurt, so he picked her up and made the swim back, which was pretty tough as by that time it was pretty cold. “She was trying to help with her little doggy paddle, which was just scratching his face and eyes and chest.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON West CoastSwimmingAnimalsDogsRescue\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They started requesting to be served by “the duchess” and taking pictures.It made me think, “Why not try and do something with this ” So I googled lookalike casting agencies – and was immediately signed up.Four days later I got my first “Kate” job – at Gatwick Airport for the  London Olympics. I was clueless, but I did what the photographer suggested – and loved it.As a single mum at the time, I didn’t believe at first that you could make a living from it.But by  I was able to quit my job and make “being Kate” my full-time career. It wasn’t just the money – crucially it meant spending more time with my children. Being self-employed gives me freedom.  The wages depend on the job – sometimes it’s a -minute job, sometimes it’s all day. So it can be hundreds of pounds – or thousands. There was no training, I just studied her mannerisms and voice, and practised her waving in the mirror. I buy replica clothing from China, around £-£ per Kate outfit, choosing memorable ones, such as the Issa engagement dress that she’s worn several times. I have some LK Bennett clothes, but £ is my top budget per item.I blow-dry my own hair and have mastered the classic, natural make-up Kate prefers. But in real le I’m a jeans and sweatshirt, messy bun kind of person. When Kate had a fringe cut, so did I – and absolutely hated it. I think she did too because it hasn’t made a comeback since. For her pregnancies I wore a fake bump, and ate a bit more cake, it was great. Kate has an enviable figure, so it’s hard work staying in similar shape, especially without her personal trainers and palace swimming pool.  I’m only ft in whereas Kate is ft in, but with heels people don’t notice. After  years I’ve got the hang of it. I work a lot with a Prince William lookalike, Simon Watkinson. We’re friends and people seem disappointed we’re not an actual couple in real le.Every day I keep abreast of Kate’s movements. Just recently I watched a video of her at awith schoolchildren – she was wearing a pink Hobbs coat.If I don’t know where her clothing is from, social media is helpful for tips because a Kate fan will always know the answer.I’ve clocked up hundreds of appearances as Kate and travelled to Australia, Hong Kong and New York.No two days are the same. I’d never have had these experiencesit wasn’t for her. The most bizarre job was at Madame Tussauds, standing in place of the waxwork then jumping out and scaring people! I often get stopped for selfies and mistaken for the duchess and – scarily – I’ve been followed home once. Dealing with internet trolls was the hardest – saying they hate the royals and I don’t look like Kate – but I’ve learnt to just shrug it off. Once, someone posted a death threat, but Facebook quickly dealt with it and the agency I’m signed to vets clients. I’m very careful, I’d never jog around London in full make-up, drawing attention to myself.As Kate turns  I hope she continues championing things such as mental health and child development. She’s become more confident, giving more speeches and wearing bolder colours.I’m a year older than her and my advice to Kate is to just enjoy turning . The Jubilee year will be a good time for her – and me – to shine. Hopefully, there’s longevity in this job and I’ll be Queen one day. If I ever did get to met her I’d probably just wave and say hello. My husband Russ has known me since high school. He’s proud of me but he never comments on whether he fancies the real Kate. After work he’ll just say, “How was your day ” I’ll say, “Great” and that’s that. My kids don’t care what I do – a job is a job after all.Katie Wolfe, , lives in Pennsylvania, USA, and is married to Sean. They have two sons Luke, , and Lincoln, six. At ft in and a UK size -, I’m not the most obvious person to be a Kate lookalike, but ever since I began posting pictures of myself dressed as her on Instagram in  I’ve picked up nearly , followers – and counting.I work with brands who give me clothes, and I’m on my way to earning an income as an influencer. After Kate got engaged I instantly fell in love with her blue Issa engagement dress and her style.  My husband Sean, , often says I look like her and, for me, that’s the greatest compliment because Kate’s the most beautul woman in the world. As social media grew I started following Kate-related Instagram pages and saw there weren’t any fuller-figured lookalikes. I was scared to put myself out there, but Sean encouraged me – “Do it!” he said. “Maybe you’ll inspire somebody .” I stick to natural make-up – a nice base, shaped eyebrows and maybe some eyeliner – and blow-dry my hair with a loose curl.I get friends or Sean to take pictures of me in my garden, mainly. My sons think being an influencer is very cool. As a stay-at-home mum I have a tight budget, so I hunt for eBay bargains, finding things Kate’s worn.It can take hours and it took a whole decade to find a cashmere-blend Ralph Lauren turtleneck sweater dress she wore in , which I managed to get for  . The most expensive item I own is Kate’s Barbour Winter Defence Jacket, a gt from Sean so I don’t know the cost – he’s so supportive. On my bucket list is to get hold of the blue LK Bennett Addison dress Kate wore when the Obamas visited Kensington Palace. It’s absolutely gorgeous! There’s a lovely Instagram community with other “Kates” – we all adore her and share tips. People post, “Where did you get that ” andsomeone can’t afford to buy Kate’s exact version, we all rally around to help find something similar that costs less. I prefer recreating her casual looks, which I can wear a lot. Now other plus-size ladies tell me I’ve inspired them, and that’s sweet because we’re not usually represented.I’ve never thought about losing weight to look like her,anything this has proved I can be me and do this. Thankfully I’ve not had to deal with trolls or any kind of negativity. At  now, Kate inspires me in more ways than just fashion. She’s so graceful and collected, and as an anxiety sufferer I try to channel that. Wearing even just her earrings makes me feel more confident and composed. She’s a great mum, too. I saw a video of Charlotte having a tantrum and thought, “OK, I can cope too” because Kate did it in front of all these important people. It’s been such a positive experience.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Even having to quickly secure a sickbag from her bodyguard for a pale child spied amid crowds during a  engagement in Coventry didn’t faze her.This all echoes another much-loved Royal from a dferent generation. Kate is following in the footsteps of Princess Diana who made this gesture her own: crouching with a relaxed empathy to listen to young confidences. For Kate, that clear connection with the little ones she meets on her engagements, was to prove the seed and catalyst for what has now become the cornerstone of her royal legacy. As she approaches her th birthday this weekend, with greater standing and responsibility within the royal ranks than ever before, the Duchess – dubbed by fans the Children’s Princess – has now confidently created her niche. Alongside the arrival of her personal role as mum to her and William’s three children, George, eight, Charlotte, six, and Louis, three, Kate has in tandem become an advocate for all children, particularly within the fields of youth mental health and early years development. Perhaps seeing the privilege of her own tots within palace walls, she has decided every UK child needs the same support and opportunities. “Kate connects really beautully with the young. I think that’s very like Diana, but that doesn’t mean that Diana has the exclusivity on that – I think it’s just something that she has within her,” says royal commentator, Ingrid Seward. The advent of motherhood in  with the arrival of Prince George has perhaps cemented natural tendencies and skills. Kate has launched her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, stating she wants to “raise awareness of why the first five years of le are just so important for our future le outcomes”. And she has been a driving force behind a landmark study on perceptions of early childhood. With patronages of children’s charities including Action for Children, Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, East Anglia Children’s Hospices, the Evelina London Children’s Hospital and PlaceBe, she also helped launch the first-ever Children’s Mental Health Week in .  Her personally designed garden at the Cha Flower Show in  was focussed on getting children out into nature to help their wellbeing. And her own brood arrived right on cue to show us how that was done, enthusiastically collecting hazel sticks and swooping gleefully on a rope swing. “I am passionate about improving children’s le chances and giving them opportunities so they can look forward to the best possible futures,” Kate said. She has spoken of her own childhood, enjoying the outdoors with the sporty Middleton family and how time outside with her own young family now make some of her most treasured moments.  And, as Kate follows her passions and carves out a strong role for herself, she is first and foremost ensuring her brood never miss out on her time, as royal children have been prone to in the past. Ingrid explains: “She will actually make sure that she arranges her royal engagements so that she can take the kids to school and be home when they come home, which is pretty dficult to do. “She decided the children were her priority, whatever she was doing. However important her work was to her, the children had to be her priority.” As her three treasured children now continue to grow, so Kate will grow with them, building her own unique position on the royal stage.

Commenting on how open the couple are with those closest to them, an insider told The Sunday Times Magazine that William is frank about whataposs on his mind, including family woes.However Kate is % more reserved than him and keeps her feelings private. The insider says that the closest Kate has ever come to revealing her thoughts on the situation was by once jokingly rolling her eyes at the mention of Suits.  Initial reports were that Kate and Meghan had fallen out, however insiders later suggested the strain was actually between William and Harry. In the biography Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claimed Meghan and Kate werenapost close as they had nothing in common, rather than because of tension. They say the women didnapost spend much time together before the Sussexes got married in May  and they didnapost get any closer afterwards. They write: Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadnapost progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. But they were not at war with each other, either. There were awkward moments, such as the day the women happened to cross paths at Kensington Palace , and although both were heading out to go shopping - in the same street - Kate went in her own Range Rover. However in Meghanaposs interview with Oprah Winfrey, she accused Kate of making her cry during the now infamous bridesmaid dress fitting ahead of the Sussexesapos  wedding. Months after the wedding it was reported that the duchesses fell out because Princess Charlotteaposs dress did not fit and further fittings needed to be scheduled. The source added: Kate had only just given birth to her third child, Prince Louis, and was feeling quite ­emotional. It was reported that Kate left the fitting in tears. However, during her interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan said the reverse happened and she was actually the one who was upset. She said: A few days before the wedding, she was upset about something pertaining - yes, the issue was correct - about flower girl dresses, and it made me cry, and it really hurt my feelings. Meghan was shocked that what she believes was the reverse of what happened went public, leaving her being blamed for a situation that she wasnapost responsible for and happened to her. Everyone in the institution knew it wasnapost true. I am not sharing that piece about Kate to be in any way disparaging about her. I would hope that she would want that to be corrected, added Meghan. When Oprah tried to get more information, Meghan stated it would not be fair to go into further details as Kate had apologised. She said Kate had apologised and sent flowers, and that all had now been forgiven.

Not only is she happily married to Prince William and the mother of three beautul children, but she has a vital role to play in the modern monarchy.Our elegant future Queen, who prefers to be known as Catherine, has come a long way from the shy university student who first caught William’s eye. Indeed, the Duchess – who recently played piano in front of millions at her Christmas carol concert – appears to grow in confidence each day. Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams says: “Kate has the world at her feet as she turns . There have been many ups, and she hasn’t had any downs. She and William pack a punch.” Here, Richard and our  of experts – psychologist Lee Chambers, stylist Martine Alexander and body language expert Andy Coley – explain how Kate has become a true st century princess. Relationships In , Kate met William at St Andrew’s University in Scotland. She was .At the time, some cruelly refered to the fact middle-class Kate was a “commoner” and before the couple’s engagement was announced in , she was nicknamed ‘Waity Katie’. But behind the scenes, William had been taking time to make sure Kate was truly ready for royal le. Richard says: “It was very sensible in the circumstances for Kate and William to get to know each other over theof time that they felt appropriate. But it can be hurtful seeing those headlines and obviously very stressful.  “William handled this by giving them as much privacy as possible, especially in the early years.” And just as William has been there for Kate, she has been there for him, too. “They are a mutual support for one another,” Richard says. “William and Kate are the perfect team.” Fashion  Another sign of Kate’s growing confidence is how her sense of style has evolved over the years. And whatever she wears – whether it’s a vest top and jeans or a dazzling gown – Kate’s choice of clothing can sell out in seconds. Celebrity stylist Martine says: “She is % a style icon. She ticks the style etiquette box that comes with the job, but is confident enough to express who she is. “I love the more casual, preppy, classic side of Kate. And I absolutely love how she mixes high street brands with designer items. It makes her much more approachable. “And the gold gown she wore to the Bond premiere was % iconic. It is just insane – it is Kate being Kate. She is making a statement, but doing it in a classic way.” Motherhood  Becoming a mother in  had a profound effect on Kate, and she often speaks about the guilt she feels as a working mum. But psychologist Lee says that parenting George, eight, Charlotte, six, and three-year-old Louis will have given Kate a vital new set of skills. ”What has become most obvious in recent years is how she has found a harmony of being a royal figurehead without losing her authenticity,” he says.  “It is finding this groove that has given her a certain gravitas and influence – and motherhood has certainly amplied her evolution. “Having three children and signicant royal duties can be challenging, but motherhood itself is useful when bringing together a wider family, and certainly hones your communication skills, patience and presence.” Family  Kate has often recalled her happy childhood with parents Carole and Michael and siblings Pippa and James. And Richard believes her family provided the perfect grounding and support network to navigate becoming part of the monarchy. “I do think a lot of the credit should go to the Middletons,” he says. “The fact that she had a happy childhood, the grounding she had, the education she had…” But Kate has also had to deal with the fallout of Harry and Meghan deciding to quit royal le and their bombshell Oprah interview.  Richard says: “Very little has been said overall about the relationship between Kate and Meghan. But the fact is that Catherine and Meghan are very dferent characters. I don’t think they would ever necessarily have been close. “The problems with the Sussexes put pressure on the Cambridges. It can’t have been easy.” Body language  When she first started dating William, Kate often looked uncomfortable in the spotlight. Body language expert Andy says: “In the early days, Kate seemed defensive and awkward in public. “She would hold her bag across her body in a protective gesture or have her hands to her face or neck, which can be a sign of a lack of confidence.” But in recent months and years, the Duchess appears to have relaxed and now appears to relish being in the public eye.  Andy says: “At the Bond premiere she looks like she is loving the event. “There is a sparkle about her that doesn’t look forced – one of those, ‘Not sure how I made it here, but I bloody love it’ moments that people in the limelight have when they embrace the attention. “The carol concert is the most relaxed I’ve seen her. I remember thinking to myself how at ease she looked playing the piano not looking about, just concentrating fully on being present in her music. Her face and smile came out once the tune had been played and there was a genuine warmth to the look.” Charity work  On April , , William and Kate married at Westminster Abbey. From that day, she became a full-time working royal but Kate didn’t rush in to anything. With William’s support, she planned how she would use her royal role as a force for good and hand-picked patronages to reflect her own passions, such as children, mental health, sport and art. Richard says: “When they do engagements and there is the possibility of doing something informal, such as playing a game, they do it. It shows the rapport between them. “At one time, I think the Duke of Edinburgh had  patronages. William and Catherine have far fewer but the idea has been to do more with fewer. It is a dferent approach.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince WilliamRoyal FamilySunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But just days later the British socialite was convicted of recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by the late American financier Jeffrey Epstein.The Duke of Yorkaposs legal team reportedly told him they believed Maxwell would be cleared, and Andrew was said by sources to be in good spirits as he ate Christmas lunch with The Queen at Windsor Castle, The Sunday Mirror has revealed.However, the prince did not join the royal family for the main Christmas day church service at Sandringham, after deciding to “keep a low profile” over the festive period as he did not want to be a distraction, according to sources. Maxwell, , was found guilty on December  on five of the six counts she faced after five full days of deliberation by a -person jury in New York.  It means the socialite could spend the rest of her le behind bars. Among the guilty verdicts was the most serious charge of sex trafficking a minor. She was also convicted of:transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex actsShe was cleared of the other charge of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. Her lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim, told reporters shortly after the verdict that we firmly believe in Ghislaineaposs innocence. Maxwellaposs legal team has since called for a retrial after two jurors subsequently said they were a victim of sexual abuse. Prince Andrew recently missed a family skiing trip to Geneva with his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, after his team advised him it would be “inappropriate” for him to be seen on holiday while facing sex allegations.Hours after the royal party ed home, Andrew suffered a further blow with the publication of a testimony from one of Maxwell’s victims.

With the world’s eyes on a possible civil court case over sex abuse claims in the US, the Duke of York stayed at home. He was literally a virtual recluse – using Skype for video calls to his people in Verbier, Switzerland. We can reveal he had daily chats with daughters Beatrice and Eugenie and the rest of the party. A source told the Sunday Mirror: “Beatrice and Eugenie were both very upset because they were hoping their children would be able to spend their first ski holiday with their grandad and the entire family. “Sadly it wasn’t to be, but they did hold Skype calls with their father nearly every day while they were in Verbier so that they could support him and he could see the grandchildren on holiday.” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  It is claimed Andrew, , had been due to fly out with the group. It included ex-we Sarah Ferguson, sons-inlaw Edo Mapelli Mozzi, , and Jack Brooksbank, , plus grandson August,  months, and three-month-old granddaughter Sienna. But the Duke got cold feet after his team advised him it would be “inappropriate” for him to be seen on holiday while facing sex allegations. And Andrew’s former pal Ghislaine Maxwell, , has just been convicted in New York of sex trafficking for Jeffrey Epstein – further complicating any ski jaunt for Andrew.  The Duke is anxiously awaiting a US ruling from Judge Lewis Kaplan on whether he will face a full civil court case over allegations he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre on three occasions in , when she was aged . He vehemently denies the claims. Beatrice, , and Eugenie, , put aside the strain to enjoy the two-week ski break, before flying back from Geneva to Heathrow on Friday. Our source said: “Beatrice and Eugenie fully support their father and are a very close family unit, which includes Sarah. “It’s more about them being there for him and supporting him as opposed to questioning him about the case. That’s not what the family is focused on – it’s about survival, protecting the family name and getting through it in one piece. The girls feel their father’s name is continually dragged through the mud unnecessarily, when really he is a good egg.  “They feel the whole thing is an unfortunate business and they don’t believe their father deserves what is happening to him.” The royal party stayed at Andrew and ex-we Fergie’s £million Swiss chalet. But it could be the family’s final visit as it understood the ski-loving prince is trying to sell the lodge as he faces spiralling legal bills. He and Fergie, , bought it from millionaire French socialite Isabelle de Rouvre for £.million in . But it has been reported they still owe £.million and that legal threats were issued last year after claims of a missed a payment in December . It is believed Andrew and Fergie agreed to sell the seven-bedroom property to a wealthy European investor last September, but the deal has still not been completed.  Andrew and Fergie orced in  but they remain close and have been living under the same roof at Royal Lodge, Windsor, since . The Duke had Christmas lunch with the Queen at Windsor Castle, when sources say he was in “good spirits” after his legal team reportedly told him they believed Maxwell was likely to be cleared. But just four days later she was convicted. Then – hours after the ski party ed home – the Duke suffered a new blow with publication of a testimony from one of Maxwell’s victims. Waiving her right to anonymity, Carolyn Andriano, , claimed Andrew’s accuser Ms Giuffre had texted her in March  to say she was going for dinner in London with Andrew, Maxwell and Epstein. She also alleged Ms Giuffre, now , later showed her the infamous picture of herself with Andrew inside Maxwell’s London mews house.  Carolyn, who was abused by Epstein and Maxwell from the age of , added: “I asked hershe’d been to the Palace. And she said, ‘I got to sleep with him’. “I said, ‘What  You’re f****** with me’, and she said, ‘No, I got to sleep with him’. She didn’t seem upset. She thought it was pretty cool.” The claims came six days after the Sunday Mirror’s exclusive interview with Anthony Figeruoa,  – Ms Giuffre’s boyfriend in . He said Virginia told him she “didn’t want to do it” – referring to sex with Andrew. Anthony says she was “scared” by what Epstein and Maxwell wanted her to do. Andrew has always denied the allegations. ButMs Giuffre’s court case gets the go-ahead and she wins, legal experts predict she could get a £million settlement. She is said to want her day in court to send a message that anyone “with power and privilege” accused of abusing young girls will face justice. The Prince still faces the prospect of being questioned by US authorities investigating links to Epstein. Florida-based lawyer Spencer Kuvin, who represents a number of Epstein victims, told the Mirror: “He now has two close friends convicted, so it should make him very concerned about his future. “I believe the best way forward for him now is to settle. I would tell him he needs to get this case sorted out and fast.” On Friday it emerged the Queen will not pay Andrew’s legal bills, now £million, or any potential settlement. But he has assured her he is innocent and she still backs him.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs eldest son is third in line to the throne and will one day become our King. Despite his extraordinary future, his proud parents are determined to give him as aposnormalapos an upbringing as possible, allowing him to enjoy his childhood with siblings Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. But royal exert Duncan Larcombe claims that George has started to understand his role and what his adult le has in store - and mum Kate has a solid plan of how to help him cope and prepare him.He told OK! magazine : “George is only just beginning to understand his destiny, but Kate has got the journey planned.” While Kate doesnapost want to put any pressure on George, sheaposs keen for him to learn the dference between public and private time early - and used the Euros to teach him a vital lesson.Kate and Wills took George to cheer on the Three Lions at Wembley, when England took on Italy in last yearaposs competition. Duncan said: “That really struck me after seeing George in his first grown-up suit with his parents at the Euros final in July. “People were asking why they hadn’t let him wear an England shirt ‘like a normal eight-year-old’. “William was apparently keen on the idea, but it was Kate, the former commoner, who said no. She was showing George that being ’on duty’ requires a dferent approach… he has to learn to don the royal armour.  “That doesn’t mean hiding his personality or feelings though – so George was encouraged to leap up and celebrate England scoring, to roar and wave and hug his mum and dad like any normal lad. And even to shed a tear when it all ended in heartbreak.Experts have previously claimed the couple would try and keep Georgeaposs future from him for as long as possible.As children, Wills and his brother Harry were well aware of their futures and the younger Wales brother used it in arguments. According to former protection officer Ken Wharfe Harry once told his brother: Youaposll be king one day, I wonapost. Therefore I can do what I want! Speaking about his son, William has previously said: Thereaposll be a time and a place to bring George up and understand how he fits in, in the world. We are very normal. Catherine Mayer, author of Charles: The Heart of a King, told E! News: With George they are trying to delay that moment of realisation and give him normality before they thrust this on him. But it will be, nevertheless, part of his upbringing both in terms of what he sees his parents and grandparents doing and probably quite soon a beginning of an understanding that he is in public le and what that means.

Jean, , is now one of the longest-serving publicans in the UK. And she has no plans to call time and retire. For the past  years, she has been running The Grfin Inn in Gresford, near Wrexham, North Wales. But she started learning her trade when she was just . Jean, who has lived in pubs since the age of eight used to help her late father, Pryce Grfiths, when he was the licensee of the White Lion pub in nearby Hope. And when the members of the local constabulary popped in, the young schoolgirl she would have to make herself scarce. “That was when I started helping behind the bar, though I really shouldn’t have done at that age,” she said.  In m she got her name above the door at The Grfin and the village pub has barely changed in all that time. She has never served food and has shunned modern attractions such as a jukebox, a pool table and satellite TV. “I don’t have any gimmicks” she laughed. There is a pub piano and Jean, who used to play the organ at the village church, can still knock out a tune when asked. She said: “I need to get the piano tuned to be honest, although I’ve been saying that for the last  years!”  One thing that has changed over the decades is the price of beer. “When I started here it was only  pence a pint,” she said. The mum-of-one added: “It is very hard work. People don’t realise how hard it is. “It’s a tough le but I have enjoyed it and I like what I do. It is a way of le for me.  “The customers are fabulous. They keep me going, they are a great crowd. “I suppose I will have to retire some time but not just yet.” Pub regular Andrew Price said: “Jean is a real character and it’s great to come into a pub where you can sit down, have a chat with friends over a pint without loud music, though from time to time Jean is asked to accompany a singalong on the piano.

Rebecca Wilkinson, , started putting on weight in her teens and saw her weight rocket after falling pregnant with her child at  - piling on nearly  stone in just under two years. She would often indulge in two takeaways a day followed by snacks like chocolate, crisps, and sweets - washed down with litres of Lucozade.At her biggest, Rebecca was defined as obese - weighing st lbs and was struggling to squeeze into a size -.After years of dieting the mum-of-one saw no changes until a trip to a psychic scared her into action. He revealed she had no futureshe carried on her unhealthy habits and told her to do whatever it takes or die. The bombshell kicked-started her weight loss journey and she booked a flight to Antalya, Turkey, to undergo a private gastric sleeve operation in September . A year after the operation to remove part of her stomach, she lost a staggering st lb - slimming down to st lb and a svelte size -. Rebecca, an apprentice plasterer, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, said: “I was desperate after years of trying and failing to lose weight. “During a visit to my psychic, he scared me into action. He said he saw aposno leapos for me on the cards. “He also said: aposDo what it takes - go to the extreme or you will die.apos I knew I had to take drastic actions and surgery was the only way. “The weight has fallen off after having my stomach removed - it’s turned my le around.” Rebecca struggled with bullies during her teens and beyond - turning to food for comfort. She saw the weight start piling on, especially after she fell pregnant with her first child, Libby, . The mum would often tuck into a takeaway for lunch and dinner - followed by snacks. She said: “I went to an all-girls school, and I was bullied really badly. In school, they nicknamed me aposRebecca double-deckerapos because I was bigger than the others girls. I definitely ate to feel better. “I’d start the day with four pieces of buttered toast, andI was peckish at midmorning, I’d easily repeat this. “For lunch, I’d get a takeaway and dinner every single night was a takeaway as well.” As her weight spiralled out of control, Rebecca struggled with her mental health and suffered from anxiety and depression. She hoped for another baby with her partner of  years, Matt, , who owns a plastering company, but struggled to conceive for the next  years due to her weight. At her biggest, she weighed a whopping st lbs and struggled to fit into a size . She said: “For years I tried to ignore the mess I was in. I wouldn’t leave the house without my mum or fiancé by my side. “I was selective over where I went in case I didn’t fit in the seat or the toilet cubicle. I even had people shouting profanities at me from passing cars. Rebecca tried and failed to diet over the years and was left feeling ‘defeated’. She was ready to give up when a trip to visit a psychic in  changed everything. According to Rebecca, he couldn’t see a future for her in the cards and told her to ‘sort it now’ or she would die. “I was sceptical of the psychic at first, but he knew things no one  did,” she said. The way he knew about how I’d eat and ‘hibernate’ afterwards. “I left the reading in tears, but it was important I did. He said: aposI don’t see any le left for you.apos It was the wake-up call I needed to change.” After the reading, Rebecca looked into private surgery for a gastric sleeve in the UK, but it would cost upwards of £,. She found the operation abroad in Turkey costing a fraction of the price - £, - and flew over in September  with her mum, Jayne Nunn, , who also underwent the surgery. The operation involved removing three-quarters of the stomach and the remaining amount formed a apossleeveapos or tube that lead to the intestine. After the surgery, Rebecca flew back to the UK and had to survive on a diet of liquids, purees, and soft foods for a month before being able to eat solid food again. Rebecca continues: My mum came with me and was such a big support. It all went well but it was a lot to adjust to with my new diet. Now I can only eat small amounts every two hours - like a Babybel or a small bit of protein like a salmon fillet. For dinner, Iaposll usually have a very small portion of whatever Iaposve cooked for the family. I donapost feel hunger or miss food.

At the peak of his obsession two years ago, he was going to the gym  times in a week and his mental health was taking a huge hit. But in the midst of his struggle he realised there was a business opportunity to help people with specic diet needs or desires, and the idea for his online food shop, WellEasy, was born. Reflecting on his time at university while he spoke to BristolLive, he said: I was quite ill. I got into a spiral of calorie counting and going to the gym obsessively.I’d get up at am for cardio, do weights at lunch and then more cardio in the evening, all while eating exactly , calories a day. It took a massive toll on my mental health. “At the same time I’d go into a shop and find something with four good ingredients that cost £, yet something highly processed with  ingredients would cost  pence. “I realised there must be a better way. Having graduated from university with an integrated Masters in History with Innovation, after five years of studying, Sonny launched the project with his school friend, Joshua Barley. The pair started working out of Sonnyaposs parentaposs home garage, but so far have already secured almost £, of funding to boost their start-up. They are supported by co-founder of online furniture giant Made, Julien Callede, who has been leading them since May this year after joining as a non-executive director. WellEasy members can shop by their lestyle choices and values according to categories like vegan, keto and gluten free, choosing from more than , products across the site.Hundreds of people have already joined, and every new member sponsors a free membership for a low-income family, NHS worker, teacher, student or armed forces veteran as part of the aposWellEasy Caresapos scheme, which  people have signed up to benefit from so far.The venture was a finalist in the University of Bristol’s New Enterprise Competition last year and was part of the universityaposs Foundership Scheme in , designed to equip students with entrepreneurial skills through workshops and networking opportunities. Sonny said: “We wouldn’t have started thisit wasn’t for Bristol Uni and the help their Careers Service gave us with startup workshops, internships and funding. Stuart Johnson, director of the University of Bristol’s Careers Service, said: Sonny’s success as a entrepreneur is all the more inspiring when you consider how radically dferent his lestyle was just a few years ago. WellEasy is making healthy food a viable option for people who otherwise couldn’t afford it. We are proud that Sonny began his journey at Bristol.

The Environment Agency had  alerts in place in England, for areas such as Bristol and Somerset, as well as six in Wales, including for the upper Severn in Powys. Met Office meteorologist Jonathan Vautrey said: There are no official ice warnings out at the moment that we have issued but we are sending out a message in general that there is an isolated risk that any wet surfaces along with these showers could lead to icy stretches. This is mainly due to the showers that will be feeding in from the west. By the end of Sunday night, higher areas in Scotland, the Pennines and Snowdonia are also likely to see some snow.  Mr Vautrey said any ice would be likely to have melted away by Sunday morning when the showers are expected to ease. Most of the ice risk will have abated before people are getting out and about, he said.  After the frost risk dissipates, commuters are likely to face a cloudy, drizzly start to the week as another band of rain is forecast across the UK. High pressure coming from the south on Wednesday is set to bring more settled weather in general from midweek onwards, with dry conditions expected for most of the country. Overnight frost and fog patches will accompany the incoming settled weather.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeEnvironment AgencySnowWeatherFloods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Adam Thwaites and his we Liz chose to put their three-bedroom home into a raffle for £ per ticket.The couple wanted to raise money for Grace House to allow the organisation to buy a wheelchair-accessible swing, which cost £,. Speaking to ChronicleLive last year, Adam said: We always planned on selling our home this year. We want to move closer to family, work, and Emily’s nursery.Over the last couple of years though, weaposve been following other property competitions, and something about it made us fall in love with the idea.  What’s more, there were loads of people who were using the opportunity to raise money for charities that meant something to them. Liz works at Grace House, a charity providing short breaks for disabled children and I was talking to the Registered Manager one day about their need for a wheelchair-accessible swing. Emily loves the swings in the park so much it made me feel sad that not everyone had the opportunity to have a go on them. We did a bit of Googling and saw these swings are around £,.  Obviously, I put two and two together and Liz and I decided that we should go for it and try to raffle off our home, enabling us to move, letting someone win an amazing prize in time for Christmas and also raising funds for Grace House. Thousands participated in the raffle and , tickets were issued as the competition came to a close. Adam and Liz fell short of their , ticket goal, but they managed to raise enough to both give away their home while still raising the first £, towards the sought after swing for Grace House.Adam told ChronicleLive : We were able to give away our home as the prize after , tickets were issued, far short of our initial goal but this has helped us to raise the first £, for the swing for Grace House. We’ve now set up a fundraising page with the help of Laura Forbesto try to raise some further funds to help buy the swing.If anyone would like to make a donation they can do so here.The competition closed on Christmas Eve and a woman was revealed as the winner of their home. Georgie Robinson, , who lives in Carlisle put her name in the hat by buying  tickets for a pound per piece.  She was overwhelmed with emotion after receiving an email to tell her she had won the competition. Georgie said: It was a shock, you just donapost imagine that youaposre going to win do you  Everyone hopes but you never think that itaposs going to happen. I bought  tickets - I put some on when the raffle first came out, then a month later I thought aposIaposll just put on a few more.apos When I found out Iaposd won, I was in that much shock...I was supposed to wrap presents after too! Working in the Navy while trying to save for a house with her partner has proved dficult for Georgie, especially with travelling expenses. And she says that winning the house outright, where she can live mortgage-free has changed her le for the better. She is now in process of relocating and transferring ownership and is excited to start her new le on the Northeast coast. Her father also lives nearby and will help her settle in. Georgie added: Winning has been a massive help, Iaposm in the Navy and I pay a lot travelling around back and forth from home, and itaposs just been really hard to save - so this is le-changing really. Adam added: We are in the process of transferring the ownership of our property to Georgie now and she is coming to visit us on Thursday evening and to look around in person. Georgie said that when we called her to tell her she had won our home, that aposthe shock came overapos and that she couldn’t think straight. She had planned on wrapping presents that night but had to go straight to bed to let the good news sink in and get over the shock of what had happened. She also asked us not to stress about finding somewhere new to live quickly as she’s not going to kick us out.

This was devastating to my dad as my parents were best friends and started dating when they were , the man explained on Redditaposs AITA forum.I played sports and my dad was my coach so I had a much closer relationship to him then my mum. I was supposed to spend one week at my mumaposs then the next week at my dads. But I would usually just lock myself in my room at my mumaposs. Usually my dad would drop me off and I would get on my bike and ride the couple miles back to his house.  He added: My mum would ask me things and I would literally pretend like she didn’t exist. It got so bad that lawyers got involved thinking my dad was turning me against my mum. My dad encouraged me to spend time with my mum, but I couldn’t. My mum tried putting us in therapy but I would just sit there till the time was up not saying a word to her. Eventually my mum broke down and let me just live with my dad. The man hasnapost spoken to his mum since he as  and would even ask his dad to get her to leaveshe turned up to watch his games. She would try to speak to him at the end of matches and he would walk right past her without even acknowledging. I cut her whole family off besides a few of my cousins that were around my age. She showed up to my high school graduation and I asked a couple teachers to remove her and they did. She never dated anyone  to my knowledge and was still attempting to reconcile with my dad a few years before he passed, calling it the aposbiggest mistake of her leapos and begging my dad to forgive her, he continued. When my dad passed a couple years ago she tried to show up to the funeral and I met her outside to ask her to leave. My fiancée Rachel was with me when I did this and my mum cried after learning we were engaged saying she couldn’t believe I hated her still this many years later. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Last week the man received a letter from his mum with a large cheque inside. In the letter she told him she couldnapost live with herself not being invited to her only sonaposs wedding and that the whole family is so upset theyaposve cut off. She also told him sheaposd been keeping tabs on him via his cousins. I ripped the cheque up and sent it back to theaddress. She shouldn’t have even known my address as I keep her blocked on all social media. I called up my cousins who admitted that since I was  they have been providing my mum with updates on me prom pics, college updates, engagement photos and they sent her my address, he continued. I was so mad that I told them they wouldn’t be invited to the wedding anymore because I don’t want my mum getting access to it. Rachel is saying I’m going too far now and uninviting my cousins along with freezing out my mumaposs whole family because of her actions is an a**hole move. The man to Reddit to question whether he was taking it too far by uninviting his cousins. Acting out as a -year-old is to be expected. Deciding not to ever forgive your mum is totally your right , one Reddit user commented. The fact that you are still throwing tantrums like a -year-old, at the age of , makes you the a**hole. Another added: Why are you punishing your mum so severely  She made an awful mistake years ago, a mistake many parents do. They have a right to their own lives and moral failings. Honestly I would encourage you to explore why you feel this hatred for your mum that seems disproportionate. Punishing your cousins for showing compassion does seem like going too far.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

These loving long dogs very much enjoy a tummy tickle from the people they know and adore, as well as a Starbucks puppuccino with scrambled eggs on the side. These silly slinky dogs have provided endless laughs for social media users with their mischievous antics, from sneaking through stair gates to refusing to go any quicker than their own pace. So here are three minutes of chaos and eight stories about a dachshunds that will make your day. You’ve got a friend in me Miniature dachshund Nellie Bean is besotted with her new cuddly toy that hasan uncanny resemblance to herself. The TikToker, nelliebeandaxie, stole viewers hearts as her owner showed them how inseparable Nellie Bean and her new sausage dog stuffy have become.The pup has a real affinity for toys designed in her likeness, as the video shows her excitement when playing with both a balloon and a stuffed animal designed in the shape of Miniature Dachshunds. But her best friend is clearly the teddy, as the pup is seen running and playing with the toy in her mouth, even cuddling it while she sleeps, all while the song ‘You’ve Got A Friend In Me’ from the film Toy Story plays in the background. Pampered pups  Three sausage dogs called Peaches, Mitzi and Challah are quite possibly the most pampered pups on the internet.The trio of daxieshave their own lounge in their owners’ home , complete with a ” TV, bar cart, fish tank and sofas. TikTok user @ bam shared the miniature room with his followers, and has amassed millions of views for his handiwork and dedication to making his pets’ apartment so beautul.The room features three dog sofas, from Wayfair, paintings and prints hung in frames at dog height, as well as lamps, rugs and pet-friendly houseplants. The bar cart is actually a bathroom organiser spray painted gold, adorned with miniature alcohol bottles and whiskey glasses to complete the look. Imaginary fireplace friend  This lonely dog was desperate for a friend.The daxie puppy whothought another dog lives with himwas left gutted when his doppelganger wouldn’t play with him.Zero, known as ‘Zero the Doxie’, believes there is a dog in the fireplace that simply doesnapost want to have fun. The pup sits patiently at the switched-off fireplace gazing into the black glass where he can see ‘another’ dachshund in the reflection, waiting for them to play. Where’s my Starbucks  Sassy sausage dog Harlee knows when her puppuccino isn’t Starbucks, andwill refuse to drink from any other cup.But her owner has worked out an ingenious way to dupe her into thinking he’s lapping up the popular beverage from Starbucks. The demanding dog turns his nose up at a whipped cream treat in a regular cup, but the Liverpool pupaposs owner has saved a branded paper cup to trick him. After refusing to eat a ‘fake’ puppuccino, his owner scoops the cream into their trusty Starbucks cup, adding extra cream with ‘aerosol cream sound effects for extra convincing’, before presenting it to the pup.Harlee - who has k Instagram followers - sticks his snoot straight in the cup to enjoy his ‘real’ Starbucks puppuccino, saying it’s ‘so much better’.The sausage with  pairs of shoes  Biscuit the dachshund has  pairs of shoes - and dog crocs in every colour. The five-year-old dog, from Piatra Neamț, in Romania, also has a whole wardrobe of colour coordinated clothes with matching hats, wigs and collars.His owner, Lavi Roz has spent nearly £, on wardrobe accessories for her beloved dog, with one pair of Crocs donning Swarovski crystals. The daxie also owns  pairs of sunglasses without lenses, and poses for pictures which are shared with his , Instagram followers.No scrambled eggs  Don’t want it…  Dusty is a a daxie who knows what she wants, and it certainly isn’t kibble with carrots and peas.This sassy dog wanted scrambled eggs for breakfast, so when her owner presented her with the dry food. Dusty quicklyshoves the bowl away in a huff.“Nope, get it away from me. I don’t want that brown ****,” the voiceover says. “I’ve seen what you’re having for tea and you offer me this  How dare you, it’s an insult.” In fairness to Dusty, she just recently gave birth to six puppies, so perhaps she feels deserving of something a bit fancier as a hard-working new mother. Dusty’s owner Chloe Booth says that it’s not unusual for the a dog to refuse her standard dog food in favour of scrambled eggs, boiled chicken or fish, adding: “She thinks she’s Queen of the house.” One speed sausage dog  Buster the sausage dog is well-known online for a hilarious personality trait.The daxie has justone speed on his walkies - slow.Buster prefers to take his time, making sure he really squeezes the maximum amount of enjoyment out of his daily exercise. Perfectly happy to go at his own pace, Buster lets his more energetic siblings lead the way, trotting along at the back by himself. In a video clip, viewers are first shown two of Buster’s siblings on their walk, both going at the same pace. But then the camera pans back around  yards to show us Buster, who is trotting along at a much slower pace and showing no signs of getting any faster. Can’t stop me now A miniature dachshund was so determined to get upstairs to find her owner, she found anincredible way to defeat a stair gateand cardboard barrier designed to stop her.Fteen-month-old dachshund Nala followed her heart and managed to squeeze her way through a narrow gap in the gate. She also maneuvered her way over a large cardboard barrier that was there to make it extra dficult. In the video, Nala can be seen pushing her back legs in an attempt to get over the cardboard, and with a few kicks she gets over to the other side and takes no hesitation in rushing upstairs to her owner, Keira.

Izzy, from Boise in Idaho, was on holiday at a friendaposs house in Pittsburgh when she went to a parlour to request an illustration of a mobile phone, in homage to Mac Milleraposs  track Missed Calls. However, things didnapost quite go to plan once Izzy took a closer look at the inking and discovered that the artist had completely misunderstood her instructions.In a TikTok shared from her handle @izzy, Izzy sobbed: I just got the worst f***king tattoo. I got my cellphone from Mac Miller and told her I wanted it  by  size. She tattooed the f**king  by . How do I fix that A close up shot of the tattoo revealed that the artist had in fact written aposxapos on the screen of the mobile phone, without realising it was a size reference. Many TikTok users were quick to question how Izzy hadnapost noticed the extra writing on the stencil, but in a follow up clip, she explained it was a genuine mistake.

I know Iaposm stupid, I know it was my fault but I have  tattoos, like Iaposve been through this before. I live in Idaho and Iaposm in Pittsburgh for the week so I went to the shop that I didnapost know, she explained. My friend that Iaposm visiting here has been to that shop before and never had a bad experience so we made the appointment and it was supposed to be fine. The  by  I didnapost see it on the stencil when she first drew it up. She added: I wanted the cell phone to say missed calls for Mac Miller aposcos I visited the blue slide park while Iaposm here, referencing the playground which inspired his debut album. So I saw it on the paper before she printed it off. I thought that was for a size reference, I wanted it  by  size. When she was doing the tattoo she had me lay down flat with my arm completely bent sideways weird.

Sohail Ahmadi was just two months old when he went missing on August  as thousands of people rushed to leave Afghanistan as it fell to the Taliban. His family, who had been evacuated to the United States, had no idea where he was until a story was published by Reuters back in November about him with his pictures and he was located in Kabul. A -year-old taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him in the airport and took him home to raise as his own. After over a month of negotiations and pleas, and ultimately a brief detention by Taliban police, Safi finally handed the child back to his grandfather and other relatives still in Kabul. They said they would now reunite him with his parents and siblings in the US.  During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation over the summer, Mirza Ali Ahmadi, the boyaposs father who had worked as a security guard at the U.S. embassy, and his we Suraya, feared their son would get crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates en route to a flight to the United States. Ahmadi said in early November that in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a unormed soldier who he believed to be an American, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining  metersto the entrance to reclaim him. Just at that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and it would be another half an hour before Ahmadi, his we and their four other children were able to get inside. But by then the baby was nowhere to be found. Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son inside the airport and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later. The rest of the family was evacuated - eventually ending up at a military base in Texas. For months they had no idea where their son was.  Many other parents were in a similar situation, becoming separated from their children during the hasty evacuation effort and withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country after a -year war. With no U.S. embassy in Afghanistan and international organizations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunications like this one. The U.S. Department of Defense, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday. On the same day Ahmadi and his family were separated from their baby, Safi had slipped through the Kabul airport gates after giving a ride to his brotheraposs family who were also set to evacuate. Safi said he found Sohail alone and crying on the ground.  After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the babyaposs parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his we and children. Safi has three daughters of his own and said his motheraposs greatest wish before she died was for him to have a son. In that moment he decided: I am keeping this baby. If his family is found, I will give him to them. If not, I will raise him myself.Safi said he took him to the doctor for a check-up after he was found and quickly incorporated the child into his family. They called the baby Mohammad Abed and posted pictures of all the children together on his Facebook page.After the Reuters story about the missing child came out, some of Safiaposs neighbors - who had noticed hisfrom the airport months earlier with a baby - recognized the photos and posted comments about his whereabouts on a translated version of the article. Ahmadi asked his relatives still in Afghanistan, including his father-in-law Mohammad Qasem Razawi, , who lives in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, to seek out Safi and ask him toSohail to the family. Razawi said he traveled two days and two nights to the capital bearing gts - including a slaughtered sheep, several pounds of walnuts and clothing - for Safi and his family.  But Safi refused to release Sohail, insisting he also wanted to be evacuated from Afghanistan with his family. Safiaposs brother, who was evacuated to Calornia, said Safi and his family have no pending applications for U.S. entry. The babyaposs family sought help from the Red Cross, which has a stated mission to help reconnect people separated by international crises, but said they received little information from the organization. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said it does not comment on inidual cases. Finally, after feeling they had run out of options, Razawi contacted the local Taliban police to report a kidnapping. Safi denied the allegations to the police and said he was caring for the baby, not kidnapping him. The complaint was investigated and dismissed and the local police commander helped arrange a settlement, which included an agreement signed with thumbprints by both sides. Razawi said the babyaposs family in the end agreed to compensate Safi around , Afghanifor expenses incurred looking after him for five months. The gandfather of the baby complained to us and we found Hamid and based on the evidence we had, we recognized the baby, said Hamid Malang, the chief area controller of the local police station. With both sides in agreement, the baby will be handed over to his grandfather, he said on Saturday. In the presence of the police, and amid lots of tears, the baby was finally ed to his relatives.  Razawi said Safi and his family were devastated to lose Sohail. Hamid and his we were crying, I cried too, but assured them that you both are young, Allah will give you male child. Not one, but several. I thanked both of them for saving the child from the airport, Razawi said. The babyaposs parents told Reuters they were overjoyed as they were able to see with their own eyes the reunion over video chat. There are celebrations, dance, singing, said Razawi. It is just like a wedding indeed. Now Ahmadi and his we and other children, who in early December were able to move off the military base and resettle in an apartment in Michigan, hope Sohail will soon be brought to the United States. We need to get the baby back to his mother and father. This is my only responsibility, his grandfather said. My wish is that he shouldto them.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls own natural winter wonder","story":"Hair ice is a type of ice that forms on dead wood and takes the shape of fine, silky hair.It is believed to be caused by a fungus and occurs in hard and dead wood, although the reason behind its formation remains unclear.The conditions for hair ice to occur are fairly specic, requiring just the right temperature, moisture and wood type – and it seems that the #temperate rainforest# of Argyll provides just that.Dr Phil Anderson from the Scottish Association for Marine Sciencefirst noticed hair ice when he moved to Taynuilt from Cambridge  years ago and has begun looking into the phenomenon.He said: #Hair ice is not that common butyou want to find it, Argyll is about as good a place as anywhere in the world.#I first noticed it in my garden there was this fragile bit of ice sitting in the sunshine where it shouldn#t have been. I#ve since seen it up Glen Lonan and other places locally.#I#ve worked in Antarctica and studied how snow hardens but I found hair ice formation absolutely fascinating. It#s just weird!#Dr Dorothee Gotz works at Lallemand Aquapharm, which has a lab at SAMS, and shares an interest in hair ice formation.Lallemand Aquapharm holds a culture collection that includes fungus and, as a microbiologist, Dr Gotz recognised that the fungus responsible for hair ice formation would be worth including in the collection.She said: #I saw hair ice for the first time three years ago in Sutherland#s Grove, so I took a sample to add to our collection.#It#s a fascinating bit of microbiology. A fungus that forms ice and degrades wood is certainly of interest and could potentially have industrial applications.#Both scientists are keen to find out why this phenomenon occurs but say there is very little published literature on it, perhaps because it is so rare.#We don#t know what#s in it for the fungus,# explains Dr Gotz. #It needs to expend a lot of energy to create the hair ice and there is no apparent benefit to doing this.#Water is a problem for micro-organisms when it freezes, as ice can puncture the membrane. Perhaps the fungus is trying to expel the water before it becomes a problem.#Hair ice is most likely to form on dead wood with no bark. It also forms on certain trees more than others and prefers hard woods such as birch.#As a rough guide,the gritters are out, then hair ice might be out too,# said Dr Anderson. #You’re most likely to find it on a crisp, sunny morning after a clear night.

This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries.

This is why – centuries after tens of thousands of innocent people, most of them women, were massacred across Europe – we see anti-Trump protesters casting themselves as “the granddaughters of the witches you couldn’t burn”. It’s why, even as campaigners in Scotland push for pardons for those ly accused, there is a growing market for grimoires on Etsy and other websites.Mona Chollet identies this contradiction early on in her book, In Defence of Witches. As a young girl she was captivated by Flutter Mildweather from The Glassblower’s Children, a novel by Swedish author Maria Gripe. She was enchanted by her indigo cloak and her remarkable hat with its flower-strewn brim. Here was a witch who made the baddies “bite the dust” and “offered the promise of revenge over any adversary who under-estimated you”. Flutter became for her a talisman, “a memory of what a woman of stature could be”.Chollet says it took her half a letime to appreciate the degree of misunderstanding within this “magnet for fantasy” to understand that, before becoming a spark to the imagination, the word “witch” had been “the very worst seal of shame”.The premise of her book, first published in France in , but now translated into English by Sophie R Lewis, is that the witch-hunts of the th-th centuries were rooted in misogyny, and that women are still on trial today.On one level this is uncontroversial. We know misogyny remains re, and that the idea of the \"witch\" has also been co-opted by anti-feminists, who use it to denigrate powerful women. During the  US election, Hillary Clinton was shown with a green face, riding a broomstick, and branded “the wicked witch of the left”. Its the go-to insult for Nicola Sturgeon, too.A further problem stems from Chollets decision to structure her book around what she claims as three \"archetypes\" from the witch-hunts. There is one chapter on independent women, one on women who choose not to have children and one on women “who reject the idea that to age is a terrible thing”. Chollets contention is that, several centuries on, these same types of women are having the same charges levelled against them.But this is an over-simplication. As those at the forefront of the campaign for the Scottish \"witches\" to be pardoned have stressed, most of those executed were ordinary Christian women trying to keep their heads down. And – while some may have been picked on by neighbours with a grudge – their wider persecution was born of a societal belief in, and fear of, witchcraft.This over-simplication is most obvious in the chapter titled “The scourge of women’s independence”. Most of those executed as witches were accused of “consorting with the devil”. Chollet asks: “Who is this devil who, from the th century onwards … began to loom behind the figure of every female, every sorceress, every woman who was slightly too forward or too much of a stirrer to the point that they became a mortal threat to society  Whatthis devil were in fact independence ” Not only does she imply that those targeted were rabble-rousersbut she underplays the extent to which, at that period, the devil was a real and terrying entity.There was certainly misogyny in the notion that women were morally inferior and so more susceptible to the devil’s advances. And the witch-hunts did coincide with a wider disempowerment as women who had been \"smiths, butchers, bakers and candlestick makers\" were pushed out of those spheres. But when, for example, midwives were charged with witchcraft it tended to be because a child had died rather than an orchestrated attack on the profession.This is not to say Chollet’s book is of no interest. It starts off well, with a look at early artistic representations of witches, and goes on to link the witch-hunts with antisemitism. Chollet suggests both persecutions were a product of society’s need to find a scapegoat for its ills, pointing out that terms such as “sabbath” and “synagogue” were also used in reference to witches, while both groups were depicted with hooked noses.There is also a thought-provoking section on the commodication of modern witchcraft. As well as being a spiritual and or political practice, Chollet, says, it is a money-spinner. “Capitalism is always engaged in selling back to us in product form all that it has first destroyed,” she writes.There is an attempt to bring it all together at the end. Chollet quotes historian Guy Betchel, who once wrote: “It is likely that we are, at least partially, indebted to the unjustiable massacre of the witches for a change in mindset towards greater rationality, greater justice, stronger support for the right to legal defence and general awareness of human rights.” Chollet believes the legacy of the witch hunts is an enduring contempt for women. Her take seems the more plausible, but the case she makes is too nebulous for the book to be anything other than frustrating."},{"url":null,"title":"quay-hotel-spa-deganwy","story":"The Quay Hotel  Spa reopened in North Wales in spring , after a lockdown refurbishment and unsurprisingly its  rooms have been well-occupied and enjoyed since then.

Here in Scotland, there is a clear message, clear action, support in place and the quickest roll-out of the boosters. Contrast that with no clear message, no restrictions, and no support nationally for businesses through the reintroduction of furlough all adding to ision and confusion.The world focus was on Glasgow in  for COP and the Westminster Government did everything in its power to exclude the First Minister from being part of the event. What kind of togetherness does that create Anti-UK rhetoric is being peddled again from No  as the Scottish Government is forced to take mitigating measures to protect vulnerable citizens from the Westminster Governments withdrawal of the £ a week uplt to Universal Credit, the latest and largest welfare cut since the Second World War.The Westminster Governments \"levelling up\" scheme, supposedly rolling out throughout the UK, bypasses the Holyrood and other devolved governments. Before the Scottish Government can work constructively with Westminster there is the small matter of Westminster showing respect to the devolved nations, to date a scarce commodity.But I am sure at the root of Mr Redfern’s sentiments in his letter lies a denial of the  Holyrood election result, something which cannot be ignored.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.DIFFERENCE HAS DONE US GOODMARTIN Redfern insists that the First Minister should “stop spinning anti-UK rhetoric and try acting constructively with Westminster – including on Covid – rather than habitually pursuing ision”.I suggest that we should follow Mr Redfern’s advice when Westminster policy on Covid is sensible. It is, though, dficult to come to this conclusion when in England people are being allowed to do as they please, but at the same time Nightingale wards are being built as an emergency. Or that at the time of writing, daily cases in Scotland are lower than in England as well as hospitalisations. However, simultaneously the First Minister is berated as a killjoy. Asked by a TV interviewer what Edinburgh would miss with Hogmanay being cancelled the comedian Vladimir McTavish answered “a fourth wave of Covid”.Mr Redfern would do better to understand that the philosophies, opinions and even the aims of the elected governments in London and Edinburgh are fundamentally dferent. Division exists, Mr Redfern, and rather than trying to avoid debate by uncritically staying in “lockstep” with London , the Scottish Government has followed its own advice and I would suggest that in public health terms at least, we have profited from this.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.IT IS NOW TIME FOR A DIVORCELAST week’s Big Read by Mark Smithopined that the UK’s fault lines are widening. I wonderthe gap is already irreparable.I observe that people in the UK are now iding across two radically dferent concepts of the type of state in which they want to live. These do not necessarily follow national boundaries and certainly not political parties.The dferent states can be distinguished by no more than, say,  fundamentals: written constitution v unwritten constitution proportional representation v first past the post immigration-friendly v immigration-hostile NHS v private healthcare international v isolationist soft capitalism v hard capitalism society v inidual doveish v militaristic, and more.Like two people in a marriage who have developed irreconcilable dferences, regrettably the only solution is orce.Stuart MacDonald, Newton Mearns.LABOUR SHOULD CO-OPERATE WITH TORIESMY fervent wish for  is that the Labour Party in Scotland realises that the Tories are not their greatest enemy. They may disagree with the basic principles and economic plans and dferent emphases of the Conservative Party, that is normal and understandable almost every country has a right-left split. But the Tories are not Labour’s real enemy and those who think so are deluded.When Scottish Labour grasps the fundamental truth that Scottish nationalism is the enemy, not the Tories, and that for many years it has fallen into the nationalist trap and continues to do so while they rub their hands in glee, only then will its recovery and healing process have begun. The SNP is the one-issue-obsessed party that has dragged down the working people of this country, the people whom Labour usually claim to represent. There should be no more cowering. No more fear of being labelled \"anti-Scottish\". Then a phoenix Labour party of the centre ground can rise again.So, Labour, get off the back foot and start co-operating where it is feasible with all other willing partners in ridding Scotland of a far greater menace than any Tory government.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.LET US FOLLOW SINGAPORES EXAMPLEJOHN V Lloydraises an interesting point for consideration. If people in Singapore choose not to be vaccinated against Covid yet end up in hospital, they are handed a bill for their treatment. We should adopt the same rule in the UK. Discuss.Kath Hay, Edinburgh.* JOHN V Lloyd lauds the fact that Singapore bills Covid-unvaccinated patients for their hospital treatment. Presumably he also thinks that obese patients, smokers and heavy drinkers should also be billed.Geoff Moore, Alness.WHY ENGLAND WOULD WANT INDEPENDENCESNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford is constantly moaning to the UK Government about the charges that the National Grid makes for transporting electricity generated by wind turbines to where it is consumed. He wants this reduced. Why Those who built the turbines – all foreign companies – knew the National Grid charges before they applied for planning. They already get paid for producing electricity and paid not to produce electricity. Since  these companies have been paid more than £ billion in constraint payments which were added to all UK electricity bills. If the English ever find out they are subsidising electricity bills in Scotland it is they who will be demanding independence from Scotland.Clark Cross, Linlithgow.BISHOPS SHOULD FOLLOW TUTU ON ABORTIONSARAH Weddington , the lawyer in the  Roe vs Wade case, died on Boxing Day .

If standing in the proximity of a nuclear blast does not fit its criteria then I don’t know what would.While  was another disappointing year for the UK nuclear veterans, both the French and United States nuclear veterans were awarded medals by their governments, the French in January  and the US in December . Once again the UK and the North Koreans are the only nuclear powers that fail to recognise their nuclear veterans in any way.On November ,  at Prime Minister’s Questions Boris Johnson in answer to a question stated: “I will certainly make sure that we get a proper meeting with the representatives of the nuclear veterans.”This meeting has not yet taken place, but when it does I hope that the Prime Minister does the honourable thing and finally awards the UK nuclear veterans the medal that they truly deserve.Colin Moir, Peterhead."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13355787.jpg?type=article-full","title":"review-renpho-smart-jump-rope","story":"A smart, lightweight workout jump rope.Good points Made from robust steel wire with a smooth PVC coating, the portable Smart Jump Rope by Renpho is a straightforward and fun way to kick-start any fitness plans.Comprising three skipping modes, as well as time and numbers countdown, the internal circuitry is intelligent enough to tally skips, keep track of time and let you know when you have completed your workout.Renpho Smart Jump Rope The accompanying app can help track and analyse workout data such as skip time, total skip number, calories burned and flag up any tangles.

STYPic Gorltspan classtruncate-full-screengtdon Terris Herald  TimesThe house itself is a neat s council semi-detached with a little porch and a line of shrubs out front. Hannah grew up here with her brother and her mum and it was tough at times, she says. Her mother, who was a social worker, didn’t have a lot of money.There was also a lot of poverty in the streets around her Hannah remembers friends at her school who were really struggling. But she also recalls the freedom she enjoyed, the open spaces. Livingston was a happy place for her, she says.Livingston is also where Hannah, who’s  now, discovered her political values. In the s, her granny would shout at the telly whenever Margaret Thatcher was on.Her mother fought against the closure of the local high school, forced through by the Labour council, and Hannah remembers going to some of the protests when she was a girl and holding the placards. Some  years later, the same beliefs have led her to where she is now: the MP for the town where she grew up.And now, a lot of that political energy is being turned to a new mission: the campaign to turn Livingston from a town into a city.In all,  parts of the UK – including eight in Scotland – have applied to win the title in a competition being run by the UK Government to mark the Queen’s Platinum jubilee. Including Livingston, the Scottish places that have applied are, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Elgin, Greenock, Oban, St Andrews and most curiously, the whole of South Ayrshire. In the end, three places in the UK will be granted the status and become a city.What makes the competition a little bit tricky is that there isn’t really an absolute definition of what a city is.To most of us, the word “city” probably means a big, densely-populated urban area, but some British cities are no bigger than your average town. Some people also assume you need to have a cathedral or a university to become a city, but that isn’t the case either. In fact, what defines a city is a little unclear and that means the competition to become the next one could be anyone’s game.For Hannah Bardell, winning the competition for Livingston would be the logical next step in the story of her community. Originally part of the th century boom in shale mining, the villages and clachans of the area were selected as the site of one of the new towns of the s. The aim was to help ease the overcrowding in Glasgow and thousands moved out, including Hannah’s grandparents.“People were moving from slum conditions,” she says, “and in Livingston my grandparents had a front and back door, a garden and an inside toilet and it was a fresh start.”Bardell’s argument for turning Livingston from a new town into a city touches on a number of issues – some practical, some emotional, and some which leave her a little torn.One of the factors, she says, is the practical and commercial one. Her area has suffered a number of closures and shutdowns over the years – including, famously the Golden Wonder factory in the s .When we meet, Bardell has also just finished helping to negotiate a Scottish Government deal to save the local Covid vaccine manufacturer Valneva. Quite simply, she hopes city status will help attract and keep firms that can provide jobs.She also hopes that, as well as attracting more investment, city status could help ease the poverty which she has witnessed her whole le. Her mother worked as a social worker during the heroin explosion of the s and s and money was tight.“We struggled,” she says. “My mum had a good job but this was before the days of proper child benefit.”As a teenager, Bardell also saw the side effects of poverty. “You just hung about and drank,” she says. “I saw stuff and experienced stuff that meant I was pretty street-wise. There were kids doing stuff that they definitely shouldn’t have.”She tells me about a local shop that was packed with alcopops, but she also remembers the youth club where she got involved with local theatre. Maybe there could be more of that in a city, she says.Bardell says the deprivation in Livingston, as well as the sometimes brutal s design, has also led to something of an image problem for the town and she’s hopeful that city status could help to change that. Some of it is good-natured banter – the jokes about all the roundabouts for example.“I made a joke once,” she says, “that in London you’re never more than a few feet from a rat, and in Livingston you’re never more than a few feet from a roundabout.” But she also tells me how angry she got when someone called the town a sh*t-hole to her face. She was angry, she says, because it’s not. She’s proud of it.To prove her point, Bardell shows me some of the sights of the town and I can see how it’s changing as well as the changes that are still needed.We walk through one of the underpasses that were unpopular for a long time but have been given a makeover with street art. We pop into the skatepark and talk about the theatre and the shopping mall and we walk down Hannah’s old street where her mum lived for  years.There’s good social housing here people working in the public sector can still afford to buy or rent. But Hannah herself admits that it may lack the things that anchor other communities, like an established high street or a long history.“I think we’ve struggled with our identity partly because we are a new town,” she says. But perhaps becoming a city could help, she says. The word she uses is “place-making”.All of these factors make Livingston one of the most interesting bids for city status – it’s the only new town that’s applied – but it shares some of the same issues of the other bidders, particularly the need to attract visitors and investment.One of the most interesting bids is South Ayrshire which might have been expected to apply as Ayr but has applied as the whole region taking in Troon, Maybole and the rural areas. It’s a bid that really does question what a city is and what it could be in the future.I speak to one of the people behind the bid, Maybole councillor William Grant, and one of the main planks of his campaign is, in a way, the exact opposite of Livingston’s.He tells me about the ancient history of South Ayrshire: William Wallace held his first parliament here and it has links with Robert the Bruce and Mary Queen of Scots and Robert Burns of course. Grant believes the area can be a greater draw for tourists but that they tend to land in Edinburgh or Glasgow and head north. City status for South Ayrshire could just change that, he says.In other ways, South Ayrshire is applying for city status because it faces exactly the same problems as Livingston and, like Hannah Bardell, William Grant has felt them personally.He grew up in village of Crosshill, a few miles from Maybole, and worked as a engineer in heavy transport and electronics. But twice, the companies he worked for went to the wall and he faced redundancy and it’s a familiar problem across Ayrshire: much of the industry that provided most of the jobs has gone.The problem has meant that a lot of young people leave Ayrshire and never come back and William Grant thinks city status could help reverse that.“What happens is that people go to university, they see what a city is like and they don’t come back,” he says.“So it’s important we have the housing in place for younger people. I want young people to have the ability to stay in this area so there also need to be jobs. The housing is affordable – there are expensive areas but some are not.”Grant believes city status would help draw in the kind of investment needed to tackle some of these problems.So how does he rate the chances of winning  The decision is officially in the gt of the Queen but will be made by a  established by the UK government which includes staff from the Scottish Office as well as independent voices from the heritage and museums sector and I ask Granthe thinks applying as a region rather than an urban area will reduce the chances of winning.“No, I don’t think so,” he says. “There might be someone there who says ‘oh wait a minute, why has South Ayrshire put it in for it ’ and they might take a closer interest because of that and say why are they doing it  Andthey look at what we’ve said there are a lot of positives in it.”For Hannah Bardell as an SNP politician, the fact that the city status is in the gt of the Queen and the UK government and that applicants are asked to include details of their town’s royal connections, did give her pause for thought.“It did a wee bit,” she says. “There’s part of me that feels uncomfortable about that and I don’t think a lot of people in the community would necessarily feel connected to that.”However, her vision of Livingston as a city includes a possible future as a city in an independent Scotland. “That’s the vision for me of independence,” she says. “People will want to come back here to be part of building something sowe get city status people will want to come back here or start a le here.”She does however recognise that some people in Livingston like and value its status as a town.“I understood the point about remaining a town and being proud of that status,” she says, “but then I thought about it and I thought we’ve got an opportunity here not just to follow the traditional model of what a city is but create a new one and break new ground because that’s what Livingston did as a new town – we broke new ground literally.”She recognises too that we’re dealing partly with semantics here – there is no legal or agreed definition of the word city – but she does think it can have practical as well as psychological consequences.“I think what I felt was we have an opportunity to set a new standard of what a city is and I think we are in Scotland about looking to the future, whatever that is, and obviously my politics are my politics.\"I believe in an independent Scotland but also believe in a Scotland being the best it can be and having a good mix of cities towns and villages is really important. We’ve got to a critical mass in Livingston where we’re ready for that.”She also believes the word “city” could change Livingston’s image as well as the self-image of some of the people who live there.“I hope it will instill in those who perhaps have a tendency to do down an area to think about it in dferent terms and the things we have to be proud of. There’s no doubt we have challenges and issues, and we will continue to have challenges and issues , but how do you take them on  Well, you think about how you can be better and how you can build the area up.”One of the challenges in achieving that, says Bardell, is the tendency of Scots to be suspicious of promoting ourselves.“It’s a Scottish thing. We don’t like to blow our own trumpet, we’re self-effacing, we do ourselves down – in a humorous way. But we need to get more to grips with who we are and even on a small scale there’s an opportunity to do it. For me, Livingston should and can be the beacon of what a new city and a new Scotland can be about.”Scotland’s newest city: who’s in with a chance DumfriesThe town has campaigned to get city status for more than  years and lost out in  so may be one of the frontrunners this time. It has also pitched its bid as Scotland’s most southerly city and was made a royal burgh in the th century. The application process asks for well-known people who have connections to the area and famous Dumfries residents include JM Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, and Robert Burns.DunfermlineOne of two Fe towns bidding to become a city – the other is St Andrews – it has strong royal connections Robert the Bruce is buried in the Abbey. Seen as one of Europe’s fastest growing towns, with a population of over , and rising, some consider it a city already. It is in with a serious chance.South AyrshireThe most unusual application – although Ayr has applied before – South Ayrshire Council has applied as an entire region and, at ,, it certainly has the population of a city. Its application emphasises its history, expanding aeronautics industry and tourist-friendly beaches and villages, but it is probably one of the outliers in the competition.ElginFor many of its residents, Elgin is a city already due to the presence of its cathedral and its status as royal burgh but officially it is still a town. Often feeling overshadowed by Aberdeen to the east and Inverness to the west, official city status from the Queen would be a rubber-stamp of how it already feels.GreenockLike Livingston, Greenock sees its bid as a way to help it regenerate and recover from the post-industrial slump of the s and s. Stephen McCabe, leader of Inverclyde Council, said: “We have so much to offer and we want to encourage more people to discover Greenock and Inverclyde as a place to live, work and do business so bidding for city status can only help raise our profile further and potentially open doors.”ObanThe Highland town’s application has emphasised its importance as a transport hub – it has one of the busiest ferry ports in the UK. The town’s leaders also see it as a way of boosting tourism even further – in the summer months, its population grows from , to over ,.St AndrewsThe town’s high profile and history makes it one of the frontrunners. Not only does the application emphasise its status as the home of golf, it is also home of the country’s first university. The civic leaders have argued that civic status would benefit the rest of Fe by attracting visitors beyond golfers or day-trippers from Edinburgh.LivingstonThe youngster of the bunch – starting as a cluster of villages, the new town was developed in the s as a solution to the overcrowding in Glasgow and has since expanded rapidly. Having struggled with deprivation and the loss of local employers, the leaders of the bid see city status as a means of promoting the community and attracting investment."},{"url":null,"title":"weird-wonderful-plants-identified-lockdown","story":"But it’s now emerged that four new Scottish species of fungi have been identied by scientists at Scotland’s leading botanical garden since the start of lockdown.The miniscule fungi, found by scientists at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh , are in addition to three new species of toadstools which were identied in  by experts at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.One of identied toadstools was found in Caithness, and the other two in the Black Wood of Rannoch. They are part of a prolic group of fungi known as web caps, because they are covered by a cap of threads resembling spiders webs.The toadstools live in harmony with trees, helping the likes of oak, beech, birch and pine absorb water and nutrients.The four new species identied by the RGBE scientists since the start of lockdown include two types of Opegraphaceae, a type of lichenized fungi, and two species of Tremellaceae – parasitic fungi that live on lichen. One was found in Glen Feshie and the other in Glen Fenzie.The new Scottish species are among more than  new types of plant identied by the RBGE staff since lockdown began, including dozens of threatened species, most of them native to tropical climates.They include  flowering plants including eight new gingers, salvias, impatiens, liverworts and nine single-celled diatoms.Two new Scottish diatoms were identied by the scientists in .In some cases, the plants have been growing within specialist facilities in Scotland before being formally named, and are often the result of research by RBGE and its international partners around the world including Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos, South America and the rainforests of Central Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo.The RBGE scientists typically identy more than  new species every year – roughly one plant every week. However, it is unusual for new Scottish species to be identied.New plants and fungi are discovered around the world at the rate of about , a year.Last week RBG Kew named approximately  plants and fungi from Africa, Asia, the Americas and the UK which have been identied in the past year.They include a killer insect-trapping tobacco plant, Nicotiana insecticida, collected in Western Australia by a truck stop on the Northwest Coastal Highway in Western Australia. It was cultivated back in London in the glasshouses at Kew Gardens, where the plants continued to kill insects providing that its insidious deadly nature is not diminished by the great distance from its homeland.The list also includes a new species of fungi hidden within a wild banana seed,  new orchids including a ‘ghost’ orchid that grows in almost complete darkness, and five new species of Cape primroses from the Democratic Republic of Congo among them one which is particularly vulnerable to extinction due to its proximity to copper mines.Scientists at Kew point out that some could be important for people and planet – providing vital income to communities, having the potential to be developed into a future food or medicine, or simply keeping the habitat around them thriving.The first new species of  has already been identied, having first been collected by a Scottish scientist, Lorna MacKinnon,  years ago during an expedition in the Cameroon rainforest.The tree, Uiopsis dicaprio, has been named in honour of Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio in recognition of his conservation work and efforts to raise awareness of the impact of logging on rare Ebo species.Already branded as ‘critically endangered’, it features glossy, yellow-green flowers and grows to four metres tall. It will be considered a member of the ylang ylang family.The tree only grows in the Cameroon forest and was spotted by Lorna, from Glasgow, who took samples back to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where it has now been formally named.Lorna said: “It was my first job after I graduated. The area is incredibly species rich and relatively under-collected particularly at that time. I was collecting anything that looked of interest.“The collections were made and went to the herbarium waiting to be looked at by specialists.“During lockdown, senior researcher Dr Martin Cheek and other members of the team were going through specimens and looking at photographs and recognised it as a new species.”Dr Martin Cheek, Senior Researcher in RBG Kew’s Africa team says: “It’s easy to assume that we know all of the plant and fungi species on our planet.“ There are wonderful apps that enable identication of plant species in the UK and other countries where species ersity is low and well-studied.“But in most parts of the tropics, identication of plants is still a big challenge, and thousands of species still remain without scientic names. This is a problem because until a species has a scientic name, assessment of its extinction risk is near impossible, and that makes protection from extinction and research into its properties, incredibly dficult.“Sadly, several species in ’s list are already considered as under threat of extinction from increasing threats to their natural habitat, and three are already believed to be extinct in the wild. This list is another reminder that this is our last chance to find unknown species, name them and hopefully protect them before they become globally extinct.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tony-blair-knighthood-iraq-veteran-sickened-honour-former-pm","story":"He spent six years as a Naval Chaplain with time served in Iraq and Afghanistan from  to  and while he was there to support troops, inevitably he was also there to support bereaved relatives during dark times.Speaking from a personal point of view, the director of Glasgow-based Community Veterans Support said the news that former prime minister Tony Blair was awarded a Knighthood as the New Year Honours were released did not sit well with him.Read more: New Year Honours : Knighthood for Tony Blair as scientists honoured for fight against covid“I just felt sick when I heard about it,” said Mr Devenney. “I spent too many hours waiting on the tarmac at RAF Brize Norton waiting for the Hercules aircraft to bring bodies back and seeing the pain of the families.“I was always against the Iraq War. I didn’t think the reasons we were there were justied. I know it goes with the territory with former prime ministers being given honours, but I don’t agree with it. ”Mr Devenney’s comments come as more than one million people have signed a petition to have Blair’s knighthood “rescinded”. Sir Tony is appointed a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior British Order of Chivalry, by the Queen.Mr Devenney is helping veterans since leaving the forces for a second time.He joined the Royal Marines in  and during his -year military career, in which he rose to the rank of Colour Sergeant, he saw active service in the Falklands conflict. After leaving he went to university to study theology and, in , took up a post as a naval chaplain where his role was to support servicemen and ultimately their families in times of tragedy.He is now director of the Community Veterans Support based in Govan’s Pearce Institute where he is involved in leading a drop-in centre.It was forced to close its doors during lockdown restrictions but adapted to be able to keep users feel connected. From food parcel drops to even pitching a gazebo in a veteran’s gardens and pulling up a deckchair to offer some support and a listening ear, Mr Devenney and his team quickly changed the way they worked.Read more: New Year Honours : Full Scottish list revealedMr Devenney added: “We have around  veterans on our list, including four in their s who served in the Second World War. We are a drop-in centre so the essence of what we do is being there for when people need us. We had to close our doors during lockdown but it was important we still reached our socially-isolated veterans who might have dficulty getting about even without the added issue of Covid.”He is hoping thatrestrictions ease then the service can welcome people back later this month and restart the daily lunch club.“We provide a meal for about  people every day and it is not just about feeding people – it is about the interaction and camaraderie which is important and was part of their time in the forces.”As the news begun to sink in that Sir Tony had been awarded the highest accolade, it was a dficult announcement for many to take.Rose Gentle, the mother of a Glasgow soldier who was killed at the age of  while fighting in Iraq has called on Sir Tony to refuse his Knighthood.Mrs Gentle said she was in shock when she learned the news and after it began to sink in she felt disgusted and was left asking the question what did her son Gordon’s le mean Gordon, from Pollok, died after a bomb planted by the side of a road in Basra, Iraq was detonated as his Land Rover passed.Private Gentle, who served with the Royal Highland Fusiliers, was straight out of basic training when he died in June, . He had been sent to Iraq with only  weeks training.The Change.org petition, which aims to strip the former prime minister of his appointment, reached one million signatures.A statement accompanying the petition said: “Tony Blair caused irreparable damage to both the constitution of the United Kingdom and to the very fabric of the nation’s society.“He was personally responsible for causing the death of countless innocent civilian lives and servicemen in ious conflicts. For this alone he should be held accountable for war crimes. Tony Blair is the least deserving person of any public honour, particularly anything awarded by Her Majesty the Queen.”*To find out more about Community Veterans Support go to https:www.facebook cominghomeglasgow"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-bonus-point-victory-ospreys-perfect-preparation-exeter-clash-says-kyle-steyn","story":"Warriors blew away the cobwebs after two weekends of Covid enforced idleness with a performance which combined accuracy and intent in attack with stubbornness in defence. The set-piece stacked up after a shaky start, and there was maturity and intelligence in how the key decision-makers managed the match. In the end, the - score-line flattered the visitors. Some sloppiness in the first half – perhaps aof the team’s lack of recent action – handed Ospreys stand-off Gareth Anscombe the chance to keep his team in touch with four successful penalties, while the only try conceded by Warriors came from a defensive lapse in the th minute, when the game was already dead as a contest. All in all, it was a good day at the office for Danny Wilson’s side, but they know that they will face a step-up in class next weekend.  Since suffering a humbling - defeat at Scotstoun in mid-December – in Warriors last game before their Covid outbreak – the Chiefs have beaten Bristol Bears - at home and suffered a gut-wrenching - away loss to Harlequins on Saturday . After a slow start to the season, Chiefs are beginning to look a bit more like the irresistible force they have been in recent seasons. “It’s obviously been a disrupted period for us these last couple of weeks, but there was a lot of emphasis on trying to build on what we did against Exeter in our last game before the lay-off,” said Steyn on Saturday evening. “The fact there wasn’t any fans there, as well, made it a bit dferent. But I think we did well to adapt, and it was a good win for us in the end.   ‘We got some decent time with ball in hand, and also had to make some important defensive sets, so it was a good workout for us before Exeter.” A win on Saturday would be a big statement for Glasgow and all but guarantee qualication to knock-out stages of the Champions Cup. A loss would not be a disaster, but it would prick the bubble of belief which has developed within the squad. “We know that we can do it, but that game is in the past now,” Steyn replied when asked whether the previous match will shape his team’s approach to this re-match. “They’re at home and they will be hungry to put things right. For us, it’s just about taking the belief out of the previous game.  Sione Tuipulotu edged out homegrown flanker Rory Darge for the man-of-the-match award against Ospreys – thanks to an energetic all-round performance both sides of the ball, topped off with two tries which showcased the lethal combination of pace and power the Australian-born Scottish-capped centre possesses – and he is one of a handful of southern hemisphere imports who have added real bite to the Warriors squad this season. “Sione had a tough time when he arrived in the summer because he had to isolate straight away,” revealed Steyn. “He only trained with us for about five or six days after that, then the whole squad got put into isolation. So, basically, he spent about  days in isolation during his first month here – which can’t have been much fun.  “But he’s such a great bloke. He’s fitted in seamlessly and is making a great impact. He talks a lot of rubbish sometimes which gets the boys giggling. We make sure that he knows he’s talking rubbish … but we all know the attributes he has as a player. He’s pretty much got the complete game. “It’s great to see the new guys making such a great impact,” Steyn added. “The likes of Josh McKay [a full-back from New Zealand] as well, and we were also keen to see big Walt [Tongan winger Walter Fita] with ball in hand when he came on.  “They are all fantastic players but also fantastic guys to have around in the environment every day. They have fitted in seamlessly.” Australian No Jack Dempsey wasn’t involved this weekend but is expected to be in the frame for Exeter. His form since the start of the season will tempt Wilson to throw him straight back into the starting XV, but that would be incredibly tough on whichever one of Ryan Wilson, Matt Fagerson and Darge then misses out, because all three were superb against the Ospreys. "},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-grabbans-late-strike-sees-nottingham-forest-dump-arsenal-fa-cup","story":"The substitute sealed a - win for the Championship side to book an East Midlands derby with Leicester in the fourth round.Arsenal, -time winners, produced a disjointed performance which got what it deserved, with Forest more than matching the visitors to continue their upward curve under Steve Cooper.Four years ago managerless Forest beat the Gunners - in the third round as Arsene Wenger’s reign meandered towards its disappointing conclusion.Arsenal may now be slowly stirring under Mikel Arteta but they suffered the same fate at the City Ground to show plenty of work is required.They struggled to find a way past organised Forest throughout, with Eddie Nketiah missing their best chance and Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka closed down swtly.Nketiah and Ben White dragged off target and Albert Lokonga had a shot deflect wide during a timid first half for the Gunners, wearing all white as part of an anti-kne crime initiative.Forest were more efficient in attack, eventhey failed to test Bernd Leno, and Arteta’s concern was clear when he hauled off Nuno Taes after just  minutes.The defender, replaced by Kieran Tierney, endured a sloppy half during which a wild back pass almost caught Leno out. His frustrations were obvious, throwing his gloves to the ground without even glancing at his manager.It epitomised the untidy nature of the Gunners’ half – they were far from in control and Forest had shown glimpses of troubling them with their pace.Arsenal had plenty of the ball but Forest were never concerned during an instantly forgettable first half – which would have suited the hosts, who restarted quickly after the break.They carved out the game’s first meaningful chance when Brennan Johnson left Cedric trailing on the right and crossed for Philip Zinckernagel to test Leno.It was then Arsenal’s turn to spurn a fine chance when Saka teased Jack Colback and crossed for Nketiah.The striker had pulled off the back of Joe Worrall and had a free header from six yards but managed to completely miscue his effort and it rolled woefully wide.The game threatened to find some le and James Garner’s free-kick was well saved by Leno just after the hour as Forest pressed but it was all too brief.Charlie Patino, on his full debut, was replaced by Alexandre Lacazette having struggled to make a consistent impact, but the same can be said for his team-mates, who all lacked cohesion.It was a tedious display which belied the Gunners’ recent form. The hosts could sense their chance and when the breakthrough finally came with seven minutes left it was of Arsenal’s own making.Lokonga lost the ball in the midfield and Yates was slipped in down the right to provide the perfect cross for Grabban to slide in and win it from six yards."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Cambridge topped the list of headline makers on Saturday with a stunning win away at Newcastle. For the visitors, who sit in th place in League One, it proved to be a famous afternoon as they booked a place in the fourth round in fairytale fashion, with goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov producing a string of fine saves to preserve the lead given to them by Joe Ironside. Elsewhere, non-league Kidderminster came from behind to dump out Reading, Huddersfield won at Burnley and Nottingham Forest knocked out Arsenal. National League leaders Chesterfield scored away at European champions Cha, while Morecambe and Shrewsbury led at Tottenham and Liverpool respectively. vw,vw,px, px\"Kaide Gordon was on the scoresheet for Liverpool At  years and  days old, Gordon became Liverpool’s youngest ever goalscorer in the competition when he turned and swivelled a brilliant equaliser in front of the Kop in the - win. Gordon stepped into Mohamed Salah’s position on the right side of Liverpool’s front three. A daunting prospect, perhaps, but one which the confident and direct forward relished. The goal was a memorable moment for the highly-rated player, who was described as having “fire in his boots” by Liverpool assistant manager Pep Lijnders. vw,vw,px, px\"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta saw his team dumped out of the cup Arsenal’s only chance of silverware is now in the Carabao Cup after Lewis Grabban’s late strike stunned Mikel Arteta’s side as Nottingham Forest dumped the Gunners out of the competition again. Arsenal, -time winners, produced a disjointed performance which got what it deserved, with Forest more than matching the visitors to continue their upward curve under Steve Cooper. Four years ago managerless Forest beat the Gunners - in the third round as Arsene Wenger’s reign meandered towards its disappointing conclusion. Without European football and off the pace in the Premier League title race, it now puts huge pressure on Arsenal’s League Cup semi-final against Liverpool.The match in a minute! 🔵 pic msPuOXwjcG— Cha FCJanuary , With the tie against Chesterfield coming in between the Carabao Cup semi-final games, and on the back of a hectic Christmas schedule, Thomas Tuchel might have been forgiven for resting many of his star players. However, despite there being  places between the two teams in the football pyramid, the Cha boss paid the National League leaders the utmost respect by fielding a side that included Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, Romelu Lukaku, Mateo Kovacic, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Saul Niguez, showing just how seriously he is taking the competition. vw,vw,px, px\"Callum Wilson is out injured With Callum Wilson injured, it fell to Allan Saint-Maximin to lead the line against Cambridge. But the Frenchman is not a natural replacement – evenhe relished a free role through the middle under predecessor Steve Bruce. Jacob Murphy and Ryan Fraser also had spells up front but Mitov was in fine form and Newcastle never really looked like getting back in the game. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi were all watching on from the directors’ box and will have noted that bringing in a striker this month must now be a priority.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious. She was built especially for this purpose to give new le and to find out just how able you really are.“I#ll never forget my voyage and the wonderful friends I made and so overwhelmed at how challenges were overcome. Thank you Tenacious and thank you to the magnicent permanent crew who led and guided us all the way.”Patrick Fleming, JST’s chief executive, said: “Tenacious is the only tall ship designed to be sailed by a mixed ability crew – allowing fellow voyage crew members to join in with the day-to-day activities on board.“It’s great to hear stories from people like Mavis who’s lives have been truly touched by the experiences offered onboard.”The JST charity offers people of all abilities the opportunity to climb aboard their tall ship Tenacious for an immersive sailing experience and relies on funding from the public.

Instead, his P pupils’ parents are being told there will be no school on Monday.“What we don’t want to see is a finger pointing exercise with everyone blaming everyone ,” he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “All through the pandemic, on every issue, they have been reactionary. A failure to listen is why we’re in this state today. And now we don’t want the situation further compounded by political games and posturing.”He said the shortage of substitute teachers has been exacerbated by the decision to extend the Engage programme, which was aimed at limiting any long-term adverse impact of Covid through provision of high quality, one-to-one, small group or team teaching support“While it was a good idea at the time, what we have now is a position where substitute teachers are tied up with providing this programme and not available to step in and help out with staff shortages.”Another Co Down principal added that he didn’t want to see the Assembly debate turn into a row over what should have been done.“There’s no point at this stage looking back at what we night have done several months ago,” he said.“It should be the role of politicians to be a ‘critical friend’ when facing a crisis. Instead what we see are ‘critical opponents’. Any grandstanding does nothing but frustrate those trying to work through this.”NASUWT union official Justin McCamphill, speaking on behalf of the Northern Ireland Teachers’ Council , said current mitigations are not sufficient.“Staff absences are making it impossible for many schools toin a safe manner despite the endless claims to the contrary from others,” he said. “It is particularly disappointing that additional mitigations were not put in place prior to Christmas. The situation we now find ourselves in was entirely predictable. It seems clear that the department needs help and we have provided a list of mitigations and recommendations which we believe will go some way to restoring confidence.”Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan, who petitioned for the recall, said it was needed to provide a voice for parents, pupils, teachers and wider school staff. “The Minister needs to come to the Assembly to set out a clear plan for keeping schools open which puts the safety of pupils, teachers and parents first and deals with the pressures on school staff,” he said.Related topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblySinn FéinPat SheehanMore On Northern Ireland Assembly PremiumStormont slammed over delay in publishing MLAs’ expenses PremiumJon TongeOpinionStormont is more parish council than st century parliamentPolitical games overshadowing our education crisis, says DUPStormont Assembly to be recalled early in response to Omicron Covid surge with , cases in seven days in Northern Ireland PremiumRevealed: the NI road that’s sparked most complaints from driversMost ReadCrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £mMale model caught at Belfast International Airport carrying €k in suitcasePoll blow for Sinn Fein ambition for all-island powerNorthern Ireland’s famous faces and lesser-known names to watch out for in Comber family home is bright and beautulTop VideosPlayKate releases three striking photographs to mark her th birthday\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Alex%Murphy%funeral.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Alex%Murphy%funeral.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Funeral of IRA man Alex Murphy in BelfastPlayMurder victim shot through window in front of familyLatest EducationSDLP angry at lack of progress implementing education reportPolitical games overshadowing our education crisis, says DUPUnder strain: Six key areas where Covid staff shortages are affecting essential servicesCovid situation is ‘dire’ in Northern Ireland schools, says teaching unionAssembly likely toearly to discuss schools crisisLatestDigital Subscription: Half price for  monthsIt’s alright mate, I’ve played before – Anderson on batting out for Sydney drawBoris Johnson must be available to Downing Street parties inquiry, MPs sayRalf Rangnick reveals Edinson Cavani wants to stay at Manchester UnitedIan Wright says ‘lives wasted’ to kne crime after loss of  youth centres,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last week two men were shot in separate attacks believed to have been carried out by paramilitaries. If recent years are anything to go by, there will be many more similar incidents before the end of .However, work is continuing to bring the attacks to an end.Father Martin Magill, parish priest of St John’s parish in west Belfast, is a member of the Stop Attacks group which aims to raise awareness of the damage being caused by the violence. The group is made up of church figures and youth workers from throughout the North.Fr Magill revealed that members of the group have themselves been threatened by paramilitary organisations because of the work they are doing, but insisted they would not be deterred.“A number of our group have had threats issued to them in the past, but we believe in what we are doing and will continue on with our work,” he told the Sunday Independent.In the latest incidents, a man was shot in each leg during an attack in Dundonald, Co Down, on Monday night, while another man was hit in the leg after shots were fired through the front door of a house in Dungiven, Co Derry, on Tuesday evening. No organisation has claimed responsibility for the shootings, but local paramilitaries are being blamed.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, those involved with Stop Attacks take issue with the term “paramilitary-style attacks” when describing such incidents. They claim this implies an element of political motivation to the violence.“I see very little ideology in these attacks and that is why we use the term ‘organised crime gangs’ for those involved,” said Fr Magill who believes financial greed and a desire to exert power over others are among the real reasons for the attacks.Figures released last week by the PSNI show there were  paramilitary-style shootings in Northern Ireland in  — an increase of one on the previous year. Eight of the shootings were carried out in the Derry and Strabane policing district.The PSNI said a total of  paramilitary-style assaults took place last year — a decrease of seven in the number carried out in .The influence paramilitaries continue to exert over some communities in Northern Ireland was outlined in stark terms in a recent report. Last November, the Commission for Victims and Survivors and researchers at Queen’s University in Belfast published a report entitled It Didn’t End in : Examining The Impacts of Conflict Legacy Across Generations.The report claimed the intimidation, abuse and exploitation of children by paramilitary-style groups “remains a reality”.“Vivid accounts of abuses against children, young people, and their families were shared. The volume and scope of these demonstrates the myriad of ways in which children, young people, families and communities continue to experience coercive control,” it stated.The report also referred to an attitude described as “societal shrug” where many people ignored the issue of paramilitary attacks or believed it was someone ’s problem to deal with.“It is unsurprising, therefore, that within families and communities silence is deeply embedded. Paramilitary violence is silenced through fear and coercion, cultures that stigmatise ‘touting’, and lack of police legitimacy, but also through normalisation, denial or avoidance.“Normalisation and avoidance appeared [to be] ways of coping with and managing a threat that, while ever present, would ‘not come for you’you kept your head down.”Fr Magill said a “culture of fear” existed in all the areas where paramilitaries operate. “Part of the problem for police is that victims often will not say anything ,” he said. “Victims in many cases know who was responsible for attacking them but are just too afraid to speak out. It could be their neighbours who are involved in the attacks.”He said the attacks were carried out in both republican and loyalist areas.“The general principle seems to be that loyalists beat while republicans shoot. The figures would show that the number of beatings is much higher on the loyalist side.“There are more shootings on the republican side although recently there has been an increase in the number of loyalist shootings.”The Belfast priest acknowledged that some former paramilitaries were trying to end the ongoing attacks.“I think there are people in both the loyalist and republican communities who were involved in the armed struggle in the past as they would call it and who may even have been involved in these human rights abuses, but who have now completely walked away from that and who will exert what influence they have on some of the young people who are involved in ongoing attacks.“However, I think that some of the younger ones who are coming into this are not listening and their motivation is greed, making money and establishing a lestyle for themselves.”A new project is being set up to support the victims of paramilitary attacks in Northern Ireland.The new project is being created as part of the Tackling Paramilitarism, Criminality and Organised Crime Programmewhich was established as part of the Fresh Start Agreement in .The first phase of the programme ran from  to  and incorporated a range of projects which aimed to reduce the levels of fear and control which paramilitaries continue to exert over some communities in Northern Ireland.Funding for the programme has been extended until  and one of the new initiatives involves a support scheme for those who are attacked by paramilitary organisations.Justice Minister Naomi Long welcomed the new project, which is the first publicly funded scheme of its kind to be set up in Northern Ireland. “We need to break the cycle of harm in our communities, to free people up from coercive control,” Ms Long told the Sunday Independent.“We need to stop recruitment, but there are no short-term solutions or easy fixes it’s about turning off the tap for these paramilitary gangs.“We also know that tackling inequality, supporting vulnerable young people and supporting vulnerable communities is a key part of how we tackle paramilitarism. We do that in tandem with the work of bringing those who are responsible for these human rights abuses to justice.”Ms Long said TPCOCP has a range of projects and interventions that provide support to young people and young men who are vulnerable to being harmed by paramilitaries. “Part of this is a new project that is being established with the aim of providing holistic support to victims of paramilitary violence. We are hopeful this project will reach victims and provide bespoke support, build capacity among service providers and inform our work more generally.“Paramilitarism isn’t just a single problem. It’s a symptom and a cause of so much that is wrong in our communities.”Fr Magill is encouraged by the victim-centred approach being taken by the new project.“My aspiration is that we get to the stage where these human rights abuses are not happening,” he said.Most ReadCrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £mMale model caught at Belfast International Airport carrying €k in suitcasePoll blow for Sinn Fein ambition for all-island powerNorthern Ireland’s famous faces and lesser-known names to watch out for in Comber family home is bright and beautulTop VideosPlayKate releases three striking photographs to mark her th birthday\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Alex%Murphy%funeral.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh Alex%Murphy%funeral.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Funeral of IRA man Alex Murphy in BelfastPlayMurder victim shot through window in front of familyLatest Northern IrelandMLAs ‘need to fix school issues, not play blame game’Stormont slammed over delay in publishing MLAs’ expensesBelfast councillors to discuss motion on free public transport for young peopleIrish health service under stress, warns HSE chiefMan left critically ill following Co Armagh road crashLatestDigital Subscription: Half price for  monthsIt’s alright mate, I’ve played before – Anderson on batting out for Sydney drawBoris Johnson must be available to Downing Street parties inquiry, MPs sayRalf Rangnick reveals Edinson Cavani wants to stay at Manchester UnitedMLAs ‘need to fix school issues, not play blame game’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: Damien Storan PA WirePhilip RyanJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSinn Féin’s ambition to lead governments both in Northern Ireland and the Republic has been dealt a blow with a new opinion poll showing more voters backing the serving Irish Coalition over Mary Lou McDonald’s party.The first Sunday Independent Ireland Thinks poll reveals almost one in fourvoters say their preferred government would be the current Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party coalitionthey were forced to make a choice. Meanwhile, over a thirdsaid they would prefer a Sinn Féin-led government that included smaller left-wing parties such as the Green Party, Labour Party and Social Democrats.

Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The survey found pc of voters were unsure what make-up of political parties they would like to see in the next government. However, despite the lack of support for a Sinn Féin-led government, the party remains the most popular in the south and Mary Lou McDonald is the most popular political leader.The new poll shows Mary Lou McDonald’s party is up two points to pc, while Fine Gael is down two to pc. Fianna Fáil is up pc. The state of the other parties are: Social Democrats pc , Labour pc , Green Party pc , Solidarity People Before Profit pcand Aontú pc .Ms McDonald, with a . out of ten rating, is marginally more popular than Taoiseach Micheál Martin , Tánaiste Leo Varadkarand Green Party leader Eamon Ryan . In a further boost for Sinn Féin, more than two in fivevoters say their preference for the next housing minister is Eoin Ó Broin. One thirdsaid they wanted serving minister Darragh O’Brien to continue in the portfolio. Voters are less supportive of Pearse Dohertybecoming the next finance minister, with Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoestill more popular than his opposition counterpart. Just pc of those polled said their preference for finance minister was Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath.Fine Gael’s Helen McEnteeis the public’s most popular choice for justice minister followed by Sinn Féin’s Martin Kennyand Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan .In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin is also in poll position ahead of the Assembly elections in May, with the latest Lucid Talks showing they hold pc of the vote, which puts Michelle O’Neill in a prime position to be the next first minister. The DUP, on pc, has regained some of the support it lost to the other unionist parties but faces an uphill battle to retain the first minister position.In a bid to shore up the hard-core unionist vote, DUP leader Jeffery Donaldson last week again threatened to collapse Stormontnegotiations on the Northern Ireland Protocol are not completed soon. Mr Donaldson’s intervention was branded as “reckless” by Ms McDonald who said the Protocol was working for Northern Ireland businesses.Last week, newly appointed UK Brexit negotiator Liz Truss held meetings with political leaders in the Northern Ireland and Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney as negotiations over the Protocol continue. While the ongoing debate over trading arrangements between the EU and the UK rages on in Northern Ireland, it is very low on a list of priorities for voters in the south. The Ireland Thinks poll found just pc of voters list Brexit and Northern Ireland as priorities for the government.

Like many other organisations across all parts of society, we have been concentrating our resources on the delivery of services in these challenging times and will publish as soon as possible.”Sir Alistair, who spent three years chairing the Parades Commission, said the Assembly’s excuse was “poor” as it is “relatively straightforward” to publish expenses information, even with the Covid- pandemic.“It’s central to transparency in politics that they should do so,” he stated.“It’s central to the politicians’ accountability to the public.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Many people’s resolutions and goals for the year ahead often include giving back. We are incredibly lucky to have dedicated volunteers who come in every single week and give their time to be there for children when they need us the most. Last year, our teams of volunteers in our Childline bases across the UK had over , Childline counselling sessions with children and young people about a range of problems including mental health, abuse and neglect, family relationships, sexuality, grief, loneliness, and isolation. If you have a new year’s resolution, why not consider becoming a volunteer Childline counsellor  Volunteering can be a great way to give back to the community, whilst learning new skills. At NSPCC, we have an in-depth training process to get you ready for your volunteering role, as well as a hugely supportive team of volunteers and supervisors to guide and help you on your volunteering journey.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in .

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.

An old-school, sticky corner back, Walker was superb as Moneymore defeated Drum in the quarter final, and kept tabs on Dolans Kevin Nixon for much of the semi final. Walker was strong too in the quarter final win over Drum, producing some fine blocks and interventions to showcase his technical defending ability. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Hitting - in their semi final win over Craigbane, McElhennon has sickened defenders all year from deep. He also netted in their Ulster win over Donagh, and has shown a knack for attacking from deep with the poise and devastation of a heat-seeking missile. A key cog in Desertmartins running machine and a large part of their success this season. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Prone to a solo burst into the opposition half, he was particularly good against Drum, drawing an early save from their goalkeeper. Adept at sitting deep and playing the pivot as the men in front of him probe for a defensive opening, Moran has the game intelligence to know when to join the attack to create the overload and give the best opportunity for a score. Pic by Mary K Burke.  At the other side, Desertmartin had a mirror image of McElhennon in McEldowney, who was able to apply pressure on the opposite flank as St Martins hit teams with their speedy runners. Thrived in the space afforded to Desertmartin in their Ulster win over Donagh, and was a strong presence in their semi final defeat to Denn as well. Pic by Tom Heaney nwpresspics.  With his midfield partner Oran Kelly popping up in attacking positions, McGovern was the organiser, sitting back into the hole and looking for the opportunity to hurt the opposition. A calm head during the  final in June, he helped pave the way for that breakthrough success, using all his experience to see his side through a tough patch.  McGinleys experience and physical presence around the midfield area was a big boost for Dolans as they made their first JFC final since . An experienced head in the middle, he helped orchestrate their come-from-behind semi final win over Moneymore in Ballinascreen, and was a vocal organiser to have at centre field as he drove his team into the final. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  CDP Team of the Year : Hurling  See who has made our Team of the Year for last years hurling season.    Torturer-in-chief of a weary Moneymore defence in the semi final, McCosker hit two points and was named man of the match. His ball-carrying ability was key to that turnaround against Henry Joy McCrackens, not only resulting in his own scores, but yielding a number of frees for corner forward Odhran McKane to convert. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  McGuckin was a key link man in the St Martins side, choosing the correct option consistently and helping to probe opposition defences. Another experienced head to guide the younger players around him, the half forwards relentless movement helped create openings for the men around him, while he chipped in with crucial score of his own. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A threat all season, there was an excitement among the Moneymore side when Crozier received the ball. Comfortable running at defenders, he was a threat throughout their junior championship campaign, and was key in helping his side open up a lead in the semi final before a determined Sean Dolans side reeled them in. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Bloomer hit - against Sean Dolans in the semi final and - in a man of the match display against Drum in the quarter final. Showing a dogged determination to threaten the goal, he turned down marks on two occasions, opting to put the head down and go for the net. Both decisions resulted in a collective - as Bloomer showed a ruthlessness in front of the posts. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Murrays breakthrough season has seen him torment opposition defences with ceaseless energy and clinical finishing. His free-taking has also been a feature, and the precocious forward has been rewarded for a fine debut season at adult level with a call-up to Rory Gallaghers provisional Derry squad for the upcoming McKenna Cup. Pic by Cathal McOscar.  Had a slow start in the semi final win over Moneymore, but was clinical in the pressure of the closing stages, finishing the game with four points. His free-taking, while errant in the early stages, was slick and composed when it mattered, with the game in the proverbial melting pot as his side chased down and overturned the Moneymore lead.

The St Oliver Plunketts stopper went through the entire championship campaign without conceding a single goal, and his efficiency from kick outs helped his side to reach back-to-back intermediate finals. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Quinn organised the Greenlough defence that was narrowly beaten in a low-scoring county final, and was a tough competitor throughout. A consistent performer, he was comfortable bringing the ball out from the back and supporting his team-mates in attack. Quinn has a seemingly indefatigable engine, and a willingness to give everything to his teams cause. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Lindsay had a fine season at the back for the county champions, and presided over a defence that was not only organised, but ready to break at pace. Tasked with curbing some of the countys more lively attackers, Lindsay produced a consistent level of performance that laid the foundations for his sides Derry success, as well as the run to the Ulster final that followed. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Flitting between corner back and half back, the versatile Steelstown man was tasked with picking up Enda Lynn in the latter stages of the county final as Neil Forester pushed on, and did a fine job until the Greenlough man was forced off through injury late on. Energetic and determined, Baker has all the attributes required to be a successful defender. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Rafferty was a lively member of the Drumsurn half back line that was the fulcrum of so many of their attacks during the championship. His input was vital in the deciding league victory over Banagher, and the has had a fine season as St Matthews reasserted themselves as a force to be reckoned with during manager Sean Bradys maiden year at the helm. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Concannons pedigree and ability was crucial to Steelstowns run through the county championship and on to an Ulster final. His pace, anticipation and fitness at the heart of the Brian Oacutegs defence have been consistent over the last few seasons as they fought to make the breakthrough, and proved crucial in finally getting them over the line. Pic by Mary K Burke.  A strong runner, Kearney drove Greenlough on as they attempted to win successive intermediate championship titles. Particularly adept at winning turnovers as the opposition ran out of room in the Greenlough half back line, he was a key part of a defence that did not yield a single goal in championship football all year. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Devine was an attacking threat for Brian Oacutegs from midfield, and showed great leadership throughout their championship campaign. His experience shone through in a side that blended the seasoned and the youtful with fantastic results. Devine drove Steelstown on throughout their Ulster campaign, particularly good in their win over Donaghmoyne. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Following the injury to Niall Bradley, McCallion was asked to take on a lot of the heavy lting in the Greenlough midfield and performed admirably throughout the season. A huge presence physically, McCallions ability to win ball, both first and second, was key to his sides dominance of opposition teams during their championship campaign. Pic by Mary K Burke.  CDP Team of the Year : Junior football  Who has made the cut for the junior football final XV     McCarron has shown all his power and skill throughout the championship, not least in the last two Ulster championship games when defences have opened up. No longer an unknown quantity, McCarron has dealt with the expectation that comes with being on the county , and produced consistent quality performances in the blue of Steelstown. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Not a man in Derry would have begrudged Neil Forester the chance to lt the Bateson Sheridan Lee Cup this season. Led by example and had the experience to organise games at key moments. First shackling Enda Lynn in the final, his versatility in pressing on in the final quarter helped spark the final push that delivered delirium in the Maiden City. Pic by Mary K Burke.  His withdrawal in the final was a blow to Greenlough and gave Steelstown the boost they needed to go on and win the game. As prolic as ever during the  season, Lynn was the perfect foil for the electric Niall Loughlin, sharing the scoring burden and proving creator-in-chief for the St Oliver Plunketts side in both their league and championship campaigns. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Pace, trickery and clinical finishing are all in McMonagles locker. He nailed the pressurised free to take the Derry title and has cut loose in the open spaces of the Ulster intermediate series. The corner forward exudes a real joy in playing the game, and has shown a relish for taking on opposition defenders in one-on-one situations, often leaving them in a flap. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Again the focal point of the Plunketts attack, Loughlin destroyed Slaughtmanus with -, hit a further - against Drumsurn and - in the sticky surroundings of the county final. Followed up a fine early season showing with the county side by shooting his side to within a whisker of back-to-back Derry intermediate titles. Once again a serious threat. Pic by Mary K Burke.  Another man to take advantage of Steelstowns free-scoring plan, Murray has used his pace well. Hit a point in the county final. Murray has produced performances of such consistency throughout the season that he finished the year among the championships top scorers, and made hay in the open fields of the Ulster intermediate championship.

Pic by Ramsey Cardy Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Brendan Rogers  “Ive barely trained all week,” said Rogers after his - haul in the Ulster semi final win over Dunloy. The Emmets man had risen from his sick bed to down the Cuacutechullains, producing a superb performance in his relatively new role in midfield. A week later, he repeated the trick, finding the net against Ballycran as Slaughtneil lted their fourth Ulster title. In this form, Rogers is unplayable. He hit scores from distance. He won dirty ball. He linked the play, and at crucial moments, he took off at a canter, beat the defenders and put the ball in the net. That ability has the effect of both unsettling opposition defences and getting maroon and white-clad supporters in the the stands on their feet. In the feedback, one respondent said Rogers was an absolute pleasure to watch and a reliable, classy player. Others said his selection was an easy choice and hailed him as a match winner, while a further response said no words needed. “He is the man that has driven Slaughtneil forward this year in both Derry and Ulster championships, and has been a class act,” suggested a further respondent. One response simply said the man is lethal. The Emmets will certainly hope so, and all of Rogers attributes will be required as they head into an All-Ireland semi final meeting with either Ballygunneror Kilmallock .

Young Hurler of the Year  McLaughlin celebrates his goal against Cootehill. Pic by Seamus McQuillan Mono Pix. Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin  In what has been a breakthrough season for the Na Magha corner forward, Ruaidhriacute McLaughlin has shown plenty of promise. With his side labouring against Cavan champions Cootehill in the Ulster quarter final, it was the young star who rattled the net to calm their nerves. McLaughlin is a lively attacker, whose clever movement has the result of both creating room for himself and freeing up space for his fellow forwards. His ability to appear in the right place at the right time was recognised in the feedback, with one respondent saying he got scores when they were needed at crucial times. Another said he slotted into the team with a quiet confidence, while a further response said he was the most committed young hurler in the county. “Brilliant young player. Fantastic, consistent playing at every match. Shines at every game and is an outstanding team player, always puts the team first,” added another. A fine season in the Antrim league as well as on the Derry and Ulster scene have laid the foundations for the Na Magha man to push forward in .

Pic by Cathal McOscar. googletag.cmd.push Eunan McElhennon  In a year where Desertmartin perfected the attack from deep-lying positions, McElhennon was a key weapon. Whether it was bursting forward with the ball, or getting on the end of a sweeping move, the electric half back was on the score sheet regularly. He found the net with an outstanding inidual effort in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, and continued his scoring run throughout the Ulster championship campaign. One respondent on the feedback form pointed to McElhennons speed, strength and shooting, while another said you could play him anywhere on the pitch. A further response said he was the best half back in Derry and Ulster for his speed and skill on the ball, while another hailed him as an influential player. “He played some great, entertaining football and was very focused and smart on the field,” added another. One respondent simply nominated Runabout McElhennon, while another said he was easily the best player on the pitch in nearly every game this season. Ending the year with two junior medals to his name, along with his Desertmartin team mates, the half back can be well satisfied with his performances.

Young Junior Footballer of the Year  Murray capped the season with his first start for Derry seniors last night. Pic by Cathal McOscar. Lachlan Murray  Murray wasnt even eligible for Desertmartins first junior success this season, but their full forward was busy anyway, helping secure Ulster and All-Ireland minor titles for Derry. Eager not to miss out, he added the  junior football title to his growing medal collection, and featured strongly in the run to the Ulster junior semi final. With St Martins clearly the team to beat at this level, they faced packed defences wherever they went, with Murray having to work hard to create the space he needed. And he did. Sean Dolans Rory McGurk used his experience to curb Murrays enthusiasm in the early stages of the county final, but he did what talented young players do. The teenager adapted his game and maintained his composure to slot six points from frees as Desertmartin eventually won by ten points. One respondent to the feedback said Murray was the main man in that Desertmartin team, while another said he had a bit of everything in his game. “An exceptional talent. Eight points in the county minor final, performances for Derry minors and made the step to junior football easily,” added another. A part of Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for , there is an exciting future ahead for Lachlan Murray.

Pic by Mary K Burke. googletag.cmd.push Neil Forester  “Is this real ” yelled a delirious Neil Forester at the end of his sides championship final win over Greenlough. Youd forgive him for asking. The Brian Oacutegs captain has seen years of heartache and near misses, and when the crunch arrived in November, he produced a huge performance to finally clamber over the line. Starting the game on Enda Lynn, he pushed forward in the latter stages and marshalled attack and defence, almost omnipresent as Steelstown ended their hurt. It typied the leadership he showed all season, and he was central also as Brian Oacutegs shook off what was historically their bogey team in Castledawson at the quarter final stage. The public feedback reflected the good will towards a man very few would begrudge a county championship medal. “He puts his head where you wouldnt put a sock,” said one respondent, while another simply said he was a brilliant leader. A further respondent said he was a real GAA man. “He does it all for his club, other clubs and schools all around Derry and still puts in big performances when it matters. Heart of a lion and wise beyond his years,” they said. A hugely important player for Hugh McGraths men, Forester will continue the search for silverware this weekend as Steelstown take on Moortown in the Ulster IFC final in Glen.

Young Intermediate Footballer of the Year  The young midfielders aerial prowess was key to the Brian Oacutegs effort. Pic by Mary K Burke. Donncha Gilmore  Its been quite a year for Donncha Gilmore. He picked up Ulster and All-Ireland titles with the Derry minors and ended the year with an intermediate championship medal. The midfielder belied his years with a series of confident, mature performances in a championship where seasoned giants are in plentul supply at centre field. With the county final in the melting pot, he rose to field the ball among a scattering of players, raising a roar from the crowd and lting his team mates. The Steelstown man was a popular choice throughout the public feedback, with his exploits in the Oakleaf jersey no doubt contributing. “He has been brilliant for Derry and Steelstown, an All-Ireland winner and a Derry championship winner, with more to come,” said one respondent. Another said he covered every blade of grass throughout the championship, while another – who was liberal with the blue and yellow heart emojis – said he was pure class. In a nod to the midfielders modesty and work ethic, another response said the young man has no idea just how good he is. Gilmore can look forward to Sundays Ulster IFC final as well, and will feature in manager Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for the upcoming season.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Derry had led from early in the game when Niall Loughlin gave them the lead after just three minutes, and points from debutant Lachlan Murray and Emmett Bradley saw the Oakleafers lead by - to - at half time. Monaghan sprung a number of changes, and had five made by the time Derry introduced Declan Cassidy in the th minute, with Miacutecheaacutel Bannigan contributing - off the bench. A nd minute free from Jack McCarron nudged the away side ahead, but Ethan Dohertys immediate response levelled matters again. With the game deep in injury time, Kieran Duffy found room and sent over what the Farney men must have thought was the winner. Doherty though, broke onto a Matthew Downey through ball and with the whites of Rory Beggans eyes in front of him, tucked it between the posts to ensure Derry started the season with a draw. *Full report, pictures and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Caoimhín Doherty Jan Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Morgan Murray and Steelstown have their focus set on the club’s first ever Ulster intermediate final against Moortown at Glen on Sunday. googletag.cmd.push Steelstown are coming off the back of their first ever championship and they hope their support on the sideline will help them push on again and double their success. Murray admits his side will have to ‘dig deep’ against a strong team in what are likely to be tough conditions. “It’s evident after the county final that our fans played a big part in helping us over the line,” he said. “The support from them throughout the game was unbelievable and once that final whistle went, it was emotional celebrating with huge club figures who have been there so long. “It’s a special feeling having your family there on the day too, and when we got over the line, having them there made the victory that much sweeter.” Winning the county final was special, says Murray. Pic by Mary K Burke. The -year-old also added how he expects another big turnout despite the weather conditions. An All-Ireland semi final is the prize for the winners, but Morgan insists the ‘Oacutegs’ are not looking that far ahead. “We don’t like to get too far ahead of ourselves, we always just take it one game at a time,” he said. “Obviously,the situation comes that we’re in an All-Ireland semi final, we will be more than prepared, but at the minute, Moortown on Sunday is where our focus lies.” This is Morgan’s first year on the senior side after impressing last year with Steelstown’s reserve team. Murray admits it was a dficult campaign for himself last season with injuries and missing out on senior football. “I was training with the seniors but wasn’t getting to play with the seniors, so I was playing reserve football,” he said. “That was disappointing, and injuries didn’t help, but it just motivated me to push myself on to demand my place on the senior squad. “Reserve football gave me the opportunity to enjoy my football again. “And as I said, I was still in around the seniors, seeing how far they had gone having reached the final and seeing that togetherness, it gave me the drive to be part of it.”  CDP Team of the Year : Intermediate Football  We take a look at the players who made the final XV.   The left-footed forward’s drive and determination in last year’s campaign has landed him where he is today in the Steelstown senior squad. “Thankfully this year, my coaches have put a lot of faith in me and that’s pushing me to perform week in week out,” he said. “I’m very grateful to have had a big part in the team this year and winning the club’s first ever Championship is something that will stay with me forever.” The Pennyburn man has scored a championship total of - and earned his place in the County Derry Post’s Intermediate Team of the Year for  – alongside seven of his teammates. Going into the final, Moortown have an average of . points conceded per game while Steelstown sit at . points. The Derry men are typically big scorers in their games, but Morgan played down the signicance of the statistics. “I don’t think they’re relevant, to be honest,” he said. “It’s an Ulster championship final so anything can happen, but I’m confident that come the final whistle, we’ll have done enough to win the game.”  PREVIEW: Tyrone champions will be Ulster final favourites, says McGrath  Steelstown take on Moortown in Sundays intermediate decider.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th January,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  SportWATCH: Were going to enjoy the hell out of this for the next few days overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

So punctual in fact that East Down ACrsquos Sharon Madine missed the start of that race and so she talked herself into doing the K as penance.There were  starters with plenty of quality runners at the front of the pack, who were obviously there to do more than merely run off the turkey.The top five men broke  minutes with Gerard Heaney of North Belfast Harriers taking the win in ..The fastest female was Dearbhla Cox of Annadale Striders in .. East Down had five entrants including three juniors.Oliver Robinson led the club home in . which is a massive  seconds faster than his previous best that was set in Victoria parkrun a few months. Jacob Crawford crossed the line in . showing that the consistent training is paying off and James Wright was delighted to breach  minutes and gain a new personal best time of ..These results are a great morale booster for the youngsters. Maureen Kellyensured that the family standards were upheld when she also bagged a personal best with ..Margueritesaid that it took at least until halfway to thaw her frozen hands and she was glad to see the finish line looming.She was happy enough with her time of . and even happier to jump in the car and head home.In the K which began at .am there were  entrants. The top three finishers were in within the  minute barrier.In first place was Ben Branaghin a time of ..The top female was Gillian McCrory, representing St Peterrsquos AC, in .. East Down AC had four runners, all female and as mentioned, Sharon Madine was only there by default.Having got lost en-route and failed to get to the K start, she felt that the only way to save face was to run the K.She actually ran very well and in the end was happy to have doubled her exercise goal for the day. Her time of . placed her as th female out of  and was not that far off her personal best.This is impressive since she prefers K to K and also that she arrived with no intention of racing that distance.In addition the blustery conditions were not ideal for chasing times. Alison and Ella Carroll opted for the K over the K based on the later start and the chance of a lie in.It turned out that the rain had also eased by then so it was a good call. Alison ran a well paced race and was as pleased with her consistent splits as she was with her time of ..Ella has not fitted much training in as of late but with characteristic grit she ploughed on to the finish in a time of ..Mags Flynn slipped across the line between these two in a very respectable ..It was a well organised event with adequate parking and toilets. All entrants received a t-shirt and medal and even the poor weather did not detract from the smug feeling of achievement for those who turned out. Kudos to Glenn Grant for his efforts to make this happen.Meanwhile closer to home, the rain had cleared early on to give a bright mild day. Gordy Graham was out for the Burren Townland ten miler and said it was almost too warm.The contrast in the photos of this compared to the Belfast meet is marked. Gordy had a great race and took the win by a clear margin in a time of . but he was keen to point out that his closest adversary, Brendan Heaney, was denied the chance to race it out when he took an unfortunate tumble.Gordy had the good grace to help his rival up but it seemed that the fall took its toll and Brendan never really got back on track.He did hold on to second place but he was four minutes behind Gordy in the end. Another podium for Gordy to end a successful year. It was no surprise to find that Niall Gibney was in the mountains on Boxing Day.However, this time instead of a solo escapade, he had signed up for the annual Turkey trot organised by BARF .This arduous run started at Meelmore Lodge then headed up the lane to the Mourne Wall. The climbing continued up to Trassey Track Ford and then up to the Bernagh-Meelmore col.Niall said that the paths were like mini streams after the deluge on Christmas Day and he described the river crossing below the col as ldquointeresting.To others that probably means practically impassable but the runners toiled on finally reaching Meelmore-Meelbeg Saddle.Our intrepid mountain man reported that, ldquoFrom here the brakes were off and it was a fun fast slippery downhill to the Happy Valley. A further treacherous stretch took them along the Mourne Way back to the lane to Meelmore Lodge.A run like this requires agility as well as stamina, so not all would be fit for the challenge and indeed it was a select field of  who set out.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent.

Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only .

This body of work celebrates the humanism and psychological dexterity of us all, both inidually and as a gender sector.ldquoWorking as an inidual to support equality for both males and females is wonderful.ldquoBut, by working together to achieve it as a society. Then we are invincible and real change can happen.She added: ldquoThis is especially relevant during these unprecedented, pandemic times. Where the glass ceiling still remains almost permanently unbroken.ldquoMore importantly, domestic abuse has increased horrendously, behind shut doors during the  months of lockdown.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason is supporting the event.She said: ldquoWomen are key to the fabric of our society and the day to day working of our world. Yet, we still see women disproportionately under-represented in areas such as education employment and leadership. No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job. More work does need done to address this problem urgently.Agreeing with both councillors, Lise said: ldquoWhat the councillors are saying is so true. So passionate am I to keep female equality high on the public agenda, itrsquos the focus of the creation and touring of this exhibition. It is at the core of my lsquoI Am Womanrsquo Arts and Cultural Programme.She added: ldquoI am focused on promoting all forms of equality and ersity in Northern Ireland.The I Am Woman programme was first launched at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in September and was attended by MLAs and VIPs.But Lisersquos work is not just focused at reaching the ear of politicians.She said: ldquoMy personal agenda is more about reaching out and spreading the necessity for equality, in all formats. In all walks of our society, from both a ground level up and top down.ldquoI feel that we all have a moral responsibility, when it comes to supporting and promoting female, and other, equality here in Northern Ireland. Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now. Otherwise, females will continue to be treated as second class citizens in Northern Ireland, for generations to come.ldquoBoth males and females have so much to give our society. In order for a fairer, more democratic society to exist. Females should always be treated equally at all levels.Lise added: ldquoAfter all, it is women who make up the majority of the adult population in this country.This is Lisersquos third project to be showcased at Parliament Buildings.Any school or business interested in hosted Lisersquos exhibitions and or workshops should email LiseMcGreevyPhotographic@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13354564.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I do not trust people who are all-things-to-all-men, least of all people who seek high elected office on that basis.There were early warning signs of problems with Mr Blair, not least the way that he projected himself as almost archetypal Tory English, but also in a way Scottish, and then — when he addressed the Dail and talked of Ireland being in his blood — as Irish too.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.I also deeply disliked that ridiculous image of him entering Downing Street with a guitar.This, let us remember, is a man who wanted to be a rock star when he was younger. Not at age  or , but he actually still harboured such ambitions after he left Oxford University.I have a theory that Blair’s undoing is rooted in that specic vanity — the desire to be a rock celebrity. Because he achieved a iation on it in September  , days after the terrorist attacks in America.The then President George W Bush was addressing both houses of Congress in the US, in the fevered aftermath of the atrocities. Tony Blair, who had been the first foreign leader to speak to Mr Bush after the attacks, had flown out to America and was a special guest for the speech.The president turned at one point to the UK prime minister and said that the US needed allies like him.“Thank you, friend,” Mr Bush said.The cameras zoomed in on Mr Blair, who seemed to be suppressing his delight as the parliamentary leaders of America gave him a standing ovation.At that moment, one of the biggest television audiences in America, at a time of national crisis, was cheering the MP for Sedgefield.Think about that.No rock star has ever had a moment like it.Not even the Beatles, who tended to appeal to younger generations, have attracted the adoration of almost an entire superpower.And it was almost asMr Blair, having had the stardom that he had long sought, resolved internally never to put in jeopardy that mass affection.The rest, including his downfall, is history. As it happens I thought he was largely right about that thug Saddam Hussein, evenhe was disastrously wrong in the specics of weapons of mass destruction.I also did not like Blair’s approach to Northern Ireland. While he held firm on important unionist principles in the run-up the Belfast Agreement of , he then initiated an approach to NI politics of appeasement of republicans that has persisted to the present day.But of course he should get a knighthood!Indeed Mr Blair should have been offered it the day he left office.If we are going to be a society that has an honours systems, andthat honours system is going to have a culture known as ‘gong by rank’ , then plainly the head of government should be at the very top of the list.By the way I recall reading many years ago that ‘gong by rank’ would be phased out, and that awards would be based on achievement, not on position. But as far as I can see high court judges still get them automatically.A high court judicial position is one of immense importance and prestige, and such office holders should be worthy of the job and,so, deserving of great respect.But being prime minister is much more important still.It is for that reason that most people can remember and name every prime minister of their letime .Thus even the most short-tenured prime ministers such as Alec Douglas-Home in the s are remembered more than  years later in a way that few other public figures are known.Don’t be fooled by Boris Johnson. For most incumbents, being PM is no fun thing.Indeed perhaps a majority of inhabitants of Downing St in recent decades have emerged as damaged human beings, in some cases almost broken .How absurd that we honour pop stars with knighthoods and people who have achieved great but brief success in, say, athletics but not someone who has been premier of the United Kingdom.What a reflection on our loathing of those who do the vital job of politics.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: You can already see something of a stretch in the evenings——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy said noSinn Fein, its allies and its proxies have played a prominent role in promoting this way of thinking.They claim that unionists have been invited to join a ‘respectful’ conversation aimed at creating an ‘inclusive’ and ‘progressive’ -county republican state. This language is chosen to appeal to people who see themselves as more reasonable, rational and, let’s face it, superior to those of us who have a fixed preference for remaining in the UK.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.But do buzzwords like ‘shared’, ‘respectful’ and ‘inclusive’ really mean anything in the context of Northern Ireland’s proposed destruction  Most of the evidence suggests that they do not and we’ve seen two good examples this week.First, there was the saga of the Queen’s platinum jubilee tree. The DUP MLA, Joanne Bunting, asked for permission to plant this piece of greenery on the Stormont estate, as part of the ‘Green Canopy’ project. This is a royal initiative encouraging people to “plant a tree for the jubilee”, as an environmentally sound way of marking the th anniversary of the Queen taking the throne.Bunting’s proposal should have been uncontroversial but, unfortunately, the finance department has responsibility for the grounds around the Assembly and it is led by Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy. The request to plant a tree was denied. In an attempt to explain, the minister released a statement. “My department’s policy on commemorative structures or planting on the grounds of the Stormont estate is to approve only those requests which commemorate international events.”If nothing , this explanation was consistent, as it is not the first time Sinn Fein has vetoed horticulture it sees as too unionist friendly. Last year Murphy prevented the planting of a rose bush at Stormont to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary. The party may see everything through the greenest tinted spectacles, but it cannot be accused of being overly green-fingered.On Twitter, a former Fianna Fail candidate, Fintan Cox, described its latest decision as “shockingly petty... bordering on sectarian hatred ... a bloody tree!” There was widespread incredulity on social media that Murphy could block such a harmless gesture.Later in the week, though, Sinn Fein was involved in a similar incident and this time it complained about ... a book! The offending volume, ‘Conspicuous Gallantry’ by Anthony Leask, was visible behind the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during a Stormont committee video meeting.Maoliosa McHugh, one of Sinn Fein’s burgeoning phalanx of unelected MLAs, interrupted the call to ask the Assembly clerk for an investigation into the permissibility of displaying the publication. ‘Conspicuous Gallantry’ records stories from the men and women of the thBattalion of the UDR.Sinn Fein and others have long tried to demonise this regiment, which suffered horric casualties during the Troubles, portraying the crimes of a few rogue soldiers as systemic ‘collusion’ with loyalist paramilitaries.Allister responded, “Having blocked a centenary stone, a rose bush ... and a tree planted for Her Majesty’s jubilee, republicans now ... try to dictate the contents of my study!” McHugh justied his intervention by claiming, “Workplaces should be neutral spaces.” By this logic, anyone who occasionally works from home should conduct an equality audit of their bedrooms or kitchens, before taking their next Zoom call. The imperative to take offence can call for ingenuity at times. A contemptuous attitude to anything associated with unionism, by people who claim they wish to be respectful, is not confined to Sinn Fein. You hear similar things from nearly all the leading voices in the ious campaigns for a ‘shared’ or ‘new’ Ireland. Indeed, it is almost a prerequisite for anyone who pushes this view in the media, or even just on Twitter or podcasts. The implication is that unionists must shape the  county state while they can, because their place in the United Kingdom and their hopes for Northern Ireland’s future are about to be destroyed. These frequent outbursts actually epitomise neatly the latest wave of nationalist campaigning and it is genuinely useful to have such plain-speaking. It’s a necessary counterpoint to meaningless platitudes about sharing and respect. These campaigners are all smiles and kind words while the ‘conversation’ about Northern Ireland’s constitutional position remains entirely on their terms. When unionists articulate alternative ideas about the future or challenge nationalist assumptions, the smiles soon disappear to reveal ugly and laughably premature Irish nationalist triumphalism.So long as we hear plenty of that and Sinn Fein keep making petty decisions, fewer naive people, at least, will be taken in by empty rhetoric about a ‘new Ireland’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There are very few people alive now who witnessed those horrors first-hand, but there is a duty to ensure that future generations do not forget the horrors which came from such anti-Semitism.”The text of the Gregory Campbell’s Commons motion is: “That this House notes January  marks the th anniversary of the ‘Wannsee Conference’ where a number of German government representatives met outside Berlin in  and formalised the procedures and practical steps to deal with what was termed the Jewish question that would ultimately lead to the mass murder of millions of Jewish people and expresses the hope that people from nations across the world will take steps that current and future generations repudiate continuing anti-Semitic incidents and never forget the scale of atrocities which took place during that horrendous period of European history.”• To subscribe to the print edition and save % go to localsubsplus pg NSL see page  inside for more information. localsubsplus pg NSLhttps:www.localsubsplus pg NSLNews Letter today announces new deputy and political editorshttps:www.newsletter news national the-news-letter-today-announces-new-deputy-and-political-editors-• Lord Empey: The DUP has not faced up to its central role in creating the Northern Ireland Protocolhttps:www.newsletter news opinion lord-empey-the-dup-has-not-faced-up-to-its-central-role-in-creating-the-northern-ireland-protocol-Blackstaff Press, £.• More on ‘The Idea of the Union’ below:• Extract from ‘The Idea of the Union’ Jan : It is time for moderate civic unionism, for too long muted, to speak up or lose the Union• Extract from ‘The Idea of the Union’ Dec : Claims of past bias against Catholics are greatly exaggerated • Extract Dec : Lawfare against the UK state by nationalists cannot lose• Extract Dec : There is silence among the Irish about their relocation to Britain• Extract Dec : London is a cultural capital for the Irish• Extract from David Trimble, Nov : I feel betrayed by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which rips out the heart of the  Belfast Agreement• Book Review of ‘The Idea of the Union’ Nov : Unionist leaders should read this vital defence of NI’s place in UK• Authors of ‘The Idea of the Union’ Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union• Letter Dec : The Irish who prosper in Britain could help ease dangerous tensions by speaking up• Letter Dec : Presenter should encourage a BBC probe into anti-English prejudice in Ireland• Letter from Joe Lynam Dec : Book author is out of date about Irish voices in Britain, because we laud our contented lives in UK• Letter Dec : I can see no sign of pro Union book in any bookshops in Belfast city centre——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe latest modelling suggests Omicron cases will peak \"towards the second half\" of this month and then decline – probably more quickly than previous Covid waves.Since arriving in the UK at the end of the autumn, Omicron is now the \"dominant\" form of the virus and is \"seeded in all parts of Wales\", the first minister told BBC Radio Wales this morning.More than , new cases of Covid were reported in a single daylast week, and the nations positivity rate – the number of tests thata positive result – is at  per cent, a figure Mr Drakeford called \"really high\".\"The dficult January that we could see coming is I’m afraid with us, and the protections in place are really necessary to help us all get through the challenging weeks ahead,\" he added.There is some optimism the Omicron wave could fizzle out as quickly as it managed to spread here, as it appears to be doing in South Africa, the nation where the iant was discovered in November. And research suggests people are far less likely to fall seriously ill or require hospital treatment with Omicron, compared to the Delta strain.Mr Drakeford urged caution against \"learning too many direct lessons from South Africa\", but accepted thatthe same pattern – of Omicron infections falling as quickly as they rose – were repeated in Wales, then \"we’re in for a very challenging few weeks but that we may come out of the other side of it more quickly than we’ve done in previous waves\".Wales is currently at Alert Level Two, with restrictions mainly aimed at improving safety measures for businesses and public places, rather than closing them down.The first minister said he believed his government had taken \"proportionate measures\" at the right time last month, based on the threat of the Omicron wave. This included closing down nightclubs, but Mr Drakeford said this was a move copied across much of Europe, and clubs were generally accepted to be at a \"particularly acute\" risk of being \"super-spreader events\"..removeBut asked whether his government would have preferred a full lockdown during the current wave, the first minister said this would have been impossible without financial support from the UK Government.Englands approach to Omicron has been less restrictive, as seen on New Years Eve when Newport city centre was a comparative ghost town compared to the crowds in Bristol. Boris Johnsons reluctance to impose further measures in England would make it dficult for any devolved government to win Treasury backing for a lockdown where.Mr Drakeford suggested the playing field was not level, in terms of funding any future restrictions.\"We have had this long-standing argument with the Treasury in London, that when English ministers decide that they need to move up the levels, they know they can draw on Treasury money to do so, and we and Scotland and Northern Ireland are not in that same position,\" he said. \"So we would not be able to move to [Alert] Level Four measures on our own, because level of support you’d need to offer to the Welsh economy in those circumstances is simply beyond what the Welsh Government ourselves are able to mobilise.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere the PA news agency takes a look at five things we learned from the action.The FA Cup is still magicTHE MAGIC OF THE CUP! 🤩#CamUTD | ⚫️ - 🟡 pic gospGZj— Cambridge United FCJanuary , The magic and romance of the cup is alive and well. Cambridge topped the list of headline makers on Saturday with a stunning win away at Newcastle. For the visitors, who sit in th place in League One, it proved to be a famous afternoon as they booked a place in the fourth round in fairytale fashion, with goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov producing a string of fine saves to preserve the lead given to them by Joe Ironside. Elsewhere, non-league Kidderminster came from behind to dump out Reading, Huddersfield won at Burnley and Nottingham Forest knocked out Arsenal. National League leaders Chesterfield scored away at European champions Cha, while Morecambe and Shrewsbury led at Tottenham and Liverpool respectively.Kaide Gordon makes impact vw,vw,px, px\"Kaide Gordon was on the scoresheet for Liverpool At  years and  days old, Gordon became Liverpool’s youngest ever goalscorer in the competition when he turned and swivelled a brilliant equaliser in front of the Kop in the - win. Gordon stepped into Mohamed Salah’s position on the right side of Liverpool’s front three. A daunting prospect, perhaps, but one which the confident and direct forward relished. The goal was a memorable moment for the highly-rated player, who was described as having “fire in his boots” by Liverpool assistant manager Pep Lijnders.Arsenal’s trophy hopes rest on League Cup vw,vw,px, px\"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta saw his team dumped out of the cup Arsenal’s only chance of silverware is now in the Carabao Cup after Lewis Grabban’s late strike stunned Mikel Arteta’s side as Nottingham Forest dumped the Gunners out of the competition again. Arsenal, -time winners, produced a disjointed performance which got what it deserved, with Forest more than matching the visitors to continue their upward curve under Steve Cooper. Four years ago managerless Forest beat the Gunners - in the third round as Arsene Wenger’s reign meandered towards its disappointing conclusion. Without European football and off the pace in the Premier League title race, it now puts huge pressure on Arsenal’s League Cup semi-final against Liverpool..removeCha take the cup seriouslyThe match in a minute! 🔵 pic msPuOXwjcG— Cha FCJanuary , With the tie against Chesterfield coming in between the Carabao Cup semi-final games, and on the back of a hectic Christmas schedule, Thomas Tuchel might have been forgiven for resting many of his star players. However, despite there being  places between the two teams in the football pyramid, the Cha boss paid the National League leaders the utmost respect by fielding a side that included Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, Romelu Lukaku, Mateo Kovacic, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Saul Niguez, showing just how seriously he is taking the competition.Newcastle need a striker vw,vw,px, px\"Callum Wilson is out injured With Callum Wilson injured, it fell to Allan Saint-Maximin to lead the line against Cambridge. But the Frenchman is not a natural replacement – evenhe relished a free role through the middle under predecessor Steve Bruce. Jacob Murphy and Ryan Fraser also had spells up front but Mitov was in fine form and Newcastle never really looked like getting back in the game. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi were all watching on from the directors’ box and will have noted that bringing in a striker this month must now be a priority..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Cambridge and Kidderminster take the headlines  u FA Cup talking points article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
