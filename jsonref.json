It rained the entire day long. It was cold, it was miserable, it was wet.\u0027The young Prince had to dress up in a kilt, black jacket and white lace jabot for the Royal Family procession into Westminster Abbey.          Pictured: Michael Crawford at 11Actor Michael Crawford was an 11-year-old schoolboy when he watched the occasion with his family in The Mall. He tells the programme: ‘This brought our country together – it’s very stirring, moving and brings out great pride.’Looking at his scrapbook from the time about the Coronation he admits: ‘It was a passion. Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round. I remember how glamorous the Queen looked, this radiant figure.\u0027In one sequence, a line of carriages in the Palace courtyard prepare to transport members of the Royal Family and VIPs including Winston Churchill to the Abbey.The Prince recalls the journey in a carriage with his mother, Princess Marina, his sister, Princess Alexandra, and brother, the Duke of Kent. \u0027There was an enormous crowd and they had periscopes, a lot of them, which were strange-looking devices where you looked through a viewer, and it then went up and you could look over the heads of the people in front of you… \u0027So you had a forest of these strange-looking things which were sticking out from the crowd.\u0027The sight of the Queen\u0027s four-ton Gold State Coach with eight grey horses also transfixed him.\u0027I don\u0027t think there are very often occasions where eight greys pull a coach. You have to have as many as that because the Coronation coach weighs so much.\u0027The Prince, 75, adds: \u0027It was a wonderful occasion and it\u0027s amazing to think we are here all these years later.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Coronation In Colour is on ITV tomorrow at 9pm.

There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  More than 50 migrants drowned in the Mediterranean on Sunday, the majority off the coasts of Tunisia and Turkey. The Tunisian coastguard is pictured on patrol off the northern town of Bizerte in MayThe latest death toll was published around 7pm, after the search and rescue operation had ended for the day.The hunt for survivors would continue on Monday morning, Mohammed Salah Sagaama from Sfax\u0027s naval base told AFP.Tunisians and migrants regularly try to cross the Mediterranean to seek a better future in Europe, with 120 mainly Tunisians rescued by their navy in March after trying to reach Italy.In October, a collision between a migrant boat and a Tunisian military ship left at least 44 dead, in what Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called a \u0027national disaster\u0027.The latest shipwreck is the most deadly in the Mediterranean since February 2 when 90 people drowned off the coast of Libya, according to the IOM.Across the Mediterranean, nine Syrians including seven children drowned when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.The group were travelling in a speedboat intending to head illegally to Europe, when the boat hit trouble off the coast of the southern Antalya province, state media reports said.  Map of Tunisia locating the city of Sfax and Kerkennah island, close to where the bodies of many migrants were recovered on SundayThe oldest child to drown was 14 and the youngest just three, according to the Anadolu news agency.Six adults were reportedly rescued including a couple who lost five of their children in the disaster.Turkey was the main sea route for migrants to Europe in 2015, when more than a million people crossed to Greece.That year 3,771 people were recorded as dead or missing in the Mediterranean by the United Nations refugee agency.So far this year, 32,601 migrants and refugees have survived the sea crossing and 649 have been recorded as dead or missing.A deal struck with the EU in 2016 has drastically reduced the amount of people trying to make the sea crossing, although observers say the numbers have been ticking up again in recent months.The focal point for Mediterranean migration in recent years has been Italy, where more than 700,000 migrants have arrived since 2013.  An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

Including fares and petrol, travel would cost less than £250.The half term rip-off: Family holidays in the UK to popular...Woman tricked into having a massage by a pervert at Center...Share this articleAt the same time, chain restaurants at the UK parks, such as Café Rouge, Bella Italia, Las Iguanas and Strada, charge more for family meals than at their outlets in other places in Britain.This means Center Parcs and the food brands can take advantage of what are effectively thousands of captive customers. For example, a Rouge Breakfast at Café Rouge is £9.50 at Center Parcs in the UK, which is 60 per cent more than the £5.95 charge at a standard city outlet of the chain.          The price difference is so great that it could be cheaper for a British family to visit a Center Parcs on the Continent rather than in the UK (Pictured: a family on a raft ride at the resort in Sherwood Forest, Nottingham)At Las Iguanas a children’s meal is £7.95, which is 35 per cent more than the £5.90 the chain charges at a city centre outlet. There are also mark-ups on pizza, pasta, drinks and children’s meals at Bella Italia and Strada.It has long been known that Center Parcs hits parents in the pocket by putting up prices at its five UK holiday centres as soon as the schools break for the summer at the end of July.          What is less well known is that the prices to stay at the UK parks, with their woodland lodges, lakes, pools, and sports facilities, are so much higher than the prices in Europe.The UK and European parks are separate businesses, but the accommodation, facilities and services are similar. UK parks offer three levels of accommodation: woodland lodges, executive lodges and exclusive lodges.The standard lodges have a family bathroom, kitchen, TV, wood burner and patio. The top of range options add en-suite bathrooms, housekeeping services, a sauna, a hot tub and, generally, a games room with a pool table. A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle. It sold the European part of the business to a French holiday company and German investment group in 2003.          The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/10/4CDECA9700000578-0-image-a-6_1528018447154.jpg","title":"Pubs Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags World Cup bunting","story":"    The Air Balloon pub in Filton, Bristol.

There were angry scenes as Salvini was confronted by protesters during his visit to Pozzallo  More than 50 migrants drowned in the Mediterranean on Sunday, the majority off the coasts of Tunisia and Turkey. The Tunisian coastguard is pictured on patrol off the northern town of Bizerte in MayThe latest death toll was published around 7pm, after the search and rescue operation had ended for the day.The hunt for survivors would continue on Monday morning, Mohammed Salah Sagaama from Sfax\u0027s naval base told AFP.Tunisians and migrants regularly try to cross the Mediterranean to seek a better future in Europe, with 120 mainly Tunisians rescued by their navy in March after trying to reach Italy.In October, a collision between a migrant boat and a Tunisian military ship left at least 44 dead, in what Prime Minister Youssef Chahed called a \u0027national disaster\u0027.The latest shipwreck is the most deadly in the Mediterranean since February 2 when 90 people drowned off the coast of Libya, according to the IOM.Across the Mediterranean, nine Syrians including seven children drowned when their vessel sank off the coast of Turkey.The group were travelling in a speedboat intending to head illegally to Europe, when the boat hit trouble off the coast of the southern Antalya province, state media reports said.

An AFPTV video screen grab shows the Habib Bourguiba University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, where victims of a migrant shipwreck were taken on June 3, 2018On Sunday the country\u0027s new hardline interior minister, Matteo Salvini, headed to Sicily, one of the main landing points for those rescued at sea, to push his anti-immigration agenda.His predecessor signed a controversial deal with authorities and militias in Libya -- the key departure point on the route to Italy -- which has driven down overall arrival numbers by 75 per cent since last summer.But Salvini has pledged to go further still, vowing to cut the number of arrivals and speed up deportations.\u0027The good times for illegals is over - get ready to pack your bags,\u0027 he said Saturday at a rally in Italy\u0027s north.The latest arrivals, some 158 people, were rescued by a humanitarian boat and reached southern Sicily on Friday.Meanwhile Spanish maritime rescue units said Sunday they have picked up 240 migrants since the start of the weekend, with one person reported drowned.Migration will be high on the agenda Tuesday when EU interior ministers meet in Luxembourg and discuss the bloc\u0027s contested Dublin rule, under which would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first member country they enter.Many of those landing on the Mediterranean coast see their arrival point as a pathway to their final destination, but the Dublin rule and tightening border checks have meant migrants are increasingly stuck in southern Europe.                                                     However, while he retained the fighting tone that helped spur his rise to power, he did temper his words when it came to NGOs organising rescues at sea, which he has previously called \u0027smugglers\u0027 and accused of complicity with people traffickers.\u0027I think it\u0027s better to spend money in the countries of origin, and now if there are NGOs that want to work for free, that\u0027s fine,\u0027 Salvini said.The leader of the far-right League party also said the new government would \u0027not take a hard line on immigration but one of common sense\u0027.His fellow deputy prime minister, head of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio, has also called rescue NGOs \u0027taxis on the sea\u0027, although his rhetoric on immigration is more measured than that of the League.Salvini is on the road seeking to rally support for his party\u0027s candidates in municipal elections later this month, as part of a broader effort to boost the traditionally northern party\u0027s profile in the country\u0027s poorer south.      Billionaire philanthropist George Soros (pictured) has urged the EU to compensate Italy for migrants landing in the country\u0027But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy.\u0027This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries.\u0027That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.\u0027He suggested that the problem \u0027cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.\u0027Soros, who pledges thousands each year to help migrants, is dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after he bet against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992.He is also bankrolling Best for Britain, a campaign group dedicated to moderating and ultimately reversing Brexit.In May, he warned it could take five years for Britain to fully quit the Brussels bloc because of legal wrangling.The financier suggested the Brexit vote could be reversed and the UK could decide o stay in the EU after all.Last week, Hungary put forward controversial proposals dubbed the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill to hand out jail sentences to citizens caught assisting illegal migrants. The bill suggests that iniduals or organisations that help migrants submit requests for asylum when they are not entitled to protection be punished with up to a year in prison.It came after Soros\u0027s Open Society Foundations (OSF) announced it would be moving to Germany, leaving behind what it called \u0027an increasingly repressive political and legal environment\u0027 in Hungary. The text of the \u0027Stop Soros\u0027 bill and posted on parliament\u0027s website, said: \u0027Those who provide financial means ... or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.\u0027\u0027We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,\u0027 the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.                                                     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/21/4CE2777800000578-0-image-a-54_1528057464925.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr pictured outside Utah home looking disheveled","story":"    Roseanne Barr was pictured looking disheveled outside her Salt Lake City, Utah home on Sunday afternoon   The disgraced television star has rarely been seen since she was fired for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett on Tuesday Wolf was less than impressed that the network swiftly fired Barr after she called Valerie Jarrett the offspring of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027Everyone\u0027s been saying it\u0027s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on air in the first place,\u0027 Wolf said on her Netflix show The Break.\u0027So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they\u0027ve been openly racist for the thousandth time.\u0027The \u0027lady Hitler chef\u0027 nickname references a controversial 2009 photo shoot in which Barr dressed up as a Nazi baking cookies shaped like humans.

Including fares and petrol, travel would cost less than £250.The half term rip-off: Family holidays in the UK to popular...Woman tricked into having a massage by a pervert at Center...Share this articleAt the same time, chain restaurants at the UK parks, such as Café Rouge, Bella Italia, Las Iguanas and Strada, charge more for family meals than at their outlets in other places in Britain.This means Center Parcs and the food brands can take advantage of what are effectively thousands of captive customers. For example, a Rouge Breakfast at Café Rouge is £9.50 at Center Parcs in the UK, which is 60 per cent more than the £5.95 charge at a standard city outlet of the chain.          The price difference is so great that it could be cheaper for a British family to visit a Center Parcs on the Continent rather than in the UK (Pictured: a family on a raft ride at the resort in Sherwood Forest, Nottingham)At Las Iguanas a children’s meal is £7.95, which is 35 per cent more than the £5.90 the chain charges at a city centre outlet. There are also mark-ups on pizza, pasta, drinks and children’s meals at Bella Italia and Strada.It has long been known that Center Parcs hits parents in the pocket by putting up prices at its five UK holiday centres as soon as the schools break for the summer at the end of July.          What is less well known is that the prices to stay at the UK parks, with their woodland lodges, lakes, pools, and sports facilities, are so much higher than the prices in Europe.The UK and European parks are separate businesses, but the accommodation, facilities and services are similar. UK parks offer three levels of accommodation: woodland lodges, executive lodges and exclusive lodges.The standard lodges have a family bathroom, kitchen, TV, wood burner and patio. The top of range options add en-suite bathrooms, housekeeping services, a sauna, a hot tub and, generally, a games room with a pool table. A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle. It sold the European part of the business to a French holiday company and German investment group in 2003.          The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/10/4CDECA9700000578-0-image-a-6_1528018447154.jpg","title":"Pubs Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags World Cup bunting","story":"    The Air Balloon pub in Filton, Bristol.

A series of expert reports today showed how flammable cladding and muddled fire safety plans exacerbated the impact of the blaze          The report found there were a number of electrical appliances around the fridge which may have sparked the blaze  Officials said the fire started \u0027in or around\u0027 the fridge-freezer, but could not be sure whether a fault with the device was the cause of the fire or whether it started in another of the kitchen\u0027s many electrical items          A photo taken during the investigation shows an electrical cooking device between the fridge freezer and the window          The floor of flat 16\u0027s kitchen was strewn with wreckage of kitchen appliances when investigators got inside.

He told the call handler: \u0027Fire in flat 16, Grenfell Tower... the fridge, flat 16, Grenfell Tower.\u0027           Burn marks show the area beneath where the fridge-freezer stood. The skirting board behind the appliance had burned away          The fire started in the kitchen of the two-bedroom flat. The kitchen had sliding doors which opened onto the living room, pictured, where one of the flat\u0027s three occupants lived          Three people lived in the flat at the time of blaze. Two women had a bedroom each and a man lived in the living room  A picture taken through the front door of the flat (left) shows limited damage to the entrance hallway.

It\u0027s burning.\u0027The report also contains statements from the first and second pairs of firefighters to enter the property.One of the first pair, Daniel Brown, said he saw an \u0027isolated curtain of flame from about two to three feet into the air to the ceiling\u0027. The report quotes a statement from one of the flat\u0027s three residents, Behailu Kebede. He raised the alarm after being woken by a fire alarm and finding smoke in his kitchen          The plan show the flat. The fire started in the south-east corner, the bottom right of the image          An estimated picture of the layout of the kitchen shows a number of appliances around the freezer where the blaze started          A plan of the fourth floor shows there were five other flats on that storey of the building. Flat 16 resident Mr Kebede said he woke neigbours after discovering the blazeOne of the second pair of firefighters, John O\u0027Hanlon, said: \u0027The fridge was on the right, quite close to the window. You wouldn\u0027t recognise it as a fridge, just a charred rectangle with a bit of melted stuff at the bottom that was still alight.\u0027The window had gone by then, broken. That\u0027s when we noticed the window had completely gone. Even the frame wasn\u0027t there and we noticed that it was on fire, that the window surround was on fire.\u0027We walked over to the window and started spraying the window frame. It didn\u0027t have any effect on it, at which point I sat of the window sill and was leaning out trying to hit what I thought was the window surround.\u0027Five reports have been made available this morning.Making his opening remarks at the inquiry today, Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: \u0027The fundamental question which lies at the heart of our work is how, in London in 2017, a domestic fire developed so quickly and so catastrophically that an entire high rise block was engulfed, and how it was that 71 people lost their lives in a matter of hours, leaving family and friends in shock, grief and bewilderment.\u0027    After hearing touching testimony from the families of victims of the blaze, the inquiry is now hearing technical details  Grenfell experts condemn \u0027total failure\u0027 of stay-put advice saying over an HOUR went by before residents were told to leave via stairs - while fire doors from level 4 to 23 were \u0027non-compliant\u0027          \u0027Stay put\u0027 advice to Grenfell Tower residents from the emergency services that was in place for almost two hours after the fire began was a \u0027total failure\u0027 according to an expert witness. Pictured are ambulance teams at the scene of the blazeThe \u0027stay put\u0027 advice to those living in Grenfell Tower during the deadly blaze which killed 72 people was a \u0027total failure\u0027, according to an expert witness.Dr Barbara Lane, a chartered fire engineer who works for design consultancy Arup, added it took one hour and 11 minutes between when it became clear the safety advice had failed and when it officially changed to tell residents to leave.The advice from the emergency services was in place for almost two hours and was repeatedly told to those inside ringing 999 for help.Dr Lane\u0027s damning report said it was clear the stay put advice had \u0027substantially failed\u0027 after just 32 minutes and that it was \u0027unclear\u0027 why people were not told to flee the blaze sooner.She added black smoke had already appeared in the ground floor by this time and had reached the stairwells just 15 minutes later, meaning there was a \u0027need for the total evacuation of Grenfell Tower\u0027.Poorly performing fire doors \u0027contributed significantly to the spread of smoke and fire to the lobbies,\u0027 Dr Lane found.She wrote in her report that this failure \u0027would have materially affected the ability or willingness of occupants to escape independently through this space to the stair\u0027.It would have also hindered the ability of firefighters to rescue many people on the tower\u0027s upper floors.In 2011, the Tenant Management Organisation - which ran the building - replaced 106 flat entrance fire doors. None of the doors on any of the 120 flats - including the 14 not replaced - were compliant with the fire test evidence relied upon at the time of installation, Dr Lane found.These shortcomings would have had a number of consequences, including failure to prevent the spread of smoke and flame by leakage through gaps between the door leaf and door frame.Another failure of an \u0027unknown number of doors\u0027 to self-close after an occupant escaped would have allowed \u0027immediate\u0027 spread of fire and smoke.          \u0027Non compliant\u0027 fire doors were also blamed for the spread of the flames while firefighters \u0027may have contributed\u0027 by leaving doors openThe lobbies could therefore not be used as a \u0027safe air environment\u0027 by the fire service bridgehead, forcing it to remain below level 4 until 7.30am.\u0027This greatly reduced the time available using breathing apparatus, and so the time available for rescue on the upper floors, and particularly above Level 15.\u0027  A table from the report on the spread of the blaze shows how quickly the number of flat affected rose Firefighters may also have contributed to the spread of fire and smoke into the stairwell by leaving doors ajar as they fought the blaze, Dr Lane found.She wrote: \u0027I have identified the fact that the firefighting operations in response to the multi-storey fire may have contributed to the failure of the stair fire doors to prevent fire and smoke spread.\u0027Current evidence indicates some of the stair doors were ajar as firefighting hoses were running from the stair into the lobby. However, I currently do not know the number of doors involved, nor which specific doors, nor for how long this opening may have occurred. I cannot yet conclude whether this made a significant contribution.\u0027In one case, a fire door to the stairwell was held open by a body, the report said.The expert\u0027s evidence also blamed the building\u0027s windows for allowing the fire to spread to the combustible cladding, which led to its rapid spread up the tower.She said the window frames were not protected with fire resistant barriers but instead with \u0027combustible materials\u0027 allowing the blaze to expand unchecked.Another of her conclusions was that key bodies involved in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower understood how the new cladding system would behave in a fire, a report has said.In the report Dr Lane said: \u0027I have found no evidence yet that any member of the design team or the construction ascertained the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system materials, nor understood how the assembly performed in fire.\u0027I have found no evidence that Building Control were either informed or understood how the assembly would perform in a fire.\u0027Further I have found no evidence that the (Tenant Management Organisation) risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding system, nor have I found evidence that the LFB risk assessment recorded the fire performance of the rainscreen cladding.\u0027    Pictured: All of the 72 victims of the Grenfell fire disaster and where they lived   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/04/10/4CE4568E00000578-0-image-a-3_1528104580416.jpg","title":"Travellers dump hundreds tons building waste garbage M1 underpass","story":"    A band of industrial fly tippers had now totally blocked the underpass at Junction 12 of the M1 Motorway          Nine lanes of motorway traffic drive over the underpass which is being turned into an unofficial dump site          Piles of rubbish are now being dumped on grass verges nearby.

The reading on the IHS MarkitCIPS construction PMI remained steady at 52.5 points in May, against economists’ forecasts for a slight decline in activity from the previous month.However, Sam Teague, an economist at IHS Markit, cautioned that a renewed drop in new work “hinted that the recovery could prove short-lived”. According to the latest health check, house building remains the strongest area for the construction industry, while demand for commercial and civil engineering projects remains muted amid political uncertainty.Having come under pressure from a slowdown in consumer spending triggered by weak wage growth and high levels of inflation caused by the Brexit vote, retailers are cutting their demand for new shops, which is having a knock-on effect for building firms. Several major retailers including Marks \u0026amp Spencer have closed stores this year in an effort to maintain profits. Job creation among builders fell to a four-month low in May, while companies also continued to report skills shortages. Purchasing costs for construction firms rose sharply, particularly for fuel amid the rising cost of petrol across the UK, as well as for materials made from plastic and steel.Phil Harris, a director at BLP Insurance, said: “Office space demand in London is declining, retailers continue to hit the headlines with store closures, and while hotels and leisure are proving resilient, overall the sector is not booming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b50b94905430eb7afd56db47e0ae2a9e57b228cc/0_9_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e0683f19a6945ce1e489747df228df6","title":"virgin money offer clydesdale bank uk","story":"Boards begins talks to create UK’s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million customersThe owner of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks has improved its £1.6bn offer for Virgin Money in an attempt to create Britain’s sixth-largest bank, with 6 million customers.Virgin Money said it had begun talks with CYBG because of the improvement in the terms of the proposal, and the “substantial synergy potential” and growth opportunities.The boards of both banks said the proposed deal would create the UK’s first true national competitor to the large banks, with 6 million personal and business customers. They believe it would bring significant savings by removing overlap between the two firms, optimising IT spend and “rationalising” their operations.Share Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said he thought the offer was “somewhat lightweight”, adding that it should be thought of as a merger rather than a takeover. Given that the two boards were in discussions, Greenwood said “there is goodwill on both sides of the fence for a deal to proceed”, and he expected the offer to be formalised ahead of the new deadline of 18 June.“Whether Virgin Money (and its shareholders) will press for a further sweetener remains to be seen,” he said. “The lack of an upfront cash incentive is notable and may be a source of further debate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9b3704d3d552a1e42dc0bab7c4481af7f02d0d6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a5cf5da73c4d414c882b931c9bcfc01","title":"britain society inequality trade brexit is not the way","story":"The Brexiters are right about many problems but wrong on the solution. Poverty, inequality, low wages and job insecurity – all can be addressed without leaving the EUBrexit Britain is right. The status quo is insupportable. But the solution is not to leave the European Union. Our problems are made in Britain they can only be solved in Britain. Europe does not impede this mission rather it is indispensable. The imperative is to transform the way our country works.The poverty, inequalities and hopelessness that propelled the Brexit vote – seven out of the 10 poorest areas in northern Europe are in England, and all voted for Brexit – must be decisively addressed. Britain must simultaneously recommit to full EU membership as its benefits and the colossal costs of exit become ever clearer, and stand solidly with Europe as dark and menacing forces stalk the globe – not least an imminent transatlantic trade war and the wider threats of Donald Trump.To chase the economic moonbeams peddled by Brexiters while the values we prize are under global assault, to cower behind borders that shut out the rest of our continent, and to seek to resurrect an unachievable island sovereignty: this is a dead end that can only result in widespread suffering. That could even begin the day after Brexit next year, with widespread shortages of medicines, fuel and food as the port of Dover collapses with no Brexit deal – according to Whitehall departments’ risk assessments leaked and paraded in the Sunday Times yesterday.Brexiters dodge these truths. Intent on completing the Thatcher revolution, they want us out of the EU at any cost. While feigning concern for the state of Britain, their real agenda is wholly to embed a Thatcherite world of self-organising free markets and minimal social provision that will bring unalloyed benefit – whatever the baleful track record. They want out of Europe because it stands in their way.But two years after the referendum, the Brexiters’ “have your cake and eat it” fantasies have evaporated. There is no Brexit idend, rather the prospect of dismal economic growth and tax rises. The extra £350m a week supposedly available for the NHS turns out not to exist and instead we have an exit bill of £39bn (and rising). Then there is the up to £20bn a year cost of observing customs obligations after Brexit – an avalanche of self-imposed red tape – along with as much or more again as UK organisations expensively relocate to the European mainland.Virtually no one still claims, as they did during the referendum campaign, that we can retain the economic benefits of EU membership while leaving the European customs union and the single market. The prospect of “quick and simple” trade deals outside the EU is now recognised as delusory, particularly with Trump’s protectionist US and Xi Jinping’s China. It is the “global” EU that already has the trade deals, either done or in the making, with at least 60 countries, including Canada, Japan and South Korea – which are all in jeopardy for the UK on Brexit day. The EU is the citadel of rules-based international free trade and the international standard-setter that Britain did so much to create – and at whose centre we stood. “Global Britain” is a chimera.The economic warnings are there for those prepared to see them. Inward investment has collapsed by some £130bn over the last 12 months. The car industry fears “Carmageddon”. There is no open-skies deal with the US. Being frozen out of the Galileo project endangers our space industry. Universities fear being cut out of EU research budgets. It is the same in sector after sector.Europe’s achievements have not been driven solely by an economic calculus: they belonged to a bigger, nobler cause of representing European values, rooted in democracy. This is why any form of Brexit is a mistake. We want to share a continent where Europeans don’t fight each other, don’t prevent trade and where we allow its people to live and work wherever they like across their region. Never has Europe been so peaceful, democratic and prosperous as in the era of the EU.Saving Britain is a twin-pronged task: transforming our economy and society so they work for all while recommitting to an EU that covers our backs better than we know. Today’s laissez-faire, sink-or-swim approach to economics and society has to end instead our hijacked capitalism must be populated with repurposed businesses, motivated by a desire to produce goods and services that better humanity. New technology needs to be mobilised for the public good, while great institutions that serve the mass of people – such as trade unions, public-benefit companies to run utilities and building societies – must be reinvigorated and reshaped.A refashioned social contract should invest public money where desperately needed and raise the necessary taxes fairly. The centrepiece should be an educational Marshall plan. Part of this contract should be a stronger notion of citizenship, including a national identity card system to assure citizens that we know exactly who is here and what they are entitled to.A Great Charter for Modern Britain would hand power from Westminster to the cities, towns and counties of Britain so as to transform their localities, represented in a senate to replace the House of Lords, located in the north of England. This should be the foundation of a fully fledged written constitution.It is the Labour party – firmly pro-European and credible in its commitment to social reform – that could rally the country. The present policy of colluding in Brexit, while trying to make sure it is a Tory-authored disaster, will impose unnecessary suffering on too many. The great power of democracy is that citizens can change their minds as facts change: the Brexit refusal to countenance a second vote on grounds of its isiveness is born of fear that the people will reassess their decision. The worse isiveness is to press on regardless.Great countries find the political resource to turn around epic mistakes. The Labour party has the chance to save Britain, stand by Europe at a critical juncture in world affairs and form a great reforming government.

Get the best of ‘Canada’s downtown’ with a two-day itinerary from local writer Jim ByersMorningStart with a tour of the city’s most historic district, the St. Lawrence neighbourhood. Local historianman-about-town Bruce Bell will show you interesting views of the St. Lawrence Market (proclaimed best in the world by National Geographic) – and the historic town jail. The market is filled with everything from water buffalo sliders to smoked teriyaki salmon and fresh raspberries as deep and red as the Maple Leaf flag.Stop in the market for a class Canadian lunch: a peameal bacon sandwich at Carousel Bakery. For about £4 (C$7), you’ll get thick, juicy slices of bacon that are really more like cured ham. Other options at the market include tasty veal or chicken sandwiches drenched in tomato sauce (and sautéed onions, peppers and mushrooms) at Uno Mustachio. Want something more formal? The highly rated Biagio is nearby.AfternoonFrom the market, head east on the Queen streetcar to The Beaches neighbourhood. Toronto has a series of fine beaches along Lake Ontario, with boardwalks and bike trails that march for miles alongside shady parks. There’s decent swimming in summer, as well as stand-up paddle boarding and beach volleyball played by athletic, youthful locals. If that’s your thing.EveningStop in at the Distillery District for a local lager or ale at Mill Street Brew Pub. There are indoor and outdoor seating areas with great views of the restored industrial sheen of this historic district, once part of the Gooderham and Worts distilling empire. If you’re not a drinker, settle in for a fabulous coffee at Balzac’s (open ’til 8pm) – grab a spot on the second-floor balcony for great views of the crowds below. Shops in the area include Corktown Designs (nice jewellery) and John Fluevog for shoes, and there are several cool galleries. For food, El Catrin restaurant has a terrific patio or the super-colourful mural indoors is an equally impressive backdrop. Try the guacamole, which they make at your table, or the pork tacos.MorningTry breakfast at Over Easy, a nice cafe with just the right ambience on Yonge Street. If you want something lighter (and with fancier coffee), head instead to Dineen, just a few blocks north.To really appreciate Toronto, you need to visit one of the city parks when the weather is nice. People from all over the world congregate at open barbecues and play games or loll in the shade as the smoke from their lunch rises higher in the air. Trinity Bellwoods Park is a trendy spot in the West End, while Riverdale Park has a free farm kids will love. A trip to the Toronto Islands also allows you the park experience plus a short ferry ride (but come early to avoid crowds). Alternatively, check out quiet waterways by canoe, or admire the refurbished homes on Ward’s Island. There’s a legal nude beach at Hanlan’s Point too, near where former baseball legend Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run.AfternoonSome visitors hit the heights at the CN Tower (the highest observation area is 447 meters high) when they first get here. I think it’s best to enjoy the view after you’ve seen a bit and know what you’re looking at. You can try the Edge Walk and suspend yourself from the roof via a cable if you like, or just enjoy the scenery from inside like a normal person.Kensington Market is one of the city’s other iconic sights. It’s been an area dominated by Jewish, Portuguese and Chinese immigrants (and others) over the years. Nowadays it’s a mixture of all of the above, along with hipster joints, Caribbean spots and CentralSouth American shops and restaurants. They close the streets to traffic on Sundays and the area becomes a parade of people from around the globe. Stop at Rasta Pasta for great jerk chicken and rice (C$5 for a sizeable portion), or try Amadeu’s for a taste of Portugal.EveningA drink on the Ritz-Carlton terrace is in order. It’s in a quiet spot backing on to a small park, and they have some lovely Cuban-style drinks on the menu. Not far away is the Wheat Sheaf, billed as Toronto’s oldest tavern. And up on Dundas Street West, Rhum Corner has exceptional rum drinks and a Caribbean-meets-the-big-city feel.Finish up with dinner on Ossington Avenue, the city’s “hippest” street. Boralia makes meals based on recipes from Canada that date back as far as 1605, including mussels cooked over smoking pine needles (allegedly a recipe that explorer Samuel Champlain used in 1605). Grab a gourmet ice cream sandwich at Bang Bang Ice Cream to finish your night.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9782b4c2e169ab67c091ca14a0315538c2b5ea0f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb344b738bfdeb0a74dd95b3f74ff8","title":"a fashion lovers guide to canada","story":"Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …Tailor and designer Nigel Ruwende discovers the best sartorial talent (and places for a mid-shopping pit stop) in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Time to buy an extra suitcase …What I knew about Canada before I embarked on my one-week, three-city trip this summer was limited to a handful of sources: 90s TV show North of 60, Drake songs (which can arguably be seen as a Toronto guidebook written by its most famous resident), and the work of iconic brands such as Roots and Herschel.What I didn’t know was that by the time I left, I’d have discovered one of the most talented crops of local makers and designers anywhere in the world, eaten the best tacos of my life, and experienced a view – on the summit of Vancouver’s Howe Sound – that made me feel insignificant in the best possible way. And that’s to say nothing of the incredible people I met – and the raw energy of the country’s erse, accepting and multicultural cities. Canada really is a place without barriers – somewhere no one could feel like an outsider.I arrived in Toronto with high expectations and I can honestly say that they were surpassed. World-class boutiques, killer vintage finds and an unmistakable big town buzz. This is a city that has its pulse on contemporary fashion.Ice cream and being seen on Queen Street WestQueen Street West is Toronto’s creative and fashion hub – and somewhere that’s been on my radar since Vogue crowned it one of the world’s top three hippest neighbourhoods in 2014. It’s easy to see why. Not only is it home to high-end destination boutiques, such as Nomad, but it’s also a platform for Toronto’s homegrown talent – there are a lot of independent boutiques supporting each other in this prime location.I discovered local makers such as YNOT and Kotn, who are representing everything that’s great about contemporary Toronto as a city and Canada as a country with their designs. YNOT’s sturdy, stylish rucksacks and hardwearing jackets call to mind how connected to nature you are in Canada – even in the middle of its biggest city – while Kotn’s clean and elegant basics represent luxury in its simplest form.If you’re looking to mix local selections with high-end international pieces, head to Nomad – the boutique stocks an excellent range of powerhouse names such as Comme des Garçons and Raf Simons. My top Queen Street West tip? Take a long stroll, heading west to east, with an ice cream in hand from iHalo Krunch.Vintage finds in Kensington MarketIf you love vintage, there’s nowhere better than Kensington Market. This hip, colourful neighbourhood near downtown Toronto has a plethora of stores packed with wonderful finds. It has an amazing sense of street life too: turn any corner and you’ll find bars with small outdoor performance spaces, full of drinkers enjoying a show in the sun, or – as I did – dining at truly quirky restaurants, such as Rasta Pasta, the home of Jamaican-Italian fusion.Seeing where the magic happens at the Roots factoryRoots is probably the quintessential Canadian brand. Again, the strong connection to nature comes through in what it produces. Roots has been part of pop culture for years, yet still manages to feel current – proved by its recent collaboration with Drake. The rapper had a range of varsity jackets for his OVO label co-produced with the brand.I had the chance to visit the factory, which was fascinating from my perspective as a tailor and designer, to get an insight into its production processes. One thing is for sure: they really know their leather. It was also great to understand who makes it and why. Walking into the factory, you see flags everywhere, representing all of the different nations Roots’ employees come from. It really reflects Canada’s multicultural vibe – people bring their own roots to Roots.Cool Canadiana at Drake General StoreJust across the street from the Drake Hotel on Queen West, Drake General Store is like a souvenir shop for people who wouldn’t normally buy souvenirs. It’s a stylish space full of considered Canadiana, where all of the products have a curated feel – from the beautiful Alberta-made blanket I picked up, to the artisan maple syrup I brought for my friend who runs a cafe back home in south London. If you’re only visiting Toronto but want to get a sense of the whole of Canada, it’s the place to go.New architecture and timeless art at the Art Gallery of OntarioI was really excited to see the recent Frank Gehry extension of the Art Gallery of Ontario it’s a stunning addition to an already stunning building. Inside, I got to see some of the fantastic work by the Group of Seven – a group of Canadian landscape painters who initiated Canada’s first major national art movement.Fring’s by name, fring by natureNamed and frequented by Drake, Fring’s delivers a unique fusion of Asian and soul food under the stewardship of Canadian celebrity chef Susur Lee. Fring’s derives its name from Canadian-Caribbean patois, translating roughly to “good times remembered” – and after one meal here I’ve got no reservations in saying that the moniker fits. It’s an intimate space with a first-rate interior fit out, and the Hong Kong chicken and waffles with maple chili glaze were unforgettable.If only I’d had more than two days in Montreal. It’s a city unlike any other – a perfect blend of European charm and North American hustle. It’s also a place for those who love the finer things in life: amazing food, slick bars and very stylish people.Mont RoyalThe size and scale of the green spaces in Canada’s cities is something that I still struggle to get my head around – Montreal’s Mont Royal, also known as Mount Royal, is no exception. The vista over the city from the highest point of the park takes in all of downtown Montreal, while the walking route back downhill towards Saint-Laurent offers a great view of the nine-storey Leonard Cohen mural keeping watch over his old borough.Sheer ‘jeanius’ at Naked \u0026amp Famous DenimBrandon Svarc is a denim genius. Producing jeans under his Naked \u0026amp Famous moniker, he’s a maker who knows his product so well that he can stretch it to its limits – whether its dyeing jeans in green tea or red wine, or producing the heaviest pair of jeans in the world out of 32oz Japanese selvedge denim. The Naked \u0026amp Famous factory is right on top of the store. The denim gets made on the third floor and is sold downstairs in the Tate \u0026amp Yoko boutique.My idea of heaven at Maison CloakroomI wasn’t expecting this: a premium men’s tailoring retailer with its own speakeasy. In other words, something like my idea of heaven. Maison Cloakroom is housed in a beautiful 19th-century townhouse on Rue de la Montagne in downtown Montreal. This place sums up that distinctive Montreal feel – old and new, European and American – more than anywhere else in the city.Meeting the makers at Lowell MTLLowell MTL may take its name from the region of Massachusetts that was once home to a large population of French Canadians (Jack Kerouac the most famous of them), but it is a Montreal brand to the core – all of its products take inspiration from locations in and around the city. Mathieu Mudie and Rachel Fortin, the husband and wife team behind Lowell MTL, made the brand’s name producing premium leather accessories, but they have since expanded into stylish men’s and women’s clothing ranges.The ultimate Reuben at Dunn’s FamousYou can’t leave Montreal without trying a classic smoked meat sandwich from one of the city’s famous delis. As with any local specialty, there’s always hot debate about who does the best, but it’s hard to imagine anywhere outdoing the full-fat, classic Reuben at Dunn’s Famous – a sandwich piled impossibly high with Dunn’s famous smoked brisket, swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island sauce.Returning the favour at LovSometimes you just stumble upon one of the best places in town. That’s what happened with Lov. We found this place after taking a wrong turn en route to another restaurant. But it only took one look at what was coming out of the kitchen to convince us to stay – smart, innovative vegetarian dishes just asking to be washed down with one of Lov’s signature botanical cocktails. So good we returned the following night.By now I should have been used to just how close to nature you are in any Canadian city, but Vancouver takes it up a notch: from downtown you can be right on the water in 15 minutes walk. It’s something you can feel with the relaxed, west coast attitude of the people, and something that really comes through in the work of local makers Herschel and Dayton Boots, who have put Vancouver on the world style map.Colour and craftsmanship at the Museum of AnthropologySet deep in the leafy campus of the University of British Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology is home to a vast collection of indigenous artworks and cultural artefacts. I was lucky enough to have met Haida designer and artist Dorothy Grant at her home and studio before my visit – she gave me a real understanding of the varying colours and shapes used by different tribes. Seeing the level of craftsmanship on the totems, masks, garments and weaves on display up close was an experience I will never forget.Revolutionary fabrics at HerschelIt’s great to see such a young brand doing what it does so confidently. Herschel bags have made their mark so strongly as a street style staple since 2009 that, for me, they’ve become virtually synonymous with the idea of a rucksack. As a tailor, it was fascinating to see the work that the brand is doing in producing its own materials, such as the ApexKnit: a groundbreaking new fabric from which its makers are able to produce a single-piece rucksack.A fine legacy at Dayton BootsDayton Boots represents so much of what is great about Vancouver’s makers and the city’s style ethos. The brand started out more than 70 years ago, making boots for loggers. Today, their product is still as sturdy and well-crafted as it was then – but like so many great workwear brands, what they produce works just as well as a contemporary look. I’d recommend taking a look for yourself – the Dayton Boots factory is open to the public and right behind their flagship store on East Hastings Street.Record shopping and more in GastownGastown is home to one of the best record shops in the city – Beat Street Records, just around the corner from Gastown’s famous Steam clock.I’m a lover of jazz, funk and hip-hop and was blown away by the selections: among them releases by J-Dilla and Slum Village that I’d never come across in London, and hard-to-come-by rarities by Thelonious Monk and a load of other jazz greats. Of course, record shops aren’t the only thing you’ll find in Gastown. It’s a neighbourhood that has long been considered the spot for fine eating and drinking in Vancouver. Try Bao Down for some of Vancouver’s best Asian fusion street food.No more tacos after TacofinoAnd then there was Tacofino. What can I say about this place, other than is sells simply the finest tacos I’ve ever eaten. They were so good that I haven’t been able to find anything close since returning to London – it just feels like we’re not doing it right. But it’s not just the tacos – Tacofino also distinguishes itself with west coast-inspired ceviche, tostadas and nachos, as well as the phenomenal chilli salt wings with lime and valentina.The view to end all views, from the Sea to Sky GondolaIf you’re going to Vancouver, you have to take the Sea to Sky Gondola. It takes you over some of the most incredible natural scenery I saw in Canada, and it’s all less than an hour’s drive away from the city centre. The view from the summit was awe-inspiring, and many of the hiking trails coursing up the ascent were easily walkable for a beginner like me. It’s one of those places that makes you and your problems feel small – and all the better for it.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canadaPhotography: Momme Halbe and Taryn Paterson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4842470290d5fb7863efe963628a33044463ee8e/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37fe427e7a2c3ce398eefa41cb332375","title":"from al pacino to rupert everett why does oscar wildes legacy persist","story":"With The Happy Prince on its way and St Vincent directing a female The Picture 0f Dorian Gray, fandom for the self-declared genius is rife in 2018 “Formerly we used to canonise our heroes. The modern method is to vulgarize them. Cheap editions of great books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable.” For any given situation there is always an Oscar Wilde quotation. In this case, the situation is the canonisation, or otherwise, of Wilde himself. His position in the pantheon is entirely justified: his work is never out of production on stage and screen – but for some Wilde-worshippers that’s not enough. They want to get closer to his self-declared genius, perhaps in the hope that it will rub off on them.The latest edition of the great man is Rupert Everett, who jowls up unrecognisably to portray Wilde in his creatively depleted but corporeally bloated final years in The Happy Prince, also his directorial debut. Everett is something of a Wilde veteran, having appeared in Oliver Parker’s starry big-screen adaptations of An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, and having portrayed Wilde in a 2012 revival of David Hare’s play The Judas Kiss.But he’s got competition here. The immediate comparison will be Stephen Fry’s portrayal in the 1997 film Wilde. Despite being physically perfect for the part, Fry had a lot of sceptics to win over: he was considered a light entertainer – rather than a serious actor – at the time, but he earned a new level of respect for his laboursLess successful was Al Pacino. It is unlikely when Wilde wrote the part of Herod in Salomé he envisaged a hammy New Yorker with a bouffant hairstyle and a crumpled suit, but simply staging Salomé, twice, was not enough for Pacino he was impelled to make Wilde Salomé, a documentary following Pacino’s personal journey of Wilde discovery, with contributions from Tom Stoppard, Gore Vidal and, er, Bono. Other musicians to commit to Wilde fandom include Patti Smith and Morrissey, while Annie Clark (AKA St Vincent) is currently directing a film of The Picture of Dorian Gray with the title character as a woman.But why does Wilde’s legacy persist so strongly? It is not necessarily the case that great writers lead biopic-worthy lives, and their stories often require some embellishment – as with multi-stranded Virginia Woolf movie The Hours, or strained “how I wrote” films such as Miss Potter and Goodbye Christopher Robin. By comparison, Wilde’s life was its own work of tragedy, celebrity and martyrdom. He was ahead of his time but entirely in tune with ours.In comparison to other Wilde-worshippers, Rupert Everett has at least dismissed any direct comparisons with his hero. “He was a great intellect and I am a floozy,” he recently said. Oscar would surely have applauded.The Happy Prince is in UK cinemas from 15 Jun"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/563b34b2e2faf93c461650aac044aea5202415f6/0_29_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed4bfe7bbff468472385738fa2413090","title":"rupert everett the happy prince post webchat questions","story":"Rupert Everett’s long-awaited film about poetnovelistdramatist Oscar Wilde is on the way, and he is here to answer your questions nowWhat is your favourite Madonna albumsong?Della Morte Dell AmoreCemetery Man (1994) is one of my all-time favourite films.

Everett plays the lead role and makes his directing debut (as well as writing the script). Here is your chance to ask him questions about this – and anything else – in our webchat with him, which takes place at 1300 BST on Monday 4 June.The Happy Prince focuses on the last few years of Wilde’s life. He was released from Reading prison in 1897 and afterwards led a transient existence in European exile, reuniting briefly with Lord Alfred Douglas. He died of meningitis in 1900 while living alone in a Parisian hotel. Colin Firth plays his longtime friend Reggie Turner, and Merlin’s Colin Morgan plays Douglas. The film has already attracted good reviews at the Toronto and BFI Flare film festivals. Our own Peter Bradshaw called it “a deeply felt, tremendously acted tribute to courage”.Everett’s earlier films include Brit period dramas such as Another Country and Dance With a Stranger and, from his mid-90s Hollywood period, My Best Friend’s Wedding and Dunston Checks In. His memoirs, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins and Vanished Years, were much praised. And now he’s moving in with his mum.Post your questions now in the comment section below and follow the webchat live on 4 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fff2b300f5132098576d761fafe72bf603fdb31d/353_61_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c0104c71a5b31b5d436138f39771719","title":"germany leroy sane world cup squad","story":"• PFA young player of year not included in final 23• Manager Löw also leaves out Leno, Tah and PietersenManchester City winger Leroy Sané has been omitted from Germany’s final 23-man World Cup squad, the German federation has confirmed on its Twitter account.Sané, who won the PFA young player of year award after helping City to the Premier League title, missed out to Julian Brandt of Bayer Leverkusen, while manager Joachim Löw also opted to cut Bernd Leno, Jonathan Tah and Nils Petersen from his squad.“There are certainly better days in the life of a national coach than when you must send four great players home who would have deserved to be at a World Cup,” Löw said at the team’s training camp in South Tyrol, Italy.“You have to look at the big picture so we have a variable and well-balanced team prepared for all eventualities. We have good players on the wing in Thomas Müller and Marco Reus. Julian Draxler played a good Confed Cup, and made progress there. It was a tight race between Leroy Sané and Julian Brandt. Both have big qualities, both are good in the one-on-one duels.“Julian Brandt was at the Confed Cup, had some strong games there, and put in good shifts in the training camp too. Leroy Sane is a huge talent, no doubt, and he will be back with the team in September.”Sane has so far won 12 caps for Germany, but he has yet to find the back of the net for his national team. He has also only set up one goal.“Maybe he has not fully arrived in the national team games. Maybe that tipped the balance,” said Löw.“He did a good job against Austria, tried to work in defence, went into the transition play. No blame here. And his behaviour off the pitch was good as well.”There were places for Sané’s City team-mate Ilkay Gündogan, Arsenal’s Mesut Özil and Chelsea’s Antonio Rüdiger, as well as goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who has been appointed team captain despite his long recovering from injury.

Belgium. Good beer is essential for football. In this respect Belgium contributes the most to the game. They deserve my loyalty.Who are you cheering against? Germany. Let’s talk about something different for a change.Who are you cheering supporting? Argentina, because I want to see Lionel Messi crowned the greatest player of all time and any African or Asian country because of the underdog value.Who are you cheering against? Any western European country, because they are rich and can afford expensive soccer programs. Any other country is an underdog, even Brazil. They may be a giant but they still represent the hope of the emerging world. It’s great to see developing countries prosper in any way. AlejandroWho are you cheering for? England. With both Brexit and the physical pounding England fans are likely to take in the streets in Russia, they could use something positive for a change.Who are you cheering against? Russia. It would have been the US but, since they didn’t qualify, I will cheer against the country that appears to be controlling them. JohnWho are you cheering for? Iceland and Argentina. Iceland were amazing in the qualifiers. I assume they won’t win it so, after they go out, I’ll root for Argentina because of Messi – I’m from Barcelona.Who are you cheering against? Spain. I am very Catalan so I always want them to lose. CarlesWho are you cheering for? Argentina. They have the best footballer in the world and are the home of Maradona.Who are you cheering against? Germany and Brazil, the favourites. Neymar is a super-greedy guy who is interested in nothing but money. FranciscoWho are you cheering for? Germany. I love players who go beyond their iniduality and work as a team. What better nation to represent that than Germany? They are always strong contenders, even though they do not have a star the team is the star.Who are you cheering against? Brazil. I wish I could forget the 2002 final (the first I saw). Although part of that bad impression vanished in 2014. I really enjoyed the 7-1. MiguelWho are you cheering for? Spain. I started supporting Spain after their fabulous failure to get out of the group stages in 1998. Also Raúl was like a demigod to me when I was a teenager. I always root for the little guy, so the fact Spain was the best country to win nothing added more reasons to support them. And, of course, this great era for the Spanish national team has been a joyous ride.Who are you cheering against? Russia. They’re our bully neighbours and it’s impossible to root for them given our shared, not so nice, history. TiitWho are you cheering for? Iceland. They are our neighbours in the north and also very nice people.Who are you cheering against? Russia. Do I need to say more? TeiturWho are you cheering for? Iceland because I liked their performance and fighting spirit at Euro 2016.Who are you cheering against? I am cheering against – and I will forever cheer against – Uruguay because of how they eliminated Ghana in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. AsiamahWho are you cheering for? I supported Argentina in France 1998, the first World Cup I was old enough to understand, as Greece had not qualified – mainly because of Gabriel Batistuta and how cool he looked in that shirt. I really want to see Lionel Messi winning this. As for outsiders, I want Egypt, Iceland and England to progress.Who are you cheering against? Portugal because of Ronaldo, Brazil because of Neymar and Spain because I am still not over them winning everything. AdamWho are you cheering for? I’m one of those weirdos who would be equally happy with Argentina or Brazil winning the trophy. The European dominance of recent years is boring and I’ve always had a thing for Brazil. I became a football fan before the 2006 World Cup, so I have not seen them win it. With all the stories about famed Brazil teams of the past, I somehow feel cheated. But Messi retiring without a World Cup trophy would also feel wrong. Of the smaller teams, I normally get behind Ivory Coast (I’m a Chelsea fan), but since they’re not there, I’ll root for Costa Rica and Panama.Who are you cheering against? Germany. I have nothing against them but I never want the same team to win twice in a row.Who are you cheering for? Belgium, because I’m really tired of rooting (rather naively) for England in every major tournament and then watching them limp out each time. More importantly, though, Eden Hazard happens to be one of most joy-giving footballers, so the idea of throwing on his jersey and cheering for his side sounds like a good plan. Be rest assured, I’ll keep an eye – very reluctantly, mind you – on England too, because what’s a World Cup without agony and heartbreak?Who are you cheering against? Germany. I’m bored of them winning everything and emptying gallons of beer celebrating.Who are you cheering for? Germany, to win their fifth trophy. I was drawn to them in 1986 and 1990, so have supported them since. They now play almost impeccable football with young talents all around. DwiyantoWho are you cheering for? Argentina, just so people stop using their lack of trophies as a way to criticise Messi. Egypt could be fun with Mo Salah in such great form.Who are you cheering against? England. I think it’s legally required to root against England here and it can be quite fun. See: Iceland 2016. The sense of entitlement and delusion among English fans is quite profound, and the thought of how insufferable they and their media would be if they won is just too much to bear. Imagine Harry Kane getting a knighthood. Ugh. That said, seeing Big Sam’s reaction if Gareth Southgate brought home the World Cup would be amusing. KevinWho are you cheering for? England. They are our nearest neighbours and biggest rivals, but I support so many of their players on a weekly basis so why not at the World Cup? It boggles my mind why so many Irish get angry about hating the English and then shout for English clubs without batting an eyelid at the irony.Who are you cheering against? Russia and Saudi Arabia, due to their records on human rights. ColmWho are you cheering for? Iceland. It is impossible not to cheer for a country with a population of 335,000 who are competing at the highest level.Who are you cheering against? Spain as I’m sick and tired of them.Who are you cheering for? Spain. The reason is simple and grandiose: Andrés Iniesta. Not only for what he was, but for what he still is – he was Spain’s best player in their recent friendlies against Germany and Argentina. And that’s in a team that has Isco, Saúl, Thiago Alcântara. The man dribbles past opponents so effortlessly I’m pretty sure the stats guys don’t even count them as dribbles.Who are you cheering against? Watching teams such as Saudi Arabia or Egypt fail wouldn’t be too hard for me. The regimes are, of course, in no way the players’ fault, but even still.Who are you cheering for? France because my father is French and Morocco because we have a very big community of Moroccan people in the Netherlands, who could use some success. Who are you cheering against? Iceland. Fuck Iceland. Two years ago everybody was so in awe of their authenticity, their sportsmanship and all the people in the stands being family or whatever. “Look at that small country working so hard and really putting in a team effort.” Well, they have no talent, they’re overrated and annoying. Out with them.Who are you cheering for? I’ve always cheered for England, which perhaps isn’t surprising given I’ve supported Manchester United, followed the Premier League and lived in London for many years. Most Kiwis will probably be backing them too, as the team and Premier League get the vast majority of the football coverage back home. Funnily enough, I tend to dislike other English national sports teams, but there is something about how the football team unites the nation that really captivates me. There is also something charming about the haplessness of a team that has consistently fallen below the often misplaced expectations of their passionate, long-suffering fans across so many major tournaments that has me hoping that one day, England will finally win a major football tournament again.Who are you cheering against? Australia. Other Kiwis will tell me I should support “our cousins across the ditch” but, with our sporting rivalry and with them having caused so much sporting heartbreak and animosity over the years, screw ‘em. Peru can also do one for the dark arts they employed during our World Cup playoff with them in Lima, where they had fans letting off fireworks outside the the team hotel, had fighter jets (!) fly over the team hotel the night before the match and made our team’s bus journey to the hotel and stadium inexplicably long. Funnily enough, Australia and Peru are playing each other in the group stages. DerekWho are you cheering for? France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Iceland, Poland, Croatia, Denmark, Sweden and Morocco because I’ve enjoyed great holidays in these countries. Mainly Germany though, because they were robbed in 1966Who are you cheering against? Have a guess. Mainly because of the hype and arrogance since 1966. HughWho are you cheering for? Australia as it’s a nice country and I love their yellow and green colour scheme. Iceland, as they are are our brothers, who just forgot to gain independence from Denmark when we did.Who are you cheering against? Sweden. I want them to fail. My attitude to other Nordic countries in sport is that I cheer for Iceland, Faroe Islands and Finland, I don’t care about Denmark, and I hope Sweden score 10 own goals. If Norway can’t make it, then I don’t want Sweden to enjoy it. The Schadenfreude of watching my Swedish friends get knocked out will be great.Who are you cheering for? Initially Belgium, Panama and Tunisia. Then any team that might draw England in the knockout rounds if they qualify. But I will also put my backing behind all the African teams, plucky Iceland and the mighty Germans.Who are you cheering against? England. Why? Petty revenge for Brexit. I hope England lose at all sports for evermore. OlafWho are you cheering for? Argentina, because Messi deserves to win this cup England, because of their sympathetic team and manager Belgium, because of the attractive football they play and anyone who will deploy brave, attacking football.Who are you cheering against? Russia for political reasons and any other dull side without quality who use park-the-bus tactics. MatúšWho are you cheering for? Nigeria and Senegal. Keeping up with the African theme from my homeland, plus Sadio Mané is extremely likeable and I’m hoping for a big World Cup from him. I’d also like a good run from Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt.Who are you cheering against? All the usual favourites. I’d love a first-time winner. There have been 20 World Cups and only eight winning countries, so it’s time for someone new.Who are you cheering for? Argentina, because they have best player. If he wants to be the best player in a history, he has to lift the World Cup.Who are you cheering against? Germany, because they stopped him lifting the World Cup at 2014. YamanWho are you cheering for? France. I started supporting France due to the fine French players at Arsenal. Many people in Uganda – not just me – support the French team because of that. Arsène Wenger’s legacy is comprehensive. WambiWho are you cheering for? Peru!Who are you cheering against? The hosts. It is a joke that the competition is even in Russia. I would like to hope Ukraine would have boycotted had they qualified. PetroWho are you cheering for? I’m going all in on Iceland. I supported them at the Euros and they were fabulously entertaining. They’re an amazing underdog story. Everything about their run at the Euros was great: the reactions of the players, their part-time dentist coach, the insane commentary during their victory over England, their fans. Also, let’s have a moment of silence for Aron Jóhannsson, who apparently would have gotten more tournament experience playing for Iceland after all. Áfram Ísland!Who are you cheering against? England. The squad is overhyped as a non-English Arsenal fan, I can’t root for a team containing that many Spurs players and the reactions of English fans and media to their tournament disasters are very funny. Steve McClaren’s face and reaction to Iceland scoring that second goal at the Euros will never stop being funny. I also still fondly remember the reactions to the 2010 World Cup result, especially the “EASY” headlines about the group stage. I would say I’m also rooting against the other Concacaf teams, but I can’t seem to muster the requisite anger. I’m still more angry at US Soccer for screwing up qualifying so badly than I am at Panama for stealing the last spot. RachelWho are you cheering for? Iceland and Australia because of their underdog status and because Bristol City, my club team, have players from these countries (Bailey Wright for Australia and Hördur Magnússon for Iceland).Who are you cheering against? England to wind up my dad when they are embarrassingly knocked out. I’ll also be cheering against Switzerland after the poor way they scraped past Northern Ireland in qualifying. Maybe also Serbia for knocking us out. So Brazil and Costa Rica through from Group E for me! JoshWho are you cheering for? Ghana have not qualified so I don’t think I’ll support any of the African teams. Germany and Spain play good football.Who are you cheering against? I’ve never been a fan of the way Russia and England play – it bores me.

According to HMRC, you are disqualified if you have “freehold or leasehold interest of a residential property”.I read somewhere that owning a park home means someone cannot be a first-time buyer, but I assume that is residential. Other than that I haven’t been able to find any information on this matter online. CSA You don’t have to be a prospective first-time buyer to qualify for the government bonus of up to £1,000 a year that comes with a lifetime Isa in which you can save up to £4,000 a year.

However, to use your Isa savings – including the government bonus – towards property purchase (rather than for your retirement from the age of 60) you must be a first-time buyer.And you are right that you are not deemed to be a first-time buyer if you have ever owned any interest in land anywhere in the world that is freehold, leasehold (where the lease was longer than 21 years) or commonhold. In addition, the “interest in land” must not comprise “a building that is used – or suitable for use – as a dwelling”, which includes holiday homes even if they cannot be used all year round.Whether your boyfriend counts as a first-time buyer will depend on the agreement drawn up with the caravan park regarding the land on which it sits. If his agreement gave him “exclusive occupation” of a particular area for more than 21 years, he will own the land as leasehold and so his ownership of the caravan would stop him being a first-time buyer of other property. However, if his agreement with the park contains a provision that the caravan can be moved to an alternative pitch at the site at the park owner’s request andor gives the park owner free access to the land, it makes the agreement a licence to occupy the land rather than a leasehold. If it is a licence, it doesn’t affect your boyfriend’s ability to say he is a first-time buyer despite having a caravan. So he would be able to use savings from a lifetime Isa to put towards the property purchase without paying a penalty to withdraw funds before the age of 60.What neither you nor your boyfriend can do is use savings in a lifetime Isa to buy a caravan, other type of mobile home or houseboat as they do not “provide a legal interest in land”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2c59285912ea176646bc23d00ca5464aabfecff/0_27_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b60f9a2c32cc1b35baa1f9b593f9792d","title":"reliable builder websites traders","story":"We examine how the main websites that list tradespeople measure upForget sun, sand and sea. For many, this summer will be all about skips, cement and the builder’s drill. For those planning home improvements, the key question will\u0026nbspbe where they can find a reliable tradesperson.Some 45,000 people called Citizens Advice last year seeking help with their home improvement and maintenance problems, and the Federation of Master Builders estimates cowboy contractors cost the UK economy £10bn a year.So which of the websites that vet traders should consumers turn to?On this commercial site, traders pay to quote for jobs posted by customers, who can then leave feedback about them. The identities and qualifications of traders who apply to join are verified, and data analysis tools are used to check they have not been banned in the past and that the reviews are by genuine customers.Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services. Traders have the right to reply, and a decision about whether to suspend their membership is made within 72 hours. “We get threatened with legal action all the time by traders, but we don’t bow into pressure to remove bad reviews,” says Peter Wellock, head of customer service.Another commercial site where traders pay to quote for jobs and the qualifications of those who apply to join are verified. Rated People speaks to every trader by phone or in person before they apply. One out of every four are blocked by its screening process, which includes fraud and credit checks. Those accepted typically pay £55 plus VAT per month on average, which allows them to quote for a limited number of jobs. Negative feedback is published immediately and flagged up to customer services.Between five and 15 of the 90,000 jobs posted per month end in a dispute, says chief executive Celia Francis. “Often, the tradesperson will fix the problem and the customer will take the review down.” Sometimes, customer services will refer both parties to a mediation service, which costs each of them £25. The ultimate sanction is removal of membership.A commercial directory of 29,000 vetted traders who pay a minimum of £70 plus VAT per month to be listed. They have to pass a face-to-face interview and provide a minimum of five references. Qualifications and public liability insurance are examined, and background and identity checks carried out. All traders must agree to a code of conduct and allow Checkatrade to talk to Trading Standards about their work.Customers can review work online or via a Freepost postcard. Negative feedback is published within five days as long as reviewers give Checkatrade permission to contact the trader about the complaint. The tradesperson will then be allowed a right to reply and encouraged to put things right. The website may also decide to remove the trader from its directory.This is a non-profit, government-endorsed scheme intended to raise standards among tradespeople. Registered firms that are members of 32 recognised trade bodies and scheme operators, which have been vetted by TrustMark, can pay £40 a year to display its logo and be listed on the website. Currently, around 12,500 businesses are on the site.Traders have to sign up to a code of conduct and undergo background checks on their identity and business. They will also receive an on-site inspection at their place of business and at a site where they have carried out work.Work quality is checked by an expert, so users do not need to rely on reviews from other customers, says chief executive Simon Ayers. Those with complaints will be able to take up their issue with the trader and their scheme operator.An independent, not-for-profit directory of 3,550 vetted traders, run by Trading Standards and supported by 56 local authorities. Only those who have been trading for at least six months may pay £125 plus VAT to apply to be listed. A Trading Standards officer will then audit the business. Background and financial checks are done to look for criminal convictions. Previous customers are randomly selected for\u0026nbspreferences, although the work is not inspected.The website has access to a Trading Standards database and can check traders aren’t generating complaints to Citizens Advice, says the directory’s operations manager, Rachael Holden.Any claims traders make about their business or qualifications are verified. Only traders who pass this audit and have a complaints procedure can join.Which site works best? All five were tested with a search to “refresh my garden” in Cambridge so that costs could be\u0026nbspcompared.No one on MyBuilder wanted to quote and only one Rated People gardener, who was not affiliated to any scheme and did not list any qualifications on his website, offered a quote but wanted to visit the garden.When called, he said he charged £180 a day for labour and was available to start in two weeks. When the job was not offered to him, he called back two hours later to stress he had\u0026nbsp“bought” the job from Rated People. He had 15 five-star ratings out of 15 possible reviews.The Checkatrade directory gave details of two firms within five miles that had been given feedback in the past month. Both had more than 50 reviews and scores of 9.8 and 9.9 out of 10. The first refused to give a quote without visiting the garden, but promised a gardener would then be available to do the work within two weeks. The second quoted £350 per day for two people’s labour, but was booked up until\u0026nbspSeptember.On TrustMark, a trader who was a member of the Association of Professional Landscapers, the Horticultural Trades Association and Buy With Confidence quoted £320 to £350 per day for two people’s labour over the phone, but said he was booked up until early next year.The closest Buy With Confidence landscape gardener, who was a member of the Gardeners Guild and the Countryside Management Association, and a Green Flag Awards judge, said he was too busy to take on any work until next year.Visiting all five directories, reading the reviews, checking out inidual websites and qualifications, and making phone calls took well over an hour but achieved little. In the end, it was a relief that a landscape gardener was not needed after all. The ideal trader would have been both a member of TrustMark and Buy With Confidence whose work had been inspected by an expert in their field, as well as being a business approved by a Trading Standards officer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d942cb31b802dc4ec5d435d1bd00722cf6a7350/292_620_2201_1320/master/2201.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b2a517d9cf93fc0e91798b3f70a7c83","title":"how we made funkadelic one nation under a groove","story":"‘A woman came up on stage butt-naked and started blowing smoke rings out of her private parts’We’d played a gig in Washington DC and afterwards two young girls, LaTanya and Darlene, came up to the car and told us it was was the best concert they’d ever seen. They said: “It was like one nation under a groove.” As soon as I heard that, I knew it had to become a song.Initially, all I had was a hook – “One nation under a groove, gettin’ down just for the funk of it.” In the studio, once we got a rhythm together, I pretty much ad-libbed the rest. I wanted the silky feel of the Dionne Warwick records with Burt Bacharach – a smooth groove, but funky.The line “So high you can’t get over it, so low you can’t get under it” was used by the Temptations in Psychedelic Shack, but it actually goes back much earlier, to gospel. I also took a catchphrase used by the Mantan Moreland chauffeur character in the Charlie Chan movies, when he was ready to run from the ghost: “Feet, don’t fail me now!” And the line “Dance your way out of your constrictions” is about people’s hangups: you can deal with them by being grumpy or with a smile.At the time, I had three bands – Parliament, Funkadelic and Bootsy’s Rubber Band – that were all basically the same people. That gave us a better chance of survival. One Nation could have been a Parliament record, but Funkadelic needed a hit. The guitar solo made it more Funkadelic.I credited Darlene and Tanya on the One Nation Under a Groove album cover. For me, the song was about bringing humanity together, because the real problems are gonna come when we’re dealing with other planets and we have to worry about aliens coming to eat us or fuck us with five dicks.The freedom extended to the music. We were mixing funk, rock, soul and psychedelia. One Nation Under a Groove was already well under way by the time I was called in to overdub my parts. The studio was like a party. George was behind the console and would give me the melody and I could play whatever I felt. I had one of the first guitar synthesisers, and was trying to get it to harmonise with my guitar. I hadn’t really mastered it, so kept the solo simple.I always took One Nation Under a Groove to mean that some of the world’s problems are too big to change, so we might as well just groove. We’d play it until we felt like stopping – it could last half an hour. One night, as the spaceship started taking off, the drum kit got tangled up, so went up in the air with it. Another night, a woman got on stage butt-naked and was blowing smoke rings out of her private parts. I was a young kid, five feet away with my guitar, thinking, “How do I follow that?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70b5f3221bc8b3f6e7be0a376cefe677d8778ead/656_871_4267_2560/master/4267.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfdedc84b3243a6e8aba4a75a08ec0a4","title":"siegfried review mark elder halle bridgewater hall manchester wagnerian","story":"Bridgewater Hall, ManchesterMark Elder is a superb Wagnerian, drawing a tremendous performance from the Hallé and vivid power from soloists in this semi-staging of the Ring-cycle opera Mark Elder and the Hallé opened their exploration of Wagner’s Ring with Götterdämmerung in 2009, adding Die Walküre and Das Rheingold in 2011 and 2016 respectively, before completing their cycle with this often momentous performance of Siegfried, semi-staged by Gerard Jones and spread over two nights.Siegfried is traditionally dubbed the scherzo of the Ring, as if we are to think of it as something lightweight between two grander, darker statements. The description is wide of the mark, though, and in many respects this is the most difficult opera of the four to accomplish successfully. The tone, embracing nightmare as well as humour, is ambivalent. The dramaturgy, with its colloquies and monologues, has something of the austerity of classical tragedy, and stretches of the work can seem uneventful if not carefully handled. Then there is the problem of the title role, the most strenuous and taxing in Wagner’s output: great interpreters have, regrettably, been few and far between.Elder is a superb Wagnerian, acutely conscious of the complex relationship between tempo and pace, and immaculate in his judgment both of the  of each act and the ebb and flow of detail within it. Thrilling climaxes alternated with moments of astonishing beauty and quiet, almost exquisite terror. The roaring jubilation of the forging scene overwhelmed with its excitement. The Forest Murmurs have rarely sounded so ravishing. Mime’s paranoid fears of Fafner opened up expressionistic vistas of hallucinatory intensity, and there were intimations of great tenderness in the love duet, which in lesser hands can teeter on bombast. Marvellously responsive, the Hallé played with deep fervour and a burnished warmth of sound.The title role was sung by Simon O’Neill, an established Siegmund and Parsifal: Siegfried is new to his repertory. He used a score, while the other performers sang from memory, which meant that he wasn’t as fully integrated into Jones’s simple yet effective semi-staging as he might have been. His voice is fractionally too small for the role, his tone metallic and cutting rather than immense, but he brought a clean sense of line to music that these days is too frequently yelled or barked. His singing was under-characterised, but there were flashes of insight in the gratuitous glee with which he attacked Gerhard Siegel’s Mime and the wonder with which he gazed on Rachel Nicholls’ sleeping Brünnhilde.There was some splendid singing elsewhere, however. Siegel, a former Siegfried himself, made the most wonderful Mime, by turns sympathetic and horribly malign, while Martin Winkler, exuding sinister charisma, was an equally outstanding Alberich, among the finest of recent years. His scene with Iain Paterson’s sorrowful, knowingly ironic Wotan was a real highlight, as was Paterson’s anguished later colloquy with Anna Larsson’s tragic Erda. Nicholls, a fine vocal actor, sounded radiant in her long duet with O’Neill. Ultimately though, the performance belonged to Elder and the Hallé, whose achievement was simply tremendous.• At the Edinburgh international festival on 8 August.

The proposal will anger many Eurosceptic MPs, but Open Europe – a thinktank that in the past has provided some of Downing Street’s most senior policy European analysts – says the government has to shift position both to unlock the polarised political debate and to meet demands clearly expressed by British business.The proposal will be taken as another sign that the tide of opinion is shifting away from a free trade deal in which the UK gains little access to EU markets in return for the right to full regulatory ergence. The Open Europe compromise has strict limits since it suggests the UK should be free to regulate itself in services – the bulk of the UK economy – and should not accept a customs union or a common external tariff.It also suggests the UK could be allowed to decide for itself whether it wishes to accept new EU regulations in goods, so long as it acknowledges that rejection of such new regulations would limit future UK market access. The paper assumes that the UK will negotiate a standstill agreement until December 2020 in which the UK maintains all of its obligations and market access but plays no role in setting rules.However, a long-term willingness to accept EU rules in the field of goods would require a greater role for the European court of justice, or at least a judicial dispute resolution mechanism informed by the ECJ rulings, and would also set limits on the UK’s ability to negotiate its own free trade deals. The compromise will be seen as significant step forward by European business leaders, many of whom are due to meet Theresa May on Monday in Downing Street. The proposal is largely endorsed by the Eurosceptic former chancellor Norman Lamont in a foreword to the pamphlet. “There is an argument that Britain could commit to preserving the existing body of EU rules and regulations on goods,” he writes. “Business has already adjusted their systems to make products to meet these requirements.”The pamphlet’s authors say: “Giving up some control – or sovereignty – over goods regulation is a price worth paying for strong market access. Manufacturers in highly regulated industries often follow EU rules anyway, in some cases even in the US.“The debate at the moment is polarised between hardline leavers who refuse to accept giving up any sovereignty whatever the economic costs, and extreme remainers who want to either reverse the referendum result or at least recreate the entire structures of the EU from the outside. This is not where business or the public are. A sensible compromise recognises that giving up a little sovereignty can deliver good economic benefits, but there are diminishing returns in asking for more.” The detailed talks over a future trading relationship are due to be held at a June meeting of the EU council, but the run-up to the meeting has been overshadowed by the inability of the UK government to come up with an agreed proposal on the Northern Ireland border. Open Europe claims its compromise should be welcomed in Brussels since the EU already allows countries such as Switzerland and Ukraine very high levels of access to the single market in goods, in return for their broadly following the EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73954129ec1fd7c52bbe3ac25a08e4338a17961d/0_183_3772_2263/master/3772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a70485d2a866c8f16cb3b99d8a7e5c","title":"can you solve it world cup arithmetic","story":"The puzzle that shoots and scoresThe World Cup is almost upon us, so here’s a puzzle to get you in the mood.England, Tunisia, Belgium and Panama make up Group G.

A version of this puzzle appeared in his column in the Strand Magazine in 1921.A twist on Dudeney’s idea has the table include blanks, as if your coffee spilt on the sports pages and obscured some of the numbers.

Training overran. The England forward is in intensive preparations for the hockey Women’s World Cup, which begins at London’s Lee Valley park in seven weeks’ time. Not that she’s complaining.“It’s all go, go, go,” she says from Bisham Abbey. “We just finished training and we ran over slightly. Next we’ve got a team meeting, and that’s before our next training session. It’s a lot of work. Our gym work is based around being really buff, being strong and preventing injury. To be honest, I don’t think I appreciated it was such a key factor for performance athletes, and it really is brutal. But we wouldn’t have it any other way.”Listening to Defroand run through the schedule of her working week could get you out of breath by itself. It’s double sessions every day, with an emphasis on gym work. Even the rest day, on Wednesdays, is used by many players for swimming and yoga to help their muscles recover from the rest of the week. The Thursday sessions are the most notorious, though not for their physical demands.“Thinking Thursdays” recreates a match scenario but for a game nobody has played before. By changing the rules (two points for a goal, for example, or points for entering the shooting circle), players have to literally think on their feet breaking the habits they have formed and creating new ones. Defroand loves it.Playing club hockey for Surbiton, Defroand is a full-time athlete, benefiting from UK sport funding as part of the Great Britain squad. The 23 year-old’s career has run in tandem with professionalisation and, after graduating from Birmingham University in 2016 with a masters in sports science, she became part of a new generation able to dedicate themselves entirely to the sport. “I submitted my dissertation a couple of weeks after the girls won gold in Rio,” she says. “It’s really been lucky, the timing of it all, it’s been a natural progression for me. I finished university, was able to trial for the squad and now I’m living my dream.”Defroand made her Great Britain debut in February and her current training is as part of that group. Like most of the GB squad, however, she will be representing England at the World Cup. The relationship between the two teams is a fluid one (and, indeed, England earned their second-placed seeding at the World Cup in part thanks to GB’s performance in Rio) and it was while playing under the flag of St\u0026nbspGeorge that Defroand got her first experience of tournament competition at the Commonwealth Games this year.“I will always remember that first game,” says Defroand. “The moment when I stepped out on to the pitch. We’re a sport-mad family and I’d always watched the Commonwealth Games as a kid, every one. I wanted to take a step back and think, you know? To think, wow this is it, this is why I’ve trained so hard. I looked into the crowd and my mum and dad were there and that’s just such a proud, proud moment for myself.”In the countdown to the World Cup, England hockey has encouraged its players to share details of their sporting role models as part of a campaign called Behind Every Great Player. There is no doubt about Defroand’s inspiration her mother, Gill.“My mum has been the biggest influence for me growing up and becoming the hockey player that I am,” she says without a moment’s hesitation. “I got into hockey through her. I started playing at age seven because I used to watch her play every Saturday at our local club in Havering.“Mum would say that I’d steal her stick at half-time and be running up and down the pitch. By the age of 10 or 11 I was lucky enough to be playing in the same team. Since becoming a team-mate my mum’s been my club, my county and my regional manager. She’s my biggest fan and my biggest critic and this campaign is about trying to get that relationship between parent and child, get that support network, because it does make such a difference in sport. My mum has been such a fundamental part of my journey and I can’t thank her enough.”The Lee Valley is not far from the Defroand family home, which adds an extra local flavour to a competition already being billed as the biggest ever women’s sporting event on UK soil. Every England match is sold out and, after winning bronze at the Commonwealth Games in a strong field, the onus is on the hosts to match or better their\u0026nbspperformance.As Defroand counts down the days until the first centre pass, she is typically bullish about England’s potential. “You’ve got a mixture of experience and youth. You’ve got a real blend of pace but complete composure in our team,” she says.“I think we would be kidding ourselves if we didn’t think we could get on that podium. That’s what we focus on day in day out to make sure we get these major medals. Over the last year we’ve come away with a European bronze, Commonwealth game bronze so why not go a few better this summer with our home support behind us?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/588401c97878cda74465f352a4e9d77b0a7832be/0_183_4072_2443/master/4072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036df047ed82da80b1369f5a4fd97a0d","title":"building site refitted headingley cricket retains charm yorkshire","story":"Redevelopment has become commonplace at the Test venues of England, with cricket moving out of grounds and into arenasJos Buttler’s second six flew straight past the television cameras on their temporary gantry, high over the building works and into the rugby ground beyond. It was a thing of beauty, even if the barren concrete of the empty half‑built stand added a sprinkling of 21st‑century bathos.The clank of hammer on a half-cooked redevelopment has become common as cricket grounds compete to upgrade and refit earn and hold on to their Test status. The haphazard enlargement of Headingley over the years has made her an unprepossessing but good-natured old girl. She is a little careworn about the edges, with a bit of extra heft here and there, but there is a twinkle in her eye and a sharpness to her very expensive new shoes.Much has changed since the crowds poured in to watch the first Test here in 1899, when Jack Hearne got a hat-trick against Australia and rain forced a draw.A carcass of steel forms the skeleton of what will be the new Emerald stand, squeezed between the Headingley pavilion and the White Rose stand, the Western Terrace as once was. From the numbered blue bucket seats at the end of the White Rose, where the smell of frying from the Sausage Shack swoops up to tempt the hungry or the hungover, the guts of the new development are clear. Red and yellow rigs of scaffolding, a looping, cursive roof, a hamlet of tents, rubble and skips, stand shameless behind barriers.The building work that started as last season drew to a close will continue until May 2019, in time for the Ashes Test and the World Cup. As the adjacent rugby ground is rebuilding at the same time, constructors have had to use all their powers of trickery to nurdle huge machines through one little gate and between two very valuable bits of grass.The new stand will seat 4,300, making the total capacity of Headingley 18,350 – valuable extra bodies. The rugby and cricket grounds will share conference and banqueting suites, and from 2019 will combine catering and bar facilities. All of which will help combat the high-stakes financial mess Yorkshire found themsleves in, muddled further by the ground’s areas of shared ownership.David Warner, sage of the Yorkshire press box, remembers a time when the ground was lower, greener, and a little more rough around the edges – when men “turned the tins” in the famous old scoreboard at the Kirkstall Lane end, and there was a bowling green where marquees were put up for refreshments at big matches.“Until the start of the 1980s there was what was known as the Coconut Shy at the Kirkstall Lane end,” he says. “You could just see heads poking above the white background which acted as a sightscreen. Behind it was a long row of Canadian Spruce trees which enclosed the ground and made the ball swing.”But though lines of terraced red roofs still cascade upwards and away behind the North-East stand, the trees are long gone. There is no space for sentiment as Test cricket marches away from grounds and towards arenas.Lord’s remains a place of architectural beauty, despite the building of the past few years – most recently the new, very green, Warner stand. Last autumn, the members at last agreed on a new £194m redevelopment which will not be completed till 2032. Trent Bridge, too, remains lovely, though the building of the Fox Road stand and the New Stand led to a peculiar microclimate that encourages the ball to swing.Old Trafford, which lost its place on the Test rota temporarily, has been transformed since thousands queued overnight to snaffle tickets for the final day of the 2005 Ashes game. The square has been reorientated to north-south, silencing forever the many harebrained schemes put forward to combat the brightness of the setting sun. The pavilion has been rebuilt and is now flanked by two huge red pillar boxes – the Point and the Players and Media Centre. A new Hilton hotel has replaced the faithful Old Trafford Lodge many still miss the club’s hanging baskets.The Oval grows ever bigger, ever more unabashed, and the proposed redevelopment of the Lock and Laker stand and an extension to the Mickey Stewart Members’ pavilion will take capacity to 28,000, while a big bullring-style pavilion has replaced the old one at Edgbaston.And so cricket is played at bigger, bolder, if bleaker venues.

In this situation, the couriers were treated like employees in terms of their working hours and the GMB union contends they should be treated as employees in terms of their rights too.”The case is the latest in a string of gig economy legal disputes challenging what unions say is bogus self-employment among couriers and other drivers. The GMB won a landmark judgment against Uber in 2016 and others, including Deliveroo, Addison Lee and CityLink, are all involved in ongoing legal action.The case is being handled by solicitors Leigh Day. Partner Nigel Mackay, a specialist in employment and discrimination law, said seven drivers – including two who had been dismissed – were involved in the claim at this stage and he expected that number would grow. One of the drivers described his experience of leaving the house at 6am, not returning until 11pm at night and as a “thank you” for his hard work, had £1 per undelivered parcel deducted from his wages. On more than one occasion he was told by the company that he would not be paid if he did not complete a route and had sometimes driven when “half asleep at the wheel” in order to ensure he got paid.Two of the members are also claiming that they were dismissed because of whistleblowing, claiming their roles were terminated because they raised concerns about working practice. These included that the number of parcels allocated to drivers resulted in excessive hours andor driving unsafely to meet targets, and that drivers were expected to wait a significant time to load their vans, extending their working hours.  GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: “The day to day reality for many of our members who deliver packages for Amazon is unrealistic targets, slogging their guts out only to have deductions made from their pay when those targets aren’t met and being told they’re self-employed without the freedom that affords.”“Companies like Amazon and their delivery companies can’t have it both ways – they can’t decide they want all of the benefits of having an employee, but refuse to give those employees the pay and rights they’re entitled to.” “Guaranteed hours, holiday pay, sick pay, pension contributions are not privileges companies can dish out when they fancy. They are the legal right of all UK workers, and that’s what we’re asking the courts to rule on.”An Amazon spokesman said delivery providers are contractually obligated to ensure drivers they engage receive the National Living Wage and are expected to pay a minimum of £12 per hour, follow all applicable laws and driving regulations and drive safely. “Allegations to the contrary do not represent the great work done by around 100 small businesses generating thousands of work opportunities for delivery drivers across the UK,” he said.He added: “Amazon is proud to offer a wide variety of work opportunities across Britain – full-time or part-time employment, or be your own boss. Last year we created 5,000 new permanent jobs on top of thousands of opportunities for people to work independently with the choice and flexibility of being their own boss – either through Amazon Logistics, Amazon Flex, or Amazon Marketplace.”In April, the delivery company Hermes, which delivers packages for retailers such as Next, Asos, John Lewis, Topshop and River Island, began a legal battle with eight of its own drivers. It is under pressure to settle after rival delivery firm DPD offered all its drivers sick pay and holiday pay as part of wholesale reforms to its gig working model sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed and died.In 2016 the ride-hailing firm Uber was told its drivers should be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights.Uber, which says its drivers are self-employed, lost its appeal against the decision last year but said it would appeal again. The case could end up in the supreme court this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7003ab1b960fbc075d6230cfc9da82abd1e61f/0_215_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f96834a6910a1ed8b11d8914469935","title":"elon musk visionary space travel fell back down to earth","story":"The champion of clean energy and space travel, who was on a trajectory seemingly forever up, is now locked in battle with the same media which once feted himOnce upon a time Elon Musk was our era’s real-life Tony Stark, a billionaire Iron Man streaking across the sky with technology to save the planet and take us to Mars.Reusable rockets, electric cars, solar power, he did them all, taking time out to advise Robert Downey Jr on how to play the Marvel superhero on a trajectory seemingly forever up, up, up.Now Musk, 46, is literally and figuratively in a long, dark hole. He is tunneling beneath Los Angeles to create a prototype underground transit network which, he says, can save the city from traffic congestion. A noble goal. But a recently released video of the tunnel plus a map of potential lines coincided with a dark turn in Musk’s fortunes and reputation, creating the impression of a man in a labyrinth of his own making.His car company Tesla is hemorrhaging money and credibility. Unhappy shareholders want to dump three directors, including Musk’s brother Kimbal, from the board. Lawsuits tangle his clean energy company SolarCity.The entrepreneur has responded to negative headlines by lashing out at the news media and inidual journalists.“Holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them,” he tweeted last week, ire stoked by a damning report about Tesla factory safety. Musk followed up by calling journalists sanctimonious twisters of facts beholden to advertisers – and proposed a remedy. “Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article \u0026amp track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor \u0026amp publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda.”For some of his online supporters – he has 21.9 million Twitter followers – this was a call to arms. They piled on journalists with abuse and threats.For Musk skeptics it was further evidence of his burrowing into ethical murk. Instead of Iron Man here was Gollum, erratic and vengeful, scrabbling with trolls.“Going after the free press because they’ve been critical of your company is not how a CEO, visionary or even an adult reacts to criticism and it has real-world consequences,” Roberto Baldwin wrote in the technology blog network Engadget. Other outlets have weighed in, excoriating Musk as a thin-skinned bully who wouldn’t recognise journalistic independence if it rode a blazing meteorite over California. “The Donald Trump of Silicon Valley,” declared the New York Times.The bold champion of clean energy and space travel now locked in battle with the same media which once feted him as a visionary. How did it come to this? One possible answer: Tesla has skidded into trouble and Musk is blaming the messenger in apparent hope of soothing skittish investors and potential investors.A year ago Wall Street was toasting the company. Its market value surpassed that of Ford and General Motors thanks to sales of the battery-powered Model S sedan, a pioneering autopilot system and the promise that a $35,000 economy version of the Model 3 would soon roll off assembly lines, turning Tesla into a mass market auto-maker.Breaking into a market of gasoline-focused giants to make stylish, emissions-free cars adored by customers was a remarkable feat. Few others had dared, let alone succeeded. Musk’s public presentations inspired an evangelical vibe among cheering audiences. Then came setbacks. Tesla recalled 126,000 Model S cars to fix bolts. Crashes raised troubling questions about autopilot systems. “Production hell” – Musk’s words – plagued the Model 3. The long-promised economy version has yet to emerge, undermining Tesla’s claim to be a mass market player. The company reported record losses and burnt through $750m in cash in the last quarter. Its stock, credit rating and valuation plunged amid speculation about bankruptcy. Tesla will likely need a big cash infusion to survive. “More bad press for Elon: the car Elon Musk launched into orbit has fallen back down to Earth and crushed Malala Yousafzai,” blared a headline this week. This time it really was fake news – a satirical article from Clickhole, a spinoff from the Onion. “Hell of a week,” he tweeted. The Pakistani human rights advocate ran with the joke and tweeted that she was keeping the car. “Finders keepers,” he responded.It was a fleeting, lighthearted interlude in his toxic response to genuine bad news, a mix of scorn and conspiracy theory aimed at delegitimising reports of Tesla woes.“Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‘You’re just like Trump!’” he tweeted. “Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no one believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago.“Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks \u0026amp earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies \u0026amp gasdiesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers.”His followers have followed up with invective against inidual reporters, especially female ones, a misogynistic streak detailed in a Daily Beast article. “It is as though they’ve invested their own identity as males into Elon and his work,” said Shannon Stirone, a science writer.When not gaslighting online, Musk’s fans can unwind by using handheld flamethrowers: his tunnel company, Boring, sold 20,000 at $500 each. A good investment for the impending zombie apocalypse, said Musk.Amid the tide of criticism it is easy to overlook Musk’s achievements, and some nuance.The South Africa-born boy who designed and sold a video game, Blastar, by the age of 12, is self-made. He studied economics and physics and minted a fortune at PayPal before upending space exploration with audacious innovation.He sets impossible targets, for example in fuel efficiency, said one SpaceX engineer, on condition of anonymity. “We tell him it can’t be done, then spend months working around the clock and deliver maybe half the target, which is amazing, but we’re almost apologetic.”SpaceX set a new milestone in February by launching the Falcon Heavy, the first time a private company has sent such a powerful rocket into space, paving the way for even bigger rockets to potentially carry humans to Mars. “It’d be pretty cool to die on Mars, just not on impact,” Musk once joked to the . (His representatives declined an interview request for this article).Unlike most CEOs Musk engages with customers and journalists, albeit mostly via Twitter. He has told his more trollish supporters to cool it. “At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence \u0026amp abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all.”The media sometimes misses or chooses to miss his humour. Naming his putative journalism credibility rating site Pravda may not be hilarious but is hardly an attempt to recreate the Soviet propaganda mouthpiece. And yes, many journos are under pressure to get max clicks and earn advertising dollars.The reason Iron Man fell to earth, however, is that reality overtook the hype. He dazzled investors with an image of mass produced Teslas which so far remains a mirage. Maybe Musk can yet make it real – the jury is out.Blasting the media is a tantrum or smokescreen, perhaps both. Either way it is straight from the Trump playbook, though in this case the media are not lying, hypocritical liberal ideologues but lying, hypocritical shills for Tesla’s fossil fuel rivals.That narrative may play out underground too if the media keep reporting skepticism about Musk’s vision of a Los Angeles labyrinth, with some calling it a plutocrat’s fantasy, others a boondoggle.A recent public presentation hosted by Musk was tightly controlled – no TV cameras, entry by reservation, pre-approved questions – and packed with a cheering crowd. The last question: “Will you organize a big party before the tunnel launch?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92d89080fcd8bc6cd21d45c36223db7097570e98/141_10_1848_1109/master/1848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfd10b26fa7c6673e7e729330dc8c35a","title":"microsoft is buying code sharing site github say reports","story":"Company is changing its focus from the Windows operating system to tools for developersMicrosoft is reportedly buying the code-sharing site GitHub, a developer-focused startup that has become a crucial part of the programming industry since it was founded in 2008.The acquisition would mean Microsoft further cementing its role as a company built around tools for developers, part of a pivot away from its flagship Windows operating system started by its chief executive, Satya Nadella, four years ago.According to Bloomberg, which reported details of the potential acquisition, the deal could be announced as soon as Monday. The terms are unclear but at Github’s last fundraising round, in 2015, the company was valued at $2bn.More than 24 million developers worldwide use the website to host code and collaborate on programming tasks. The vast majority of those use the site for free, with the trade-off being that the code they share must remain public. Users can pay for private accounts, while larger companies can pay more for the ability to host GitHub’s platform on their own private servers. The paid-for features reportedly bring in around $200m in annual revenue.“The enterprise offering will fold nicely into Microsoft’s other businesses,” the analyst Ben Thompson of Stratechery wrote “but … the real win for Microsoft is not incremental peanuts in enterprise revenue but winning hearts and minds with developers broadly. “In other words, not only should sceptics not be worried about Microsoft unduly favouring their own platforms, they should also be excited that, more than any other potential acquirer, Microsoft is likely to push the inidual and community aspects that make GitHub so unique.”GitHub’s ubiquity has led to some unconventional uses. GreatFire, the activist campaign that works to disseminate information blocked by Chinese web censors, uses GitHub as a distribution platform, ensuring that China cannot block the material without also severely harming its domestic technology industry. The government tried, in 2013, but lifted the ban five days later after an outcry from Chinese coders.In recent years, GitHub’s popularity as a platform has disguised problems within the business. It has been without a chief executive for almost a year and its revenues have been outpaced by its expenditure, with net losses in the tens of millions.Microsoft, for its part, has slowly been repositioning itself from being focused on the Windows operating system to a broader suite of developer-focused services, including its Azure cloud platform – the largest competitor to Amazon Web Services – and the Cortana AI suite. In March, the chief executive, Nadella, finished the reorganisation, axing the Windows ision entirely and splitting its responsibilities between a consumer-focused group, led by a former Microsoft Office head, and a developer-focused one, led by the company’s cloud and enterprise chief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9ba840a7534c2c9cded932f3b1540e02379857/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e5ecf0d997af6e72eaac5a068e3b749","title":"it is ridiculously intense in there the creators of love island on the shows return","story":"Adele and Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite dating show is back. The people behind the phenomenon talk villains, meta constructs and marriages on the horizonWe get very precious about the concept of love but I think we can all agree that adding a competitive element to it improves it manifold. That’s why ITV’s Bafta award-winning Love Island was so good last year: as well as having some special alchemy in the cast (the bromance of Chris and Kem the very baffling posh-normalness of Camilla Thurlow, history’s least likely reality star), there was just something about the third series that made it the most addictive, talked-about show on summer TV.At its peak, 2.9 million viewers tuned in to Love Island, a show that, at its core, is a simple format where a series of evil producers mess relentlessly with very horny Instagram models. Last year it became a national conversation about horny Instagram models, though, and pulled in everyone from Stormzy to Jeremy Corbyn to Liam Gallagher as a result.If you’re not familiar with the format of the show, it’s this: 11 extremely attractive twentysomethings are put into the garden of an island villa and presided over by Caroline Flack. All of them shave every single follicle of their body hair and have never had to pay to get into a nightclub. They are forced to couple up based on who-fancies-who in a sort of coy high school dance routine, where they all step forward if they like each other, then Flack leaves and it turns instantly feral. For the following seven weeks they share beds, swap beds, gyrate on one another, carousel from one relationship to the next, and hook up with or bin off any one of a succession of 25 or so similarly eligible types who are flown into the villa as the series goes on.Crucially, they also have emotions, and at the end of the show four or five couples go forward into a live final and the UK votes for the winner. At that point they all jump fully clothed into a swimming pool and out into a new and unusual proto-world of fame, where they have a million followers on Instagram but your mum doesn’t really know who they are.“People used to say to me: ‘Oh, it’s my guilty pleasure,’” ITV creative director Richard Cowles tells me over the phone. “And last year they dropped the guilty, and just said: ‘It’s my pleasure.’” Series four is on the horizon, and it’s set to be the biggest ever (the show will run for a new-high of eight weeks 95,000 horny Instagram models applied to be in the villa this year).Here’s what to expect:In 2016 it was Terry, a neck tattoo that got a bit out of hand and grew arms and legs and a cold, cheating heart in 2017 it was Mike Thalassitis, a dead-eyed mega-shagger hewn by the gods out of wood a man I’m pretty sure was designed in a lab to make girls on holiday cheat on their boyfriends back home. This year there will be another one: a man around the age of 26, with a deep tan and flinty emotionless eyes who will leave three weeks later to a succession of wave-and-point club appearances, an inbox full of DM slides and a sideline in posing in boohooMAN joggers on Instagram while holding his villainous hands in the prayer sign. This year that man is looking like Adam, a personal trainer and gym director from Newcastle upon Tyne who admits having cheated and even walked out mid-way through a date, or possibly student and construction worker Niall, who reckons his chat is “up there”.Of the six couples who left the island last year, only two are still together. Montana and Alex split a couple of weeks after the show wrapped, because he was spectacularly annoying. Olivia and Chris managed a single series of an ITVBe spin-off show about their love before it got too fiery to handle. Winners Amber and Kem split after the sheer volume of work they got as a result of the show pushed a wedge between them, a snake-eating-its-tail of a breakup. Gabby and Marcel, the show’s one shot at true magical love, split after he cheated on her in a Mexican hotel where they were staying (there is no normal way of breaking up with someone once you’ve met them on Love Island). The only couples who endured are Camilla and Jamie, who are frankly too normal to break up, and Jess and Dom, who are the inverse: two reality show-circuit savants, two beautiful bodies with idiot heads who know that they are stronger and more marketable together than they ever could be apart, last seen having a fake wedding ceremony on Good Morning Britain on Valentine’s Day. Jeremy Kyle was there. The bride wore a bikini (there is no normal way of getting married to someone once you’ve met them on Love Island).Last year there was an entire man called Harley, a boulder-headed, mostly silent sweet boy who got binned off by Camilla after the first week and then went out of there to live his life, permanently wounded and impacted by Love Island, a show he was on for six days. For 23 days there was an entire woman called Chloë who dumped former Love Island contestant Jon Clark to be on series three of the show (she dumped Jon in real life), only to get voted out three weeks later after failing to couple up, and so got back with former Love Island contestant Jon Clark (who is also on Towie now: please keep up) only for them to break up again (again: in real life). You had forgotten these people existed, hadn’t you? They danced for you, they loved for you, they lifted weights in the scorching Mallorcan sun for you, they bled for you. You forgot about them. And now they sell booty tea to 400,000-plus Instagram followers, and pose neatly in off-brand baseball caps, and so they will for the rest of their living days, amen. This could a natural fit for 20-year-old engineer Wes, one of 2018’s new contestants, who has already gained Instagram numbers with his kickboxing videos (yawn).If you want an idea of how the cast of sexbots becoming self-aware can ruin this show, look no further than last year’s addition of Craig Lawson, an Essex-based personal trainer who lasted six days in the villa before being dumped. Craig was one of 11 new additions to the island on Day 26, and made an immediate bee-line for newly heartbroken (and People’s Princess for the outside world) Camilla Thurlow, whom he then spent a relentless few days bigging up. “You’re, like, really, really special,” Craig would say, practically turning to the cameras and winking as he did it. “I like your eyes.” The audience at home saw straight through this naked attempt at a couples photoshoot in OK!, as did Camilla: she dumped him at the next recoupling a few days later.“That was someone who was maybe trying to coat-tail on to something,” narrator Iain Stirling tells me, “and it was so transparent. For the first few hours people were like: ‘Oh, this is great!’, then within hours they were like: ‘Ah, see what you’re doing there, mate.’ Thing is: he was a sweet, nice guy, but in relationships you can’t hide: in that villa you’re screwed.” As both Stirling and Cowles are keen to point out, it’s basically impossible to sustain an act in as intense an environment as the Love Island villa – and, if nothing else, relationships expose the real you anyway. “If anyone can pretend to be someone they’re not, while developing a relationship, and keep that up for eight weeks,” Stirling says, “Mate? Let them have the million Instagram followers. They’ve earned it.”It happened last year, it happened the year before, and it will happen in 2K18: two permatanners from Kent who met six weeks ago in front of Caroline Flack will make each other the first person to whom they’ve ever said “I love you”, in glorious HD. “It is ridiculously intense in there,” Cowles says. “If you’re at a beginning of a relationship in normal life, you might go on a couple of dates a week, you might see your friends in between … it’s a long process. In the villa it is inescapable. So you might get to the point in a relationship in the villa in one week that might take six months in the real world. So yeah, they do fall in love. That fast-track relationship means those feelings do get stronger quicker.”What starts as quite a lightweight show about Tinder’s most right-swiped singles all coupling up and shagging quickly turns weirdly tender and romantic as the weeks and facial sunburns progress – and therein lies the deep appeal of the show: real people feeling real-ish emotions for men they’ve only ever really seen in swimshorts. “I think it’s a real cultural shock for a lot of them,” Stirling says, about the literal feeling of falling in love. “You couple that with it being on a TV show which, for that age range, is the biggest thing their friends have watched: it’s going to be a mad experience.” Watching tightly wound, rise-and-grind gym freaks slowly uncover emotions in their large muscular bodies is one of his favourite parts of the show, and the watching audience, too. “The amount of blokes in there who are like: ‘I’m the No 1 heart-throb in my city, I’ve never seen a girl for more than three minutes, blah de blah de blah,’ and then one girl shows them some attention for three minutes, and they immediately fall in love with that person,” Stirling explains. “It’s great. And you just watch this journey take place.” That’s what makes his favourite type of Love Island contestant: not the game-players, not the drama-starters, but the wounded heroes. “I love someone with a flawed character,” he says. “I basically want 19 Hamlets in there. Nineteen fit Hamlets.”Series four of Love Island is on ITV from 4 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539a45873a85756d6292e62a0595de48a5936bf7/0_49_2379_1427/master/2379.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dea628607ef9b29a7240678eb3f3c3a","title":"father ted only fools and horses rise sitcom musical","story":"A number of comedy classics are being reinterpreted for the stage as ‘joke-box’ musicals. Can they avoid the pitfalls of previous sitcom adaptations? Commercially, this is logical. Almost all recent hit musicals have featured either a story familiar from elsewhere – a Roald Dahl book (Matilda) or a movie (Strictly Ballroom, School of Rock) – or already-recognisable songs from, say, Meatloaf (Bat Out of Hell: The Musical), or Carole King (Beautiful). But, with most of the Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley back catalogues now musicalised, new corners of popular culture needed to be mined. The adaptations of Father Ted, Only Fools and Horses and Goodnight Sweetheart suggest a new theatrical trend – the joke-box musical. One promising aspect of the projects is the talent involved. The Father Ted show is written by its TV creators, Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, with music from Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy, who wrote the sitcom theme tune. Only Fools and Horses comes from Jim Sullivan – son of John Sullivan (1946-2011), the TV comedy genius who created the series – and stars Paul Whitehouse. Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, creators of Goodnight Sweetheart, have also written the spin-off, encouraged by the success of Dreamboats and Petticoats, their jukebox musical based around 50s and 60s hits. More ominous is TV comedy’s poor record as the source of West End and Broadway shows. Acorn Antiques: The Musical (2005), adapted by Victoria Wood from the spoof soap opera featured in her sketch show, received a savaging from the ’s Michael Billington, who described it as “a load of slack, self-indulgent rubbish scandalously overpriced at £65 for a stalls ticket” – although a later cut-down version in Salford was better received. Harry Hill’s I Can’t Sing! The X Factor Musical, staged at the London Palladium in 2014, was spectacularly less successful than his TV work. Joke-box musicals have been an equally iffy proposition in the US. Sung and danced versions of Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Addams Family, Bewitched, Gilligan’s Island, I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners have either failed to reach Broadway or been critically assassinated there.  One reason that sitcoms have resisted orchestration is that, whereas the two-hour length of an average movie neatly fits a standard stage slot, a TV series may provide tens or even hundreds of hours of material, including cherished whole episodes that fans will know almost by heart. In this respect, it feels sensible that Linehan and Mathews have conjured up a new storyline, beyond the scope of the TV show, in which the Craggy Island parish priest unexpectedly becomes Pope Ted. This seems a clever way of keeping favourite characters while side-stepping the audience’s desire for karaoke renditions of beloved lines and moments. The latter pressure is an obvious obstacle for Only Fools and Horses: The Musical. The TV show’s single most famous moment – in which Del Boy falls to the floor while attempting to lean nonchalantly on an unfamiliar bar – is a carefully structured TV sight gag that would be difficult to reproduce in the vast wide-shot of stage picture. Apart from interrupting the script, there is also the risk that the lyrics would fight it. Both sitcom dialogue and good songs tend to be end-loaded towards clinching lines. A Dad’s Army musical would presumably have a number for Captain Mainwaring called Don’t Tell Him, Pike!, and another in which Corporal Jones reflects, of the British empire’s enemies, that: They Don’t Like It up ’Em! But it seems unlikely these punchlines would gain from being sung rather than said. Perhaps for this reason, a show called Dad’s Army: The Musical, which was staged in Britain in 1976 and revived in 2004-05, had a score that consisted of the TV series’s spoof-period theme song (“Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Hitler?”) and genuine 1940s compositions. The guess is that Marks and Gran’s Goodnight Sweetheart will also use the soundtrack of its era.If either Father Ted or Only Fools and Horses do succeed as musicals, there will inevitably be copycat projects. My hunch is that John Sullivan’s Just Good Friends might suit musical adaptation, as its on-off romantic story is well suited to the genre. But Are You Being Served? The Musical could be a camp classic, as the Mr Humphries solo “I’m Free!” almost writes itself, although the obvious torch song for Mrs Slocombe might struggle, as online rhyming dictionaries offer, for her signature word “pussy”, only “hussy”. But, sung in a northern accent, it could just work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ae7a4bc709183579eebebf60dc3680ce48925dd/0_137_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b8c2b395d7eb6a6415c85352b857eb","title":"beto orourke texas senate ted cruz election","story":"Beto O’Rourke has pledged to visit voters in all 254 Texas counties, most deeply Republican. Could this neighborly approach give an outsider the edge? Late in the afternoon of the last Friday in May, as the temperature soared over 100F (38C), the Democratic nominee for Senate in Texas was going door to door. There were not many doors to knock on: Mentone, in Loving county in the far west of the state, is home to perhaps two dozen people. But Beto O’Rourke had come as part of a pledge to visit all 254 counties, in his bid to unseat the Republican Ted Cruz.Unanimously, political analysts say the 45-year-old is a long-shot to reach the Senate. Cruz is a conservative leader who finished second to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential primary. Texas hasn’t sent a Democrat to the Senate since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988, when O’Rourke was in high school. The party hasn’t won a statewide race since 1994. Some recent polls have given O’Rourke hope, showing Cruz with a single-digit lead in a state where Republicans have grown accustomed to wins of 15 points or more. However, a Quinnipiac Poll released on Wednesday showed Cruz 11 points ahead. In Mentone, O’Rourke got no answer at his first stop. But Stan Moore, a genial 70-year-old, invited O’Rourke inside a modest home he shares with his wife Ray, a Loving county native.“Well, I want to say something first,” Moore said with a smile. “I’m a Republican.” “That’s OK, there’s no obligation to vote for us,” said O’Rourke, a congressman from El Paso. What followed was an idealized – and nearly extinct – version of American politics. Candidate and voter had a respectful conversation about issues both global and hyper-local.They discussed the energy boom, which has swelled Loving county’s population from 82 in the 2010 census to an estimated 139 in 2017. (The county covers 677 sq miles, slightly larger than London.)When O’Rourke asked about national issues that concern him, Moore said: “Well, you know, the immigration thing is an issue. I wish something could be done to make things safer and let people who are good people come over, you know. And I know that’s a hard issue.”Candidate and voter spent five minutes talking about the US-Mexico border and how to get things done. O’Rourke is a fierce critic of Trump’s border and immigration policies Moore agrees with the president that more needs to be done to secure the border. But voices were never raised and both men smiled throughout.As the candidate prepared to leave, Moore talked about media coverage he had seen of a recent town hall meeting in Amarillo. “When I saw you on TV the other day,” he said, “to be honest with you, I was very impressed with you. As soon as I saw you and heard you speak on TV, I thought, ‘Man, that guy’s a sharp guy.’”Moore and O’Rourke shook hands and parted. No commitment for a vote was asked for or given. The candidate spent another 30 minutes in Mentone, talking with the owners of a food truck and convenience store who are doing pretty good business serving the men who work in the energy fields. Then O’Rourke drove off, headed for a rare weekend with his wife Amy and their three children.O’Rourke is running a campaign that is part 21st-century and part 19th. He has perhaps the most sophisticated digital political operation of the 2018 midterms, which has helped him raise a surprising $13m so far. He’s also running a retail campaign in a state with 28 million people and almost 270,000 square miles. As part of his pledge to visit every county, he has held hundreds of town hall meetings.Before coming to Loving county, O’Rourke held town halls for about 30 people in Hudspeth county and about 50 in Culberson. The stops were numbers 251, 252 and 253. Between them, the three counties cover an area larger than Wales but hold fewer than 6,000 people. Loving county is Texas’ least populated county and has the second-fewest residents of any in the US, ahead of only Kalawao county in Hawaii.O’Rourke will complete his 254-county tour on 9 June, with a visit to Cooke county in the north of the state.Loving is the extreme example of the challenges of old-style campaigning in Texas. Locals tell of Cruz’s campaign effort ahead of the Republican primary in March, which he won easily. His campaign RV rolled into Mentone and parked outside the courthouse. A couple of aides popped out, snapped a picture, jumped back in and rumbled away.Loving residents, of whom 106 are currently registered to vote, cast four ballots for Hillary Clinton in 2016 – her lowest vote total in any US county. On his visit, O’Rourke spoke to two, maybe three voters and spent eight hours on the road. But it was not an entirely quixotic quest – as he traveled across west Texas, he conducted multiple Facebook Live streams, each drawing thousands of viewers. O’Rourke said his pledge to visit all 254 counties is no gimmick, though he has also acknowledged that he will spend the final six months of the campaign focusing on the most populous areas. He said that coming from El Paso, on the far western edge of the state and in a different time zone than the rest of Texas, makes him appreciate towns and cities that often are ignored by politicians. “It’s the only way I can think of to get to know the people you want to represent and understand what’s most exciting to them and what they’re most concerned about,” he said.“Last time,” he said, “Sunday night a month ago, six weeks ago, a thousand people came out to that town hall … it works but as you can see, it’s time intensive, travel intensive. But it is worth it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c947c5ef54aff873e412ab713253b9c763c5b8/0_167_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103a6401acf4e68e83b500caa0fb622c","title":"north koreas top three military officials sacked as nuclear summit nears","story":"US officials believe there was dissent over Kim Jong-un’s approach to foreign diplomacyNorth Korea’s top three military officials have been removed from their posts, a senior US official said on Sunday, a shakeup that could signal the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is working to silence dissent ahead of a summit with Donald Trump in Singapore next week. The US official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, was commenting on a report by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency that all three of the North’s top military officials were believed to have been replaced. Trump on Friday revived the proposed 12 June summit after cancelling it a week earlier. The US is seeking a negotiated end to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. US officials believe there was some dissent in the military about Kim’s approaches to South Korea and the US. Kim likely wants to ensure any deal struck in his meeting with Trump will not face opposition at home. Since coming to power in 2011, Kim has conducted several purges in an effort to consolidate power. The young leader was just 27 years old when he took power in a society that reveres older cadres. Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who focused on North Korea policy, said Kim might be using the upcoming summit “as leverage to get rid of internal hardliners”. It was also possible the “summit created such a risk to his internal power he felt he had to protect himself by moving people around”.“It’s worth considering whether this round of summit diplomacy has given Kim Jong-un an opportunity to get a more favourable group of people at the top,” Oba said.Kim had his uncle and potential rival for control, Jang Song-thaek, tried and executed in 2013. Kim’s older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated last year in an operation widely believed to have been directed from Pyongyang. The US official did not identify the three military officials. Yonhap identified them as defence chief Pak Yong-sik chief of the Korean People’s Army’s (KPA) general staff, Ri Myong-su and Kim Jong-gak, the director of the KPA’s General Political Bureau. Trump wants North Korea to “denuclearise,” meaning to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival. Citing an unnamed intelligence official, Yonhap said No Kwang-chol, first vice minister of the Ministry of People’s armed forces, had replaced Pak Yong-sik, while Ri Myong-su was replaced by his deputy, Ri Yong-gil. It said army general Kim Su-gil’s replacement of Kim Jong-gak was confirmed in a North Korean state media report last month. The White House, State Department, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for official comment. Lower-level US-North Korean talks to prepare for the summit are continuing but have made only “halting progress,” according to a second US official briefed on the discussions. That official said US negotiators’ efforts to press for definitions of immediate, comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea had run into opposition from the White House. In a remarkable shift in tone eight days after cancelling the summit, citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility,” Trump welcomed North Korea’s former intelligence chief Kim Yong-chol to the White House on Friday, afterward exchanging smiles and handshakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2c1bf8bc510f7a89767644609c6c5abf716111/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c255d3a7c592e951c4ff98e384a218","title":"guatemalas fuego volcano erupts in pictures","story":"At least 25 people have been killed and nearly 300 injured in the most violent eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano in more than 40 years, officials said.

In return, then minister for health Mary Harney offered them salaries of between €170,000 and €240,000, with increases to bring the rate up to these levels to be paid on a phased basis.The first payment was made, but not the second phase, following the collapse in the public finances, and the State later cut consultants’ pay by 15-25 per cent.The affidavits on behalf of the State say the “economic, fiscal and banking” circumstances at the time were of “unparalleled severity”.They also argue that the government of the day “made clear” in April 2009, including with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, that some pay increases “would not be sanctioned andor approved due to the serious disturbance in the economy and a decline in the economic circumstances of the State that had occurred”.“In circumstances where there are approximately 700 other plaintiffs seeking identical relief to the plaintiff and a further 2,280 consultants on the 2008 contract, if the relief sought is granted the liability accruing is wholly beyond the means and normal budgetary management.“In the circumstances it would be contrary to public policy, to the administration of justice and to principles of good administration” if claimants were allowed pursue their cases “outside the time limits provided for judicial review”.The doctors are understood to argue they signed up to and operated the contract with the legitimate expectation its terms would be fulfilled. Other arguments understood to have been put forward by the consultants include an increase in the number of hours worked per week and how working arrangements, including in private practice, were affected. Mr Donohoe has previously said the Government would “vigorously defend” any legal actions by consultants.Mr Donohoe has declined to say how much the potential costs to the exchequer of settling or losing cases against a large number of consultants would be.

It is now well beyond that figure. The HSE has told the department that overspending is a result of the January trolley crisis and additional pressure on hospitals, especially from older patients.Paying out several hundred million euro out of the existing health budget would mean drastic and politically impossible cuts in services, so the Government would have to find additional resources, potentially upsetting Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe’s budget plans. The Dáil’s consent would be needed for any extra resources to pay consultants. While a settlement of the case could reduce the feared €700 million cost of the consultants’ court case, it is still likely to cost hundreds of millions of euro. Health budgets are a headache for any government and extra resources have been needed every year to cover the cost of overspending. Health authorities argue that the budgets are required to pay for the demand for health services, but the Department of Public Expenditure has been critical that promised savings have not been achieved in the system.A value-improvement programme which was put in place in the official health budget for the year has not delivered the level of cost savings envisaged.Government officials tend to view the HSE as a having an endless requirement for extra cash, complaining that no matter how much extra money is provided, health always comes back looking for more by the end of the year. Pressures for extra resources are evident across the health system. The HSE received a record €14.5billion from the Exchequer this year, an increase of about €600 million over last year, but even before the start of the year it warned Minister for Health Simon Harris privately that the requirements for extra funding could ultimately reach over €800 million for the full year. Documents obtained by The  earlier this year showed the HSE initially sought €1.481 billion in additional funding to maintain current service levels in 2018.The budget pressures come at a time when the Government is being pressed to publish its plan to implement the Slaintecare report, published a year ago after months of deliberation by a cross-party committee of TDs and passed unanimously by the Dáil.However, the report recommends a substantial increase in funding for the health service on an annual basis, as well as a €3 billion transformation fund to cover the costs of moving from a mix of public and privately provided healthcare to a public-only system.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3518433.1528056058!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government planning for worst case scenario on extradition with uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere could be a “very significant” deterioration of co-operation between Dublin and London, causing “immediate and serious problems” in dealing with criminals and terrorists. Photograph: iStockThe Government is preparing for a “worst-case scenario” of extradition arrangements with Britain breaking down entirely after its planned pull-out of the EU in less than a year’s time.And it fears a “very significant” deterioration of co-operation between Dublin and London, causing “immediate and serious problems” in dealing with criminals and terrorists if the UK also exits a handful of key EU-wide conventions.Under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system, police in any EU country can ask its counterparts in another member state to arrest a criminal suspect and return them for prosecution.The process takes as little as 48 days to complete at present.Documents from the Department of Justice show assistant secretary James Martin, head of international policy, briefed staff that the “best-case scenario” for extradition post-Brexit is the transfer of accused criminals taking “four or five years”.“Worst-case scenario is that extradition breaks down,” Mr Martin told his international policy unit, records released under Freedom of Information show.“This is not an understatement. Before the EAW, there were a whole series of cases where people were not extradited to the UK because it was regarded as political or courts said a person would not get a fair trial.“There was practically no extradition between Spain and the UK.”Last week, a senior EU figure told journalists during a briefing in Brussels that Britain would not legally be able to continue in the EAW system after it leaves the bloc.Several appeals are already before the courts in both the UK and Ireland challenging extradition on the basis of Brexit.In a separate discussion on the matter, Mr Martin told criminal justice figures last October that the UK’s decision to exit the EU had “alarmed” his department.Notably, the UK’s insistence on ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will “pose serious and complex obstacles” to close co-operation between the two countries, he said.It could take between “10 to 15 years before new agreements enter into force”, he told a private meeting of the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, his speaking notes show.The figure is based on the length of time it took for Norway and Iceland to negotiate a “surrender agreement” with the EU, which remains subject to a political clause.The “fall-back situation is the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition,” which “has many flaws”, he said.In a heavily redacted release of the department’s official assessment of the impact of Brexit, it says there will be a “noticeable practical effect” on Ireland through more than 700 EU regulations, directives and other instruments .Some 86 were identified as needing immediate attention, but a handful – including the EAW, Mutual Legal Assistance, Europol and the Prum convention on cross-border co-operation on crime and terrorism – are deemed among the most important.“If the UK was to exit all these instruments, the level of criminal justice and police co-operation between Ireland and the UK would be adversely affected to a very significant degree for both ordinary crime and terrorism,” it states.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has voted No to tribalism and fear in overwhelming decision to remove the Eighth   May 27, 2018Thirty-five years after its introduction, Eighth Amendment repealed after bitter campaign   May 28, 2018Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fight   June 1, 2018The victory belongs to everyone but any analysis that does not place at its centre the feminist, women-led movement is bereft "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyNetanyahu on European tour to convince leaders to back out of Iran deal Rwanda pharmacies offer \u0026#39do-it-yourself\u0026#39 HIV kits to allow virus testing in privacy of your homeGuatemala\u0026#39s Fuego volcano eruption: At least 25 dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through villagesPhilippines president Rodrigo Duterte sparks outrage by kissing woman on stage in South KoreaA Very English Scandal, episode 3, review: Hugh Grant completes transformation from romantic lead to hypocritical rotter in finale of the Jeremy Thorpe affairBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2018, the final: Lost Voice Guy a worthy winner as Rev Michael Curry gives his blessingLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestants as it starts on ITVItalians fall out of love with the EU - but will they ever leave?Crafty crayfish saves itself from boiling pot in China by pulling off its own clawEU will \u0026#39dig its own grave\u0026#39 if it tries to punish Italy, warns George SorosGrenfell Tower Inquiry: Fire service\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 strategy failed as experts list catastrophic safety breachesKremlin invites North Korea\u0026#39s Kim Jong-un to RussiaTrain chaos as dozens cancelled on day one of Northern Rail emergency timetable Trashy escapism from a more innocent time: why Celebrity Love Island is still the original and bestGroup of male Japanese politicians join forces to allow babies to cry in publicMan leaps from runaway car at Dracula\u0026#39s castle Lazy cooks who use ready-made sauces are more likely to get cancer Is Kim Jong-un replacing top military leaders to fend off coup ahead of Trump summit?MSPs call for child \u0026#39welfare assessment\u0026#39 of all armed forces visits to Scottish schoolsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000165077317_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDGzgDyQhQusxl972-IFqFf3QPlw6VMeYi4WZ_5hcM10.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"kremlin invites north koreas kim jong un russia","story":"Kim Jong-un met Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, last weekRussia has invited Kim Jong-un to visit the country, becoming the latest major power to seek an audience with the reclusive North Korean leader, the Kremlin confirmed on Monday. Kim may visit the country during an economic forum held in the far eastern city of Vlaostok in September, said Mr Peskov, a spokesman, adding that “the details and time will be further coordinated through diplomatic channels.”The invitation to visit was initially floated by Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, who visited Pyongyang last week for the first time since 2009. “Come to Russia. We would be very happy to see you,” Mr Lavrov told Kim on televised footage. After being viewed for years as the isolated dictator of a pariah regime, Kim’s standing as an international statesman has soared this year after he initiated a diplomatic détente with South Korea in January and allowed athletes from the North to attend the Winter Olympics. In just over a week he will meet with Donald Trump for a summit in Singapore, marking a political coup as the first North Korean leader ever to meet with a sitting US president. Vladimir Putin met with former North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il during in Vlaostok in 2002The invitation, and the visit of Mr Lavrov to Pyongyang, reflect the wariness of both Moscow and Beijing of American influence in East Asia, and a push by both capitals to make their own imprint on talks about the Korean peninsula’s peace process. Mr Lavrov, who passed on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “warmest regards and best wishes” to Kim, is believed to have conveyed Moscow’s concerns about developments in the region, and also support for the declaration between North and South Korea to work towards denuclearisation of the peninsula.He said Russia hoped all sides would take a cautious approach and not try to rush the process. He also indicated that Moscow believes sanctions can be eased in the meantime. While Russia has welcomed the upcoming talks between Kim and Mr Trump, it has urged the leaders not to create unrealistic demands. “We are calling on (the US and North Korea) to refrain from inflated expectations, and ask them not to knowingly advance unfeasible demands that may derail the process of negotiations, Artyom Kozhin, deputy director of the Russian foreign ministry’s press department said on Friday, reported TASS. Kim, meanwhile, appears keen to keep Moscow on side, reportedly complaining to Mr Lavrov about “US hegemonism” and revealing that he hoped to boost cooperation between the two countries. “As we move to adjust to the political situation in the face of US hegemonism, I am willing to exchange detailed and in-depth opinions with your leadership and hope to do so moving forward,” Kim told Mr Lavrov. Please review our commenting policyKirstie Allsopp defends flying business class while leaving her children in economy Netanyahu on European tour to convince leaders to back out of Iran deal Rwanda pharmacies offer \u0026#39do-it-yourself\u0026#39 HIV kits to allow virus testing in privacy of your homeGuatemala\u0026#39s Fuego volcano eruption: At least 25 dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through villagesPhilippines president Rodrigo Duterte sparks outrage by kissing woman on stage in South KoreaA Very English Scandal, episode 3, review: Hugh Grant completes transformation from romantic lead to hypocritical rotter in finale of the Jeremy Thorpe affairBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2018, the final: Lost Voice Guy a worthy winner as Rev Michael Curry gives his blessingLove Island 2018: A beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new series and contestants as it starts on ITVItalians fall out of love with the EU - but will they ever leave?Crafty crayfish saves itself from boiling pot in China by pulling off its own clawEU will \u0026#39dig its own grave\u0026#39 if it tries to punish Italy, warns George SorosGrenfell Tower Inquiry: Fire service\u0026#39s \u0026#39stay put\u0026#39 strategy failed as experts list catastrophic safety breachesTrain chaos as dozens cancelled on day one of Northern Rail emergency timetable Trashy escapism from a more innocent time: why Celebrity Love Island is still the original and bestGroup of male Japanese politicians join forces to allow babies to cry in publicMan leaps from runaway car at Dracula\u0026#39s castle Lazy cooks who use ready-made sauces are more likely to get cancer Is Kim Jong-un replacing top military leaders to fend off coup ahead of Trump summit?MSPs call for child \u0026#39welfare assessment\u0026#39 of all armed forces visits to Scottish schoolsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000165354424_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDvK05s05CrAtTEKxlYt6SZ3G-oMqd7JJS4_RoPtsL1M.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"man leaps runaway car draculas castle","story":"Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire is the castle thought to have inspired Bram Stoker\u0026#39s DraculaA man has been taken to hospital after jumping from his car just before it rolled down an embankment towards a cliff edge.The vehicle came to a stop at a boulder which prevented it from plummeting down the cliff face at Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire, the castle thought to have inspired Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula.Emergency services were called to the scene at about 4.15pm on Sunday.The man jumped out before the car rolled away.

It’s a shame we can’t be more grown up about it, we aren’t asking for ra-ra skirts or skinny jeans, just grey tailored shorts for two months a year, it’s not a big deal.”Some other\u0026nbspparents also criticised the\u0026nbspnew uniform, which also introduced blazers, as they did not\u0026nbspfeel the clothing was appropriate for warmer months.\u0026nbspWith temperatures set to reach 26C this week, parents were keen for their kids to feel comfortable in the heat.\u0026nbspThe stricter clothing policy was one of the changes brought in since the school was placed in special measures, after receiving an ‘inadequate’ rating by Oftsed inspectors in spring last year.But the school appears to be making progress and the latest Ofsted monitoring inspection from November 2017, said: “Pupils value their new uniform, and they are smart and polite and most conduct themselves well.”\u0026nbspHeadteacher Moira Green, who also introduced longer teaching hours since taking on the role, was credited with helping to turn the school around.\u0026nbspThe school did not respond to The Independent\u0027s request for comment, but Ms Green told the Daily Mail: In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success.”The school - which was previously threatened with closure but has since been saved - will be turned into an academy and become part of the Maiden Erlegh Trust in August.Ms Green added: Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge\u0027s adoption of a more formal uniform.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it.\u0026nbspEven Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Fashion is, of course, a highly sensitive area for cultural appropriation. The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.And I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War\u0026nbsp(though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Humans themselves even interbred with Neanderthals at some point in history, with many modern humans still carrying traces of\u0026nbspNeanderthal\u0026nbspDNA\u0026nbspin their genes.This new discovery is significant as it means there is yet another member of the great ape family with whom humans might share a common ancestor.Unfortunately the DNA fragments discovered within the bonobo only amount to roughly 3 per cent of the extinct ape\u0027s genome, making learning specifics about the new species\u0026nbspdifficult.Finding physical remains\u0026nbspis also unlikely because of the length of time involved, with Mr\u0026nbspKuhlwilm\u0026nbsprating the odds of finding an intact sample\u0026nbsplow.The ghost chimps\u0026nbspwould have died out long before Homo sapiens came on the scene around 300,000 years ago.Changes in environment have often forced\u0026nbspdifferent species to interbreed.Scientists have started witnessing\u0026nbspgrizzly bears and polar bears create offspring as climate change forces their natural environments closer to one another.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since 1816 they have been housed in the British Museum.Their status has long been hotly disputed. Greece, which for decades has called for their return, with several formal requests, has also in the past threatened legal action and proposed solutions such as mediation by Unesco.Lord Elgin insisted he had permission to take the sculptures, saying he had the permission of officials of the ruling Ottoman empire, and that he was worried about their being damaged.Opponents of their removal from London say that the move would pave the way for requests from other countries for artworks in British museums to returned.Supporters of the Greek position argue that the Ottoman authorities were a foreign force and had no right to let the artefacts go.Ta Nea reported: “In the exclusive interview given to Nea, Jeremy Corbyn agrees that, if elected, he will begin the return of the Parthenon sculptures to our country.”Mr Corbyn reportedly said: “They were made in Greece and have been there for many centuries until Lord Elgin took them.“As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures.”Mr Corbyn has long been a supporter of the marbles’ repatriation but this is the first time as party leader that he has made his intent so clear.The UK government’s position is that the ownership of the sculptures is a matter for the trustees of the British Museum, according to a House of Commons briefing paper.The British Museum website says: “The Acropolis Museum allows the Parthenon sculptures that are in Athens to be appreciated against the backdrop of ancient Greek and Athenian history. This display does not alter the trustees’ view that the sculptures are part of everyone’s shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries. The trustees remain convinced that the current ision allows different and complementary stories to be told about the surviving sculptures.”It says the British Museum Act 1963 bans the trustees from permanently disposing of objects unless they are duplicates of others already in the collection or are “unfit to be retained ... and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students”.A Labour spokesperson said Mr Corbyn was stating his long-standing personal view and that he was right to call for constructive talks.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Instead of saying you can’t, just learn how to use an espresso machine.”Mr Campbell said he was “very impractical,”\u0026nbspadding: “Anything else you want to tell your dad off for?”His daughter ended by telling him he needed to feel more comfortable talking about periods.She said: “If you really want to be a feminist you need to be able to talk about periods, periods are a natural thing.“If I tell you I’m going to change my tampon you grimace and cover your ears.“Being able to talk about periods like they’re a normal thing that happen to women, they’re not disgusting, this is a big thing for the whole period conversation. We need to break down that taboo and make them normal things.”She concluded: “You’ve got to educate yourself on things, it’s work, you’ve got to really do that if you really want to properly be a feminist. You’ve got to educate yourself and talk to women properly.”Mr Campbell ended the call by attempting a joke about his daughter’s lack of football knowledge, which fell flat.He said: “I now want to educate you in football, you couldn’t even name three current Burnley players could you?”Grace responded saying she didn’t see what political point he was making,\u0026nbspbefore Mr Campbell closed the call by saying: “Alright Grace, okay, stop nagging me.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The approach on services therefore should be about managing ergence.”Ministers are under pressure to come up with some commonly agreed proposals that are acceptable to Brussels by the European Council summit meeting towards the end of the month.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In most circumstances, if\u0026nbspone dies, quits or\u0026nbspretires then the successor is voted for by members of their own party.Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) found that the average electorate for normal hereditary by-election\u0026nbspis only 32 voters, with only 29 people usually turning out.The group\u0026nbspfound that four by-elections had more candidates than electors in recent years – including a by-election for Labour hereditary peers with\u0026nbsp11 candidates and only three voters.Some 3,190 votes have been cast in the last 32 by-elections, which began in 2003, compared to the last 32 Commons by-elections, where 931,725 votes have been cast.ERS chief executive\u0026nbspDarren Hughes\u0026nbspsaid: “These so-called by-elections are an undemocratic farce – and make mockery of our democracy.“This time, around 25 peers are set to decide which aristocrat remains in parliament to vote on our laws, for the rest of their lives. “That is not democracy – and it’s time we ended this bizarre hangover from feudal times. \u0026nbsp“It’s vital for trust and faith in our democracy that the forthcoming farce of a by-election – brought about by the retirement of Earl Baldwin of Bewdley – will be the last. “The public should decide who votes on our laws – not a tiny clique of aristocrats.”Labour peer Lord Grocott\u0026nbspis trying to axe the by-elections through a private members’ bill but his efforts were blocked by a handful of hereditary peers in March.However,\u0026nbspConservative frontbencher Lord Young of Cookham\u0026nbspsaid the government “will not obstruct” his bill and offered it more parliamentary time.Lord Grocott\u0026nbsptold The Independent:\u0026nbsp“These were only supposed to be a temporary measure but it’s now gone on for 19 years.“There have been 32 hereditary by-elections, so I mean that’s a third of all hereditary peers who have been replaced. It’s ridiculous.“You have this situation where the government is trying to reduce the size of the Lords and the House of Commons but you have 92 peers who cannot be touched.”Only one woman is eligible to stand in the upcoming by-election out of more than 200 candidates, and just 31 peers will be able to vote, according to a written parliamentary question to Lord Grocott.The poll will also cost taxpayers more than £1,140 to stage.Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the issue was “another reminder of how archaic, undemocratic and outdated” the Lords is.“Liberal Democrats have long argued for an elected upper chamber, but sadly attempts to introduce reform were thwarted by the self-interest of the other two parties,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Isn’t it ironic, however, that murmurs from the Tories have changed in recent weeks as a result of the Lords defeating them on the EU Withdrawal Bill on fifteen occasions?”Lord Fowler, the Lords speaker, has welcomed efforts to slash the size of the upper chamber\u0026nbspafter a key Lords committee\u0026nbsprecommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in numbers.\u0026nbspA Lords spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The House of Lords recognises the need for reform and, following a report from the Lord Speaker’s committee on the size of the house in October 2017, showed overwhelming\u0026nbspsupport for reducing and capping the size of the house, and for linking new appointments to general election results.”It comes after\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspaccused of\u0026nbsp“hypocrisy” after appointing nine new Tory peers to the House of Lords, including several ex-ministers, despite promising that senior politicians would not receive automatic ennoblement.Her announcement coincided with the eve of the royal wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, prompting claims that the prime minister had tried to\u0026nbspsneak out the news when it would receive little attention.Candidates for the upcoming by-election will be announced on 15 June, with the count on 4 July.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Certainly, opening bank accounts, and whether you can or cannot as an illegal immigrant, I’m not sure that the data that we have is accurate enough so I have suspended that for the time being.”However, he said he still wanted to maintain a distinction between welcoming people in the UK who are here legally and not tolerating illegal immigration.Mr Javid also said that overall net migration is still too high and needs to be addressed by policies to bring it down to a sustainable level.Asked if the “tens of thousands” was still a commitment he was happy with, he said: “It is a commitment in our manifesto … we are happy with our manifesto.”Earlier this week, Ms Davidson doubled down on her call for the “tens of thousands” target to be scrapped.She said in a speech: “I see neither the sense nor the need to stick to an immigration figure devised nearly a decade ago, which has never been met and does not fit the requirements of the country.“Setting an immigration target reduced to the tens of thousands is one thing when unemployment is running at 8 per cent. Refusing to review it when the country nears full employment and sectors are reporting skills shortages is quite another.”The Independent, along with the Open Britain group,\u0026nbsphas been running the Drop the Target campaign to scrap the “tens of thousands” net migration policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Labour leader has long campaigned for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece, and declared in a 2014 debate in the Houses of Parliament that the items had been \u0026ldquostolen.Speaking with the Greek newspaper Ta Nea, Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoIt is very clear to me that the Parthenon Sculptures belong to Greece.\u0026ldquoThey were made in Greece and that is where they were for thousands of years until they were taken by Lord Elgin.Pointing to the UK\u0026rsquos colonialist past, he added: \u0026ldquoAs with everything stolen or removed from a country that was in the possession or colony - including objects looted from other countries in the past - we should also begin constructive talks with the Greek government on the return of the sculptures.Jeremy Corbyn has declared he

process of returning the artefacts upon entering Downing Street.A Labour spokesman commented on Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos statements, saying: Jeremy was stating his long-standing personal view that the Parthenon statues were made in and belong to Greece.The Elgin marbles are an emotive issue and it is in the interests of both Britain and Greece to have a constructive dialogue about them, which represents all views.Jeremy was right to call for constructive talks between the UK and Greek governments.The UK Government has claimed the ownership of the sculptures is a matter for the British museumThe sculptures were removed by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon at the top of the Acropolis in Athens and brought to the UK between 1799 and 1810 after obtaining permission from the Ottoman Empire which ruled Greece at the time.The Greek government has made formal applications to the UK for the sculptures to be returned, and have argued the Ottomans had no legal right to sanction their removal.Yet numerous MPs and academics believe the acquisition of the sculptures was legal and argue they have contributed greatly to the education of the British public.A Government source slated Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos statements, saying: \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot share the anti-historic views that Mr Corbyn and others have on the left, which is that you should disavow yourself of everything that has happened in your country\u0026rsquos history, whether you were responsible for it or not.\u0026ldquoYou might as well say to any foreign country that wanted to: come and bring your removal trucks to the national museums and strip them out.The Government\u0026rsquos position on the issue was outlined in a briefing paper published in June 2017, which noted: \u0026ldquoThe Government\u0026rsquos position continues to be that \u0026lsquoissues relating to the ownership and management of the Parthenon sculptures are matters for the trustees of the British Museum\u0026rsquo.However the British Museum has indicated the return of the sculptures remains highly unlikely.They wrote: The trustees hold the whole of the British Museum collection under the terms of the British Museum Act 1963, for the benefit of the public.This legislation prohibits the trustees from permanently disposing of objects unless they are duplicates of others already in the

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

Diana once said it was where she spent the happiest time of her life.She moved into the flat almost immediately after it was given to her and furnished it in simple Habitat style. Diana lived with friends - Virginia Pitman, Caroline Pride and Ann Bolton - whom she charged £18-a-week rent.She wrote the words Chief Chick on her bedroom door so no-one would forget her landlady status, and was said to have imposed a strict cleaning rota.Diana left the flat in February 1981 and moved into Clarence House, the Queen Mothers residence on the night before her engagement to Prince Charles was officially announced.After the wedding in July, Dianas mother, Frances Shand Kydd, sold the flat to Japanese buyers for £100,000, twice as much as she originally paid for it.One royal buff told The Sun: “Letters from this period of Diana’s life are very rare.“It is written on December 28th, but we don’t know which year. It is very likely to have been 1980. The letter hints that Christmas was organised for her. She did not go to Windsor, where the royals spent Christmas, that year.

More than 1,100 people have been taken to court by local authorities for social care debt during the last two years. An investigation by GMB union for its annual congress in Brighton this week, has revealed at least 166,000 people are trapped in debt for social care. The problem is getting worse as people are living longer and their savings are no longer keeping pace with soaring care costs. Cash-strapped councils are being left to pick up the bills and sometimes have to move people with dementia and debilitating diseases to lower cost care homes. Freedom of Information requests, submitted to every local authority in Great Britain, also shows at least 1,178 people have been taken to court by local authorities for social care debts.  Out of the total of at least 166,835 people who are in arrears on their social care payments. More than 78,000 have debt management procedures started against them by their council for non-payment of social care charges. Under current rules, people with capital and savings above \u0026pound23,250 have to meet their care fees in full. Those with between \u0026pound14,250 and \u0026pound23,250 will be able get some financial aid from local authorities for care. People with less than \u0026pound14,250 will get full aid from local authorities, but any eligible income will be taken into account. Sharon Wilde, GMB national officer, said:These stark figures show the UK’s social care ticking timebomb has now blown a gaping hole in families’ finances. “The fact more than 1,000 people have been taken to court because they’re unable to pay for their own care – or that of their loved ones – shows the system just isn’t working. Our ageing population is creating a huge demand for care staff - but caring is still not seen as a sought after career. “The lack of local authority funding means low pay - and the sector is struggling to recruit and retain the dedicated staff needed to provide the best care to the UK’s most vulnerable people. “We need a clear, coherent strategy for funding social care now and in the future. Otherwise the struggle to recruit and retain carers will become even more acute, while tens of thousands of people are plunged into debt trying to pay for the level of support that they need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dr rosena allin khan emergency","story":"NewsopinionDr Rosena Allin-Khan: Emergency services do whole nation proud during atrocities such as London Bridge terror attackI know from day one what terror attacks do to the emergency services\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDr Rosena Allin-Khan20:40, 2 JUN 2018Updated13:56, 3 JUN 2018NewsopinionAn armed police officer on Borough High Street on the night of the London Bridge terrorist attack (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMy very first week as a doctor was the week of the 7/7 bombings.

We should not be surprised the Department for Brexit has game planned a no deal scenario and concluded it would be disastrous.   Anyone who has half an eye on the Brexit understood the implications of falling back on World Trade Organisation rules without resolving hundreds of issues ranging from our membership of the European medicines agency to the collection of VAT on foreign imports.   Brussels has been aware of this from the off which is why they always knew Mrs May’s ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ was posturing.   With time pressing and Cabinet differences apparently insoluble, the greater the likelihood that it will be left to Parliament to determine what sort of Brexit we have.   Having campaigned to take back control Brexiteers are in no position to complain about this.   And there was a strong argument that Mrs May should have taken a more consensual route in the first place.   But it does mean Downing Street and the Cabinet are struggling to keep control of events which adds to the uncertainty that so unnerves business.   This is a message the bosses of leading firms will convey when they meet the Prime Minister in Downing Street today.

Civil servants are reportedly preparing contingency plans for the possibility that Britain is left without food, fuel and medicines if we crash out of the EU without a deal. Whitehall officials are said to have been planning models for mild, severe and Armageddon outcomes for a no deal exit in March 2019. Asked if Mrs May was preparing for armageddon, the PM\u0027s official spokesman said: The Department for Exiting the European Union has said that these claims are completely false. A significant amount of work and decision making has gone into our no deal plans, especially in relation to ports, and we know that none of this would happen. But pressed on whether Mrs May still believed that no deal would be better than a bad deal, the PM\u0027s official spokesman said: Yes. The spokesman insisted the Government still believed it could achieve a good deal with the EU before we leave next year.  But he pointedly played down hopes that such a deal could be reached by the time of the next European Summit council. The spokesman described this month\u0027s summit in Brussels as only a staging post to the Autumm and said the Government was instead working to an agreement in October. It comes after documents reportedly drawn up by government officials suggested a no-deal Brexit could lead to fuel, food and medicine shortages within two weeks of us leaving the EU.  The ‘doomsday’ scenario was produced by civil servants for Brexit Secretary David Davis, according to the Sunday Times.  They’re understood to have imagined three scenarios for what could happen if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal - a mild one, a severe one - and one branded “armageddon.” Even the moderate case, they say, would see the port of Dover collapse on day one.

The witness, who did not want to be named, said that the pooch could be heard crying and howling as the mercury rose on Sunday afternoon. The customer was concerned enough to start taking pictures and even timed how long it took for the dog\u0027s owner to return to his distressed pet.  In total, 20 minutes passed before the dog was released from the hot vehicle, Somerset Live reported.  I could hear the dog crying and howling and I could see the window was only cracked open a little bit, the onlooker said.  I timed how long the dog was in the car for and it was 20 minutes until the owner came to the car to let the dog out. It\u0027s thought an announcement was made over the tannoy at the Sainsbury\u0027s store in Sherborne, Dorset, to call for the dog to be let out at around 3pm. The RSPCA has repeatedly warned of the dangers of shutting dogs in hot cars in recent years - even if it\u0027s only for a few minutes. A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: “It’s important to remember not to leave any animal in a car or caravan, or in a conservatory or outbuilding, where temperatures can quickly rise, even when it doesn’t feel that warm outside.

Nicholas Mitchell, a software developer, decided to put his IT skills to good use when he was constantly late due to delays or cancellations and was blocked by the company when he complained online. The app,– wryly named Northern Fail – records every time a train is delayed or cancelled, acting as a historical database so people can look back and monitor the operator’s performance. Nicholas set up the app week before the now-infamous timetable changes took place across the country, when he was already struggling to get to work on time due to disruption.  He gets the train every day from his home in Urmston, Greater Manchester to his work in Ancoats, reports the Manchester Evening News .   He said: “I just sat back and thought ‘I’m getting ignored, I’m being blocked’. “I thought to myself, ‘how can I use the skills I have in my job as a software developer?’ And that’s when i thought about setting up the app. “Things were already bad before the timetable, and they’ve just got even worse since. I didn’t even know there was going to be a timetable change at the time.” The app simply works by collating data every time a full or a part cancellation is announced on the Northern Rail website. Nicholas, who works at Shaping Cloud in Ancoats, said 5,000 people have already downloaded Northern Fail, and the reaction has been really positive online.  He said: “I’ve had some really good feedback from people saying technology is political. They say there’s nothing else like it. The Northern website only records live cancellations, so it’s really useful. I’ve had messages from Andy Burnham thanking me. When I first saw the data on the app, I thought it must be broken when I saw how many cancellations there were. “It’s got even worse since the timetable change. I’ve been getting some messages saying some last minute cancellations aren’t even being recorded on the app, so the figures could actually be a lot worse.” Issues following the timetable change, on Sunday, May 20, have meant that he struggles to get home from work, and has resorted to getting the bus. On Thursday, four consecutive trains from Oxford Road to Urmston were cancelled, meaning he would have had no chance of getting back home within a reasonable hour.

Nathan Rees posted a Tweet to easyJet on Friday night after the airline was forced to cancel a flight to Prague, saying he would be taking legal action against them. More than 140 people were left disappointed after the flight from Bristol Airport to the Czech capital was cancelled after a group of revellers treated the plane like a nightclub, reports BristolLive . But Nathan slammed easyJet for destroying his stag do, and said that the head of their cabin crew should be sacked. Landscape worker Nathan, from Cardiff posted on Twitter on Friday night: @easyJet your cabin crew and head cabin lady need to be sacked.  Were you on the flight? Email webnews@trinitymirror   Made a mountain out of a mole hill on the flight to Prague yesterday evening that got cancelled. Destroyed my stag and also hundred of others trip to Prague. Legal action is been taken. Joke. And he went on to respond to other passengers who had Tweeted about the incident - telling one man to get off your high horse and wind your neck in. Writing to private pilot Joe Roberts, Nathan said: No one was shouting and swearing you tool of a guy. Wind your neck in. Got no time for your opinions. If you honestly can say we deserved to get thrown off that plane well so be it. We have a number of people who are going to stand in our corner for this. One member of staff was on a power trip and caused this. A number of people took our side on this and have made a formal complaint about the staff of EasyJet. Mate get off your high horse, can\u0027t be dealing with you this morning.  Nathan also responded to a Tweet from PhD student Richard Bellis, who was a passenger on the cancelled flight. Richard wrote: Absolute nightmare start to my weekend sampling beers in Prague as my @easyJet plane hasn\u0027t moved for 2 hours.

On Saturday, Nathan\u0027s friend Ben Grzesica, 31, wrote on Facebook: Well we finally got here, let\u0027s get this stag trip underway #take2. Nathan is set to marry long-term girlfriend Stephanie Lewis, 31, from Treharris in Wales. There has been confusion as to why the flight actually had to be cancelled. Bristol Live report that it wasn\u0027t just the rowdy behaviour of a minority which led to the flight\u0027s cancellation.  While police and easyJet staff were delayed dealing with the disruption, the weather forecast developed. EasyJet released an initial statement about the incident which the company then updated late on Saturday evening. In the update a spokeswoman explained that it was the bad weather which ultimately led to the flight being cancelled - and around 140 people having to get off the plane before it had moved at Bristol Airport. However, it\u0027s thought that if there hadn\u0027t been bad behaviour, the flight might have been able to take off safely before the weather became an issue. An EasyJet spokesman said: EasyJet was required to cancel flight EZY6267 from Bristol to Prague on June 1 due to a group of passengers behaving disruptively on board which caused a delay - the flight was further delayed and then cancelled due to adverse weather conditions. She went on to apologise for the effects on passengers and said it had done what it could to help those affected. The spokeswoman added: “EasyJet’s crew did everything possible to minimise the disruption for our remaining passengers who have been given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or receiving a refund.  EasyJet also provided hotel accommodation and meals for those passengers who required them. “Our crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. “Whilst such incidents are rare, we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour on board and always push for prosecution. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet\u0027s highest priority.” A police officer, Nick Falconer, took to Twitter to share pictures of the police operation.

The national hardware store gave the job to Afsor Ali, 31, after he changed his name - by reversing his surname and forename - to hide his past. He spent more than a year at the chain until his extremist past was exposed when he was charged with assault after attacking a customer at the store in a row over a plastic bag. On the day of the attack, Ali, who has now been sacked, was due a promotion to supervisor at the shop in Leyton, east London.  Ali, of Bethnal Green, east London, was jailed for 31 months at the Old Bailey in 2014, but was released just 11 months later. In 2011 he got three convictions for assaulting a police officer and was given a conditional discharge. The former Transport For London worker was first arrested in December 2011 when he took part in a protest outside the US Embassy against drone attacks in Pakistan alongside members of the banned group Muslims Against Crusades. He was released without charge but during the investigation an MP3 player was seized and a laptop and hard drive taken from his home.  It was discovered that Ali kept terror manuals on his MP3 player and owned a copy of the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire with a guide to making bombs and firing an AK-47. Under the alias Asad Ullah, he promoted extremism in YouTube videos, saying the 9/11 terrorist atrocity was an historic event and also claimed there would be a terrorist attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding in 2011. He also admitted possessing a stolen passport after he tried to flee on the Eurostar to Paris in March 2014 but was spotted by French officials. The jury at the Old Bailey in 2014 was also told that in addition to false ID documents, Ali had two recordings of phone calls between him and the radical Islamist Shaykh Omar Bakri Mohammed. Mohammed, dubbed the Tottenham Ayatollah, fled to the Lebanon after his group Al-Muhajiroun was banned. It was then taken over by radical preacher Anjem Choudary.  Ali was given a 16-month jail sentence for the passport offence and an eight-month term for skipping bail, to run concurrently, as well as a further 15 months for having terrorist material. After being jailed for 31 months he was seen walking free in the streets just 11 months later in August 2015. In the latest case, Stratford Magistrates heard that Ali flew into a rage after a customer asked him for larger bags. Working behind the till, he was serving Harry Flanagan and his mum Michelle at the DIY store on February 16 when they asked for a larger bag. Ali told them he did not have any and to then get your own bag. A manager at the east London shop came to calm the situation and told Ali to leave the till.  As the defendant walked past the victim he grabbed him by the neck and pushed him against the counter before security separated them. Wearing a brown hoodie and beige chinos, he appeared on one count of assault which he initially denied but then admitted as his trial was due to start. Ghulam Humayun, prosecuting, said: Police were called to a B\u0026ampQ in Leyton Mills retail park in relation to an allegation of assault. The altercation was between a member of he public, Harry Flanagan and a member of staff, who was the defendant. The victim approached the defendant at his till point and asked him for a larger bag, at which point he was told there was no larger bags available. The victim stated to the defendant he had an attitude. The defendant then said to get his own bag. The victim asked the defendant if he would get the manager as he was uncooperative towards the victim.  The manager then informed the victim there were no bags available. The victim asked the defendant to leave as he was being abrupt towards him, to which the manager also asked him to leave. The defendant then walked around the till point and approached the complainant, pushed him up against a plastic barrier then grabbed him by the neck. Security staff had to intervene to break up the incident. CCTV shown to the court showed Harry and his mother Michelle buying goods at the till before getting into a verbal altercation with Ali. He is then seen coming round and pushing the victim into the till before an eight-person scuffle breaks out. Costa Cantaris, defending, said Ali, who had been working at the store for a year, was due for a promotion the day of the assault but had now lost his job as a result of the incident. He told the court: He was due for a promotion that day so it was unfortunate he has now lost his job as he was well-liked by staff and never had a complaint from a customer.

Now aged 36, she has thousands of social media followers and has had to fight off floods of marriage proposals from across the globe.

She told the Daily Star at the time: I\u0027ve had lots of messages from admirers. Most of them asking for dates or sex.  I\u0027ve even had some people asking to marry me.

Chiltern Edge Secondary School in Oxfordshire has banned shorts from the uniform, insisting boys who are too hot in trousers should wear a skirt instead. The policy change comes as more schools across the country begin adopting more \u0027gender-neutral\u0027 approach to governing. A parent of a pupil at Chiltern Edge, Alastair Vince-Porteous, claimed he contacted the school to ask if his son could wear shorts, before being told his options were either full-length trousers or a skirt. Mr Vince-Porteous said: I was told shorts are not part of the uniform. It\u0027s a shame we can\u0027t be more grown up about it. We aren\u0027t asking for a rara skirt or skinny jeans, just tailored shorts for two months a year. It\u0027s not a big deal.   Another parent, Joanne Muday, said: It\u0027s nuts to make kids wear blazers and ties when it gets very hot., reports the Mail Online .  In August, Chiltern Edge Secondary School will become an Academy, meaning it can be governed more independently although remain state-funded. Their uniform policy change comes after the school was branded inadequate by Ofsted. Headteacher Moira Green said: In September 2017, with the support of parents, Chiltern Edge made the decision to move to a more formal uniform. This has been a success. Maiden Erlegh Trust, in preparation for September 2018, wholeheartedly support Chiltern Edge’s adoption of a more formal uniform. The Oxfordshire school is far from the first to introduce similar uniform rules.

Ayman Faisal managed to open a bottle taken from a bottom shelf while his mum Saira\u0027s back was turned and ingest a substance containing caustic soda. The boy, who was aged two at the time, has been left unable to speak and has to be fed through a tube in his stomach. Ayman\u0027s family launched legal action, and a judge has found that shopkeeper Safiqit Younis is one-third responsible for his horrific injuries, the Manchester Evening News reports.  The youngster, now aged seven, was left fighting for his life following the incident at Younis\u0027 Safa Superstore in Moss Side, Manchester, in January 2013. Following an investigation, manufacturer Active Brands Concept Ltd admitted it was liable because the child-resistant cap was easily removed by the toddler, court documents said. Senior judges have now ruled that Safa Superstore is one-third responsible because the bottle should have been stored on a higher shelf. In addition, the owner did not have the correct licence to sell the toxic substance - which was marked ‘keep out of reach of children\u0027.  Ayman’s mum Saira, 38, also suffered chemical burns to her hands and feet as she desperately tried to help her son. Both have claimed compensation. The little boy was strapped into his pushchair when the incident happened. Reaching to get something, Saira turned away for just a few seconds - when she turned back she saw Ayman’s lips had gone purple and blue and there was blood coming out of his mouth. Describing the horrifying moment she said: “I didn’t know what it was or what had happened at first, I just knew it was something bad. “I remember screaming at the staff to phone an ambulance while I tried to get as much as I could out with my hands. I was terrified. All I kept thinking was ‘please don’t let me lose my son’.” Ayman spent around a month in intensive care and a further six weeks on a general ward at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital before being allowed home.  Four years later he still needs round-the-clock care to manage his tracheostomy. He attends the Lancasterian School in Didsbury and is learning to communicate using his iPad and sign language. Saira, from Rusholme, said she is incredibly proud of how her son has managed his life-changing injuries. “It has been a struggle and I’ve had my moments, but when it comes to Ayman I just have to carry on,” she said. “I am so proud of him for what he has been through and I try to stay positive and make sure he does too. “He does ask questions like when his tracheostomy is going to come out and I do try to be honest with him. That’s when it upsets me and I don’t think that will ever go away.” Manufacturer Active Brands Concept Ltd admitted liability after Saira’s lawyers, Slater and Gordon launched legal action. They will now have to pay two-thirds of the damages. Judge Craig Sephton QC initially found Mr Younis partly to blame last July. The case went to an appeal hearing and Mrs Justice Yip has now upheld that decision.  During an appeal hearing at Manchester Civil Justice Centre last month, Justic Yip said Mr Younis had been described as a ‘sympathetic man who would do what was right’. But not knowing he needed a licence to sell the product was ‘no defence’ for not having one, she said. The judgement read: “The first defendant did not know he needed a licence. His name was not on the local authority’s list and it was therefore unlawful for him to sell it.” The bottle contained highly corrosive caustic soda and had a marked warning to keep it away from children. It would have cost nothing for him to have stocked the bottle on a shelf out of reach of youngsters, she said. She said: “On the facts as found, a dangerous product which should have been kept out of reach of children was being stored somewhere children could reach. It could easily, and without cost, have been put on a higher shelf. There was nothing to suggest that was not practicable or reasonable. “Although what happened was an unlikely occurrence, the risk of exposure to the product was more than negligible.” The judge upheld the decision that Mr Younis is one-third responsible for the injuries suffered by mother and son.  A financial settlement will not be reached until the long-term effects of Ayman’s condition are known. However Slater and Gordon say the defendants have agreed to fund a trip to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, an international centre of excellence for paediatric medicine in the US. Saira added: “I would love to get my son back to normal. It would be a dream come true just to hear his voice again, just to hear him say mum. “I just hope this serves as a warning to other shops and manufacturers to put chemicals out of reach of children. I don’t want another family to have to go through what we have been through.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stag party stranded german city","story":"NewsStag party stranded in German city until Thursday after airport is forced to closeThe group of nine will be stuck in Germany for four days after the airport suffered a blackout on Sunday morning\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJulie GilbertMiranda Blazeby10:34, 4 JUN 2018Updated10:57, 4 JUN 2018NewsThe group don\u0027t understand why they have to wait so long for a flight home (Image: DailyRecord/ WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA stag party have been left stranded in Germany for four days after Hamburg airport suffered a crippling power outage.

Kathryn and Richard Bolton, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, had received the voucher as a Christmas present from their son, Nick.  They tried to use it to book flights to their holiday home in Spain, but received the message: Passenger name doesn’t match.  Confused, they then rang Ryanair - and were reportedly told by the operator that the \u0027correct\u0027 name was Dear Mum Dad. Nick, 34, had written this on the token in place of the recipients\u0027 names.   Kathryn, 60, told The Sun: “The whole thing has been a ludicrous farce. It would be laughable if it wasn’t so annoying.”  The low-cost airline would not accept her and Richard\u0027s voucher because the names didn\u0027t match the ones on their passports. We rang Ryanair – at 13p per minute – and finally a man said, ‘The name doesn’t match, recalled Kathryn, who works in insurance. I asked what the ‘correct’ name was, and he said, ‘Dear Mum Dad.’ I said that’s a salutation, not a name. Ryanair is now reissuing the voucher to the couple following an investigation, according to the newspaper. An airline spokesperson told : “Gift vouchers are valid for use by the voucher recipient only and the name on the voucher must match the name on the passport as per our terms and conditions.

Despite drinking being against the Islamic religion, staff strung up bunting featuring the national flags of the 32 teams playing in this month\u0027s World Cup outside Greene King pubs to celebrate the contest. But they have now been forced to cut all individual Saudi Arabia flags from the bunting following a complaint from Muslims that it offended their religion. They said it was inappropriate to hang the Saudi flag outside pubs as it features the words of a sacred Islamic text in Arabic writing.  The text known as the Shahada is the Islamic statement of faith and reads, There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his Prophet. The flag of Saudi Arabia has a green field with large white Arabic writing above a white horizontal sword. The flags of six other Islamic nations which are competing in the World Cup - Iran, Egpyt, Senegal, Morocco and Tunisia - remain in the bunting. None of the remaining Islamic flags feature Islamic text.

Parents appear to be making two big mistakes that are putting their kids at risk of serious injury - and both are easily avoidable.  Experts came up with the findings after inspecting children\u0027s car seats in more than 3,000 vehicles.  The What Car? study found that the most common errors related to the placement of seatbelts around a car seat, and headrests not being positioned properly.  The checks by experts from Child Seat Safety found that 36 per cent of car seats were incorrectly fitted to the car and 33 per cent of seats were not suitable for the children they were carrying. What Car? said the most common problems with car seats are simple and easy to avoid. More than two out of five (41 per cent) required the seatbelt to be rerouted, and an additional third (30 per cent) needed to adjust the headrest to ensure the seat was safe.  Almost two-thirds (59 per cent) of children are not as safe as they should be in their car seat, according to the study released as part of Child Safety Week. What Car? also found that more than 90 per cent of drivers using a large impact shield-style seat had correctly restrained the child, while only two thirds (61 per cent) of children were secure in a harness style seat. Isofix mounted seats had fewer problems with eight out of 10 (79 per cent) seats correctly fitted, while belted seats only protected 52 per cent of children. Children are legally required to use an appropriate restraint from birth until they are either 12-years-old or 135cm (4ft 4ins) tall.  But road safety practitioners such as Brake urge parents and s to use child car seats until the child is 150cm (almost 5ft) tall, regardless of age, as is the law in many other countries. Experts have encouraged parents to seek child seat fitting advice to make sure their children are restrained properly. Dave Adams, road safety officer with Avon and Somerset Police, which holds about nine child seat inspection days every year, said: “Each event helps around 150 parents ensure their children’s car seats are fitted correctly. “We know that the message is getting through to those whose child seats are checked, because it’s rare for the inspectors to find the same seat incorrectly fitted a second time. “The aim is to offer the e-learning course to other police forces so they can also use it to improve child seat safety in their areas.”  The force has implemented a system where drivers who fail an inspection are educated instead of being given a fine.  The driver is required to complete a 20-minute internet course on the Car Seat Smarter website to learn more about child car seat safety.  Claire Evans, What Car? consumer editor, said: “Ensuring a child is seated safely is vital for all parents but often many don’t realise the mistakes they are making. Taking simple steps such as checking the seatbelt is fitted tightly enough around the seat and making sure the seat is the right size for the child can go a long way to improving children’s safety. “We recommend anyone who transports children in car seats to seek expert fitting advice and ensure they try the seat in their car, ideally with their child in it, before they buy it.” Top 10 child car seat checks from What Car?  What Car? offers the following tips for parents:  1. Is your child too small for the seat? If you’re in any doubt, don’t move them to a bigger seat until you’ve sought the advice of a fitting expert. 2. If the seat is secured by the car seatbelt, check that it is not twisted and that it is fitted tightly enough around the child seat. It should be tight enough that the seat doesn’t move when you push it. 3. If your child has been wearing a bulky jacket during cold weather, the child seat harness may be too loose when he or she switches to wearing thinner clothes, so ensure that it’s still tight enough. To check this, try to pinch the harness in front of your child’s collarbone if you can get a good pinch of fabric between your fingers, it’s too loose. 4. If you’ve adjusted the seat’s head rest because your child has grown, ensure that the harness has been correctly routed back into place.

The 65-year-old shopper was contacted by a cold-caller who claimed to be from the HMRC and threatened her with jail if she didn\u0027t pay missed taxes immediately. He then asked the woman, who remains anonymous, to purchase hundreds of pounds of iTunes vouchers from the Tesco store on Victoria Street - but she was luckily stopped from going through with it by staff who recognised the scam. The woman said: I was absolutely terrified. He said that I owed the government money which I needed to pay immediately or I would be arrested. He warned me that if I didn\u0027t do what he said, I could be fined \u0026pound96,000 and we could lose our house or my husband\u0027s car. He told me that if I spoke to anyone on the way, I would also be arrested.  The woman went to the shop, but luckily staff at Tesco realised what was happening thanks to widespread publicity about the scam and called the police, reports Grimsby Live . The woman continued: They asked me what the vouchers were for, and I told them it was for my grandchildren. When they asked again, I burst out crying and told them what was really happening. The store called the police and the manager even spoke with the conman on the phone, telling him to leave the woman alone. Shockingly, she was the second person who had been targeted that day, and the scammer had asked for even more from the other victim, who was also prevented from making the purchase. The woman said the incident has left her shaken.  She added: I have asthma, and my chest has been tight all day since it happened. If I\u0027d had a heart condition, it could have been much, much worse. The police warned residents earlier this month about scams involving gift cards or iTunes vouchers. A statement from the force said: We have received a number of recent reports of fraudsters contacting victims via telephone and demanding payment by way of gift card or iTunes vouchers. A recent victim gave away over \u0026pound200 by purchasing iTunes vouchers and providing the codes to the suspect.

Debra Demetriou claims the blurry snap was taken when she was home alone and her house was locked. Taken from the foot of her bed, it shows her with her eyes half open and the covers tucked over her chin. The stay-at-home mum insists her Samsung S7 was under her pillow when she fell asleep, and it was still there when she woke up hours later, Chronicle Live reports.  Debra, from Benton, Newcastle, said she discovered the photo while scrolling through pictures from the night before. She said: “There was nobody else in the house at the time - I was completely freaked out. She said her oldest son left for work 45 minutes before the picture was taken, and her other son was with his dad. The house was locked, untouched from the night before, and there were no signs of a break in, she added.  Debra said: “I know you shouldn’t, but my phone had been under my pillow when I fell asleep. “It was still there the next morning. “I held down the picture to see the movement, and you can see both my arms are by my side so it couldn’t even have been a selfie. “And my eyes are half-open - if someone else had been in the room I’m sure I would have noticed them. “I’m absolutely convinced nobody else was in the house.”  The eerie snap has left her full of dread. She can’t stop thinking about who took it. Paranormal investigator Sammy Rawlinson has examined the image and admits it is “spooky”. The Stockton psychic added: “Spirits do things to get our attention. “If someone has passed in the last year it could be them trying to get her attention.”  Debra has lost both parents, but not that recently. However she admits this isn’t the first time something “strange” has happened to her. Pictures from her son’s last birthday contained, according to a clairvoyant, “ghosts” of deceased family members. But Debra isn’t sure. And she isn’t sure how this picture was taken.

our wedding night","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFrom meeting in a kebab shop to ending their wedding night with a pizza, Oliver and Alanah Gardner did things a bit differently.Oliver, 26, and Alanah, 22, met in a city centre takeaway four years ago after a night in the students’ union.From then on, the pair were inseparable and moved in together after just four months.Oliver, a postman, said: “I had a small bedsit and Alanah came to stay one night and just never left.”Nursery teacher Alanah added: “It sounds a bit like I trapped him, doesn’t it?”Oliver popped the question in September – although not in the way he had originally planned.“I had bought the ring well in advance and was planning to propose on holiday in Berlin,” he said.“But Alanah found the receipt in the flat so I had to try to surprise her because she knew it was coming.“One random Saturday, I printed off lots of pictures of us and hung them around the flat and put my suit on.”On May 19, just eight months after their engagement, the couple – from the city centre – were married at Taypark House.Oliver was supported by best man Kyle Lafferty and Alanah had bridesmaids Harriet Gardner, Sian Anderson and Nicola Gatrick by her side.Alanah said: “It was an amazing day. All of our families were there and we were so lucky with the weather.”In tribute to Oliver’s gran – a massive Rod Stewart fan who died in February – Alanah’s brother-in-law Stevie Anderson sang the star’s hit Maggie May.Oliver said: “I wanted to have something for my gran as she was really excited about the wedding and had even picked her outfit. It was very important.”The couple had their first dance to Days Like This by Van Morrison.The photographs were taken by their good friend Jake Watson.Oliver said: “It was the first time he had ever taken wedding photos and he did an amazing job.”Alanah added: “He even made us a surprise wedding video and it is absolutely beautiful. It was a lovely touch.”After saying “I do” and dancing the night away, the couple retreated to their hotel room – but it wasn’t the romantic encounter you might have expected.Alanah said:“We went back to our room about 2am and ordered a pizza and watched Road Wars. It was perfect.”The happy pair would like to say a special thanks to wedding co-ordinator Alanna Watson, registrar Margaret Campbell and to both sets of family and friends who made it a day to remember.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b11601f0db9d.jpg ","title":"dundee united invest 20000 so tannadice continues to be one of the best surfaces in the country","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are investing over £20,000 this summer to make sure they have the best playing surface in the Championship.Since manager Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November, he’s stressed the need for a pristine pitch to match the passing style he wants from the Tangerines.And while last season the surface was the envy of most of their second-tier rivals, the board have stumped up five figures to make sure it’s even better next term and beyond.They announced this week the existing turf has been lifted and a process known as vertical sand-banding started.While that’s a complicated, as well as expensive, process, the new and improved pitch will be ready when the first of the Betfred Cup group matches kick off there in as little as six weeks.The work being carried out will also improve drainage – something that has been a problem, particularly in the area near the tunnel at the Eddie Thompson Stand end of Tannadice.And, while most of the budget for the next 12 months is going on putting together a squad capable of winning promotion, chairman Mike Martin is viewing the pitch project as a sound investment.“We are investing in our on and off-field operations in a structured way with every aspect of our work designed to deliver improvement throughout the club,” he said.“In this case, we aim to make sure that Tannadice continues to be one of the best surfaces in the country for playing professional football.”Those Betfred Cup fixtures are expected to be confirmed next week with league fixtures out on June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united target aberdeen goalkeeper danny rogers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs their summer of signing continues, Dundee United could turn to Aberdeen goalkeeper Danny Rogers to help fill the gaps in their last line of defence.With Deniz Mehmet out long term and Harry Lewis back at Southampton, the Tangerines are on the hunt for two first-team goalies.And 24-year-old Rogers is one name on their list of possible additions.New York born and an American citizen, Rogers was capped nine times at U/21 level for the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualifies through his Irish mother.He’s only played a handful of games for the Dons in six years at Pittodrie, but has over 100 top-team appearances under his belt during loan spells at Airdrie, Dumbarton and Falkirk.Most of those games came during a two-year spell with Falkirk between 2015 and 2017.He recently signed a two-year contract extension but could be available on loan again.Deniz, meanwhile, is now likely to have the operation to repair knee ligament damage next week.It was scheduled for early last week but the surgeon in England decided to delay it because the joint he damaged against Dunfermline in the play-offs last month remained swollen.He’s likely to be out until around the turn of the year.The Tangerines, meanwhile, have confirmed the signing of young Celtic defender Sam Wardrop and it’s understood Dunfermline’s Fraser Aird will be revealed as another member of the squad over the next few days.A deal for Wardrop was agreed with the Hoops last week and the 20-year-old joins on a two-year contract.The right-back has represented Scotland at U/15, U/16, U/17 and U/19 levels and captained Celtic’s Youth team to Scottish Cup victory in 2016.“Sam is an athletic and energetic defender who likes to get forward and attack the opposition. I am pleased that we have secured his signing,” said boss Csaba Laszlo.“We must build a squad capable of winning the Championship, and he will be an important part of the squad next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0fc28eb0d71-400x564.jpg ","title":"no barrier for youth at dundee as dens becoming the place for youngsters to flourish","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee is fast becoming the place for youth to shine in the Premiership with manager Neil McCann saying there’s “no barrier” to youngsters stepping up the first team.Eight players from the Development U/20s side made the move up throughout the last campaign, some for just one game, others for a lot longer.The stand-out among them, though he dropped out of the top-team picture since the winter, Kerr Waddell, picked up the club’s Young Player of the Year award after an impressive debut season that saw him make 22 appearances, scoring three times.Joining him on the field with the senior men were Jesse Curran (eight appearances), Matty Henvey (4), Cedwyn Scott (three), Calum Ferrie (two), Dan Jefferies (two), Jack Lambert (two) and Jordan Piggott (one).And gaffer Neil has laid down the challenge to his young charges to prove to him they are better than his existing squad players as well as the names he’s looking to bring in via the transfer market.He said: “There shouldn’t be limits on the kids. I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope. Clearly there is a physical aspect and I need to know that should I need it or think he is ready ability-wise, is he physically ready?“There are boys there coming through our Development team and all have been told that in the upcoming season, you have to come in here in pre-season and tell me I am pushing.“There is no barrier. It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early. However, they look to have been priced out of that deal.On Thursday the club did announce a capture in the shape of Ralph on a two-year deal.Moving up from the English non-league, he said: “I know the level is better than what I have been playing at recently so I’m looking to test myself as much as possible.“I feel like I’m good enough to play at this level. I’m excited, looking forward to it.”He also revealed he’d been persuaded to make the move north by new team-mate Roarie Deacon, with both players clients of OYS Sports Management along with Glen Kamara.Ralph added: “I’ve heard a lot of good things about the club.“I spoke to a few people as well, the likes of Roarie Deacon who said it’s a good place to come, play good football and the manager will improve me.“That’s pretty much everything I was looking for.“I am energetic, I like to attack.“I’m a left-back but I like to get forward as well.“I would say I’m decent in the air.“I like to try

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding.This is \u0026pound17.1 million more to support services compared to last year taken together with the decision to increase their council tax by three per cent.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users.

A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted. The Stratton development has been approved and is in accordance with the local development plan.\"Monday 4 Jun 2018 1:36

I enjoyed Peru as well, it was brilliant and something that I’ll definitely learn from.”The Scots found it tough against the World Cup-bound Mexicans whose side contained the likes of ex-Barcelona and Tottenham player Giovani dos Santos, former Arsenal man Carlos Vela and Barcelona legend Rafael Marquez.The performance of Shinnie at left-back and Don Scott McKenna skippering the team in just his fourth cap were two positives.Shinnie added: “We were trying to keep our shape as best we could.“We knew that they would move and pass the ball about well so when we turned the ball over we were trying to keep it ourselves and get ourselves forward.“It was tough to do it, but when we did do it, especially second half, we had a good go.“We’re disappointed, Oli McBurnie has one off the post and we were desperate for it to go in.“But I think second half we definitely came into it more and got forward a lot more and created a lot more problems.”Conditions were gruelling with the stadium in Mexico City being 7,200 feet above sea level. Shinnie said: “It was tough, at one point in the first half I felt like I was swallowing sand.“It was good, it’s different experiences and it’s something that I’ll potentially never experience again.”Scotland boss Alex McLeish has been pleased with the trip to South America overall, despite the losses to both Peru and Mexico.The Gothenburg Great said: “The trip has been great, the players have been very professional.“Normally they would be on their holidays. We would love to be going to the World Cup the same as Mexico.“But we have played a couple of games that can help us build for the future.“It was a very tough game for us at altitude and in these conditions.“I think the players that we had out there did the country proud.“We are trying to get better on the technical side and we have asked the players to look at their game and be brave, to make passes and receive passes.“It’s a big part of the plan going forward.”One frustration for McLeish was Scotland’s lack of threat in attack.He added: “We looked to be more of a threat, to get players forward in the box. I felt that we never had the best of deliveries. When we got into wide areas, we hit the first man a lot when we had good presence in the box.“You saw when we got a good cross in the second half, McBurnie had a good header, he was unlucky he hit the post. In the first-half, we had crosses potentially for the strength of Callum Paterson but we didn’t quite succeed.“Both teams made changes, that can upset the rhythm of the game, but both teams did what they could to impress the fans and the coaches.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shinnie and mckenna earn pass marks for scotland as manager mcleish takes first strides on road to lifting hopes of a

famous Azteca Stadium with the only real positives being McKenna as skipper and another solid display from Dons captain Graeme Shinnie who played the whole game.The superiority of the World Cup-bound Mexicans was clear with the Scots only creating one clear-cut opportunity in what was a largely forgettable 90 minutes for the Tartan Army as they watched a team lacking in creativity.The merits of Scotland’s trip to South America at the end of a long season have to be questioned – but the tour has been a successful one for the Dons in Alex McLeish’s squad.Pittodrie skipper Shinnie has finally been given his opportunity and he has shown what many of us have known for a while: that he is capable of playing at international level.While McKenna’s fairy tale continues.The 21-year-old had already had a dream season breaking into the Aberdeen team and winning his first two caps for the national side in March.But on this trip McKenna has doubled his tally to four and has now captained Scotland.Gothenburg Great McLeish seems keen to build his defence going forward into the Uefa Nations League and the European Championship qualifiers around McKenna.He clearly has total confidence in the youngster and for McKenna to skipper the Dark Blues in just his fourth cap is an incredible achievement and he was one of Scotland’s best performers in what was a disappointing display.He is following in the footsteps of Aberdeen legends like Martin Buchan, Willie Miller, McLeish and Jim Leighton in captaining his country.Seven changes were made to the side which lost 2-0 to Peru in Lima last Wednesday morning.Jordan Archer, Charlie Mulgrew, Lewis Stevenson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Jamie Murphy and Matt Philips dropped out.McLeish drafted in keeper Jon McLaughlin, Jack Hendry, Shinnie, Johnny Russell, Callum Paterson, former Dons loanee Ryan Christie and Oliver McBurnie to start.The changes were necessary due to the heat in the famous Azteca Stadium as well as the altitude, with the ground being 7,200 feet above sea level.But after only 13 minutes the Scots found themselves trailing.Edson Alvarez crossed from the right, Giovani dos Santos slipped the ball on to Carlos Vela just inside the area, he turned and Hendry’s slip allowed the former Arsenal man to square for Dos Santos who fired a low shot past McLaughlin from 18 yards with his left foot.The Scots were struggling to get the ball and string more than two passes together as the first period wore on.Former Aberdeen man Kenny McLean was the only player in Scotland’s midfield who seemed to have the confidence to try to keep possession and build attacks.Mexico could have doubled their lead just before the half hour when Miguel Layun’s 25-yard curler came back off the right post.McLaughlin made a decent save from Hirving Lozano’s long-range effort as the one-way traffic towards Scotland’s goal continued.At the start of the second period sub keeper Scott Bain made saves from Lozano and Hector Herrera in the opening 70 seconds.Then on 49 minutes McBurnie hit the right post with a powerful header from 10 yards after Russell crossed from the right.After not creating a chance in the first half this was more promising from the Scots.But on 53 minutes they were fortunate not to concede when Mexico broke at speed from a Scotland corner.At the end of the move Vela was free and could have shot but opted to cut back for Layun, but Shinnie and Bain smothered his effort.Scotland were given another let-off with 25 minutes left when Lozano blasted off the crossbar from 10 yards after getting away from sub Charlie Mulgrew.Sub Oribe Peralta had the ball in the Scots net with 18 minutes left but he was flagged offside.Despite Scotland’s best efforts in the closing stages they were unable to salvage a draw.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now.

That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017.

Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe.
