We fell in love and honestly, her love was too much for me to handle. It was a lot to handle, to take in.\u0027 \u0027As time went on our relationship took so many changes from being boyfriend and girlfriend, to being lovers, to being best friends. To being just straight up homies, like, someone you know you can count on. Somebody that has your back, you have their back.\u0027  While Diddy did not break down during the ceremony, at one moment he stopped and said: \u0027We didn\u0027t really plan for this\u0027. \u0027I definitely thought I was going to go first,\u0027 he continued. \u0027God didn\u0027t have it be that way.\u0027   Diddy then addressed the three children he shared with Porter, their son Christian, 20, and 11-year-old twin daughters Jessie James and D\u0027Lila, as well as Porter\u0027s firstborn Quincy Brown, 27. \u0027Your mother instilled in me this, and I pledge in front of everyone now, I will always be there for y\u0027all,\u0027 he told them.

I\u0027m not like, Oh, she\u0027s not here. People leave in the physical. But their energy, their vibration, their frequency, it lives on forever.\u0027  He then thanked the crowd for coming before addressing Porter herself. \u0027Kim, we\u0027re going to miss you so much,\u0027 Diddy said. \u0027But I ain\u0027t going to miss you too much because I\u0027m not going to let your voice inside of me stop talking.\u0027\u0027I know you like to talk to me a lot once you get on those rants,\u0027 he added as the crowd laughed. \u0027I just want you to know, I\u0027m going to be listening,\u0027 Diddy continued. \u0027We love you, we appreciate you, to all the words I\u0027m forgetting, to everything I\u0027m forgetting to say, we love you Kim.

Some people that live and have lived here have had quite a lot of connections to Glastonbury and other music scenes. \u0027I came over with a guy who was working on the White House over here, it was getting built at the time. \u0027Then he left and I stayed. I realised I\u0027d quite like to be here and started to ask around for places to live. I got offered two places.\u0027It\u0027s by no means idealistic and it has its own hardships of the wind and the rain.\u0027You are exposed to the elements - but that\u0027s good also as you are aware of what the weather is doing all the time and you\u0027re very much in touch with nature and the elements and life.\u0027We\u0027re an ageing population but I guess the bulk of us are between 40 and 65.\u0027There are not so many people that are younger than us, apart from the kids obviously. \u0027I am the post-person three days a week, sub-contracted by the Royal Mail.\u0027I am responsible for everybody\u0027s important post and for transporting it across the loch as dryly and as safely as possible. \u0027I have a sea-taxi business, which runs a regular sea-ferry service, but a lot of people have their own boat and there is also a communal boat.\u0027          Lisa has lived on the peninsula for 23 years and is responsible for the post on the peninsula. Here she works in the garden          Lisa with one of two post boxes on the peninsula.  The black post box next to it is used for Scoraig\u0027s internal mail          Lisa, who decided to move to the peninsula after attending a music festival on it,  skippering the ferry which she uses for her sea-taxi service Chisa, 28\u0027If you speak to anybody here, they will all say that they are getting away from the value system that tells you you ought to be this way or that way, to be valued by your peers or whatever it is which doesn\u0027t resonate with everybody.\u0027They are trying to create their own idea of utopia.\u0027I\u0027m here for more selfish reasons - I don\u0027t want to be surrounded by other people\u0027s judgements.\u0027I have now been here for five years. I came here as a couple, with our son, but we have now split up but still both live here.\u0027Every year, I go back to Russia and leave my son with my ex.\u0027I love it because I enjoy the ballet I can do there and I prefer the mentality, the toughness and resilience to change.\u0027Russians have an ability to withstand anything.\u0027          Chisa has lived on the island for five years and said she likes being there as she doesn\u0027t want to be surrounded by other people\u0027s judgementsAggie, 65\u0027The first time I came here, it just felt like home to me. It was November 1975.\u0027It worried me slightly that we moved here as I cannot swim and I had young children.\u0027We needed somewhere to live and it wasn\u0027t enough to put me off as we had the option to walk in and out as well.\u0027I like living here because I like to know where everything comes from, to know myself what the situation is with my electricity and what to do when it goes wrong and the same goes for the water too.\u0027I think we were very lucky to have Hugh come here and do his windmills.\u0027By now, I guess, solar would have come in if wind hadn\u0027t - and we were just relying on Tilley lamps.\u0027Everybody expects washing machines now here and everybody has one apart from me. I\u0027m the last person washing by hand here.\u0027          Aggie came to the Scoraig in 1975 and is the last person to be washing their clothes on the peninsulaDale, 47 \u0027I was fed up with working in an office all day looking at a screen and having to pay to go to a gym to keep fit.\u0027I was fed up with all the people - it would take me 40 minutes to drive seven miles to get into work.\u0027We could have moved not so far away but I had been to Scotland a few times and fancied it.\u0027There is a proper sense of community here, which I think is lacking in other parts of the country.\u0027Everybody knows everybody and everybody helps each other out.\u0027It\u0027s the environmental thing, where you can live from solar and wind power and you don\u0027t need coal and nuclear power.\u0027And because you know what you are consuming, where your water comes from and your power, you are always going to be environmentally friendly.\u0027I used to preach about environmental stuff and then go home and put my 48in flat-screen TV on - but here, you can really live it.\u0027          Dale was fed up working in an office so decided to up sticks and enjoy a remote lifestyle on Scoraig Jeannie,  60    \u0027I moved from California and go back when I can to visit. I came here and I saw this place and I was walking down to Ruigh\u0027riabhach from Scoraig pier, and one of the Icelandic ponies that lived here walked me down the track and I saw the Beinn, and I knew it was home, it was a totally strong feeling. I had already spent several years travelling around Scotland and the islands and had run a bed and breakfast for a couple years on the Black Isle.\u0027\u0027I was the first in the new wave here in 1995. Since then many more people have come to live here, more adults and some children, some older adults and younger children. \u0027I had been living on the Black Isle for a few years and I was visiting Scotland, it¿s kind of a long story. I came here to work at a retreat centre where Luke and Pixie live now and Tom had built it with his former wife, it\u0027s so stunning. It\u0027s this incredible giant hand made house. \u0027Tom was there on his own, still married to Sundara who lived in Glasgow and I met Tom. Maybe a couple of months later we started travelling in the Highlands and working. We built a reed bed sewage system for a hostel in Glen Affric. It was a good summer, hot like this one. We travelled for 7 months and we came back and moved into Tom\u0027s bothy. \u0027There was nothing, just rock, heather and everything happened from there. Tom and I fell in love and we had our daughter Ise, it\u0027s Gaelic, it means \u0027herself\u0027. She lives in Ullapool. I have never wanted stuff, it doesn\u0027t suit me I guess. I never felt that sense of entitlement which isn\u0027t exclusively American but which many Americans, and others, seem to feel. I hate that word \u0027ex-pat\u0027 it\u0027s just not it.\u0027           Jeannie is a California native. She moved to Scoraig after several years living in Scotland. She was first of the 1995 \u0027new wave\u0027 Tommy,  50 \u0027I was born in Sydney, in Australia. I lived there about a year and then I travelled with my parents at the age of about 1 throughout Asia including the Soviet Union. They had a multi stop ticket home and stopped at the maximum number of locations that was permitted by the ticket. \u0027My parents hadn\u0027t moved here yet, we lived in a small village in Northamptonshire. I was 6 when we moved here. I did like it here, I liked the freedom to roam about and I was obsessed with fishing so from a very early age I was taking myself down to the shore with a hook and line and catching fish and running around with the other children as normal. Perhaps I was nostalgic for my previous home. I think everyone always is a little nostalgic, I think, especially for children, there is always nostalgia, it\u0027s universal.\u0027I am currently working at the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, at the Institute of Philosophy and Law. At our department (Foreign Languages), PhD students are helped to communicate in academic English. My primary role there is to support my scientific colleagues in both written and spoken academic English. \u0027I\u0027ve been to quite a few other small places, especially working with broadband on the islands, and people have quite often compared Scoraig with to the island of Eigg.\u0027I am pretty sure they don\u0027t lock their doors on Eigg either, but obviously if people go away for long periods of time they do lock their doors. Generally, there are very low levels of crime here and people trust each other and look out for each other. Perhaps the main difference is the geographical isolation – if you were to have a thief here, where would he keep the stolen goods? It\u0027s darned difficult to thieve from here especially if you don\u0027t want to get caught!\u0027          Tommy was born in Sydney, Australia.  He works at the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences  supporting scientific colleagues in both written and spoken academic English           Estha, 42\u0027I was born in Inverness, my Mum Russ hitched in to have me so I hear. Nigel is my step Dad. We have lived in a few places, I lived over the side at Achmore which is even more remote than Scoraig and also down by the pier by Jonah and Rhona\u0027s at the shop where the post box is.\u0027I was in Ullapool for a year just working, it was great because I was 16, just that there were boys around, that sort of stuff. I don\u0027t know about living in another place to bring up kids as I\u0027ve always been here. \u0027Growing up here was brilliant, we were always outside and could do pretty much anything as long as we came home for dinner. We\u0027d go in boats, do lobster pots, at about 11 years of age. \u0027Even at school lunch break we\u0027d go down to the sea to go swimming, to pick muscles and have a fire and cook them on the shore. Not everyone but some people would pick winkles to get money, on their own. \u0027I think because there was such a large group of us that our parents never worried because there was always somebody older looking after us. Parents were always aware of where we were on Scoraig and half keeping an eye out for us. \u0027We\u0027d go camping on the hill and my friend built himself a little house that he lived in when he was 13. He was very independent and his dad was an artist, just that he would take over the whole house. Personally I would choose to bring children up here which is why I am here but the only thing I feel that I missed out on was dancing, a dance school. \u0027A family came here recently with a small child and they came round and asked how we managed as there is so much danger, the sea down there and the cows and the list went on. And I said how do you manage in a town with all the cars and all the people everywhere.\u0027          Estha enjoyed his childhood on the island. He said: \u0027Growing up here was brilliant, we were always outside and could do pretty much anything as long as we came home for dinner\u0027          Scoraig is only accessible by boat or a five mile walk and its homes and school are powered by wind.  Scoraig\u0027s jetty is pictured Anthea, 73\u0027The air here is so good, that\u0027s my secret to good age, and lots of exercising, laughing, enjoying life and good friends. I come from Lancashire, near Preston. \u0027I didn\u0027t choose to come up here, I was in a very stressful job, I worked for a mental health day centre and my husband said that I needed to get a way because of stress so we sold the house and bought a converted ambulance which had a caravan attached to it. \u0027It was a friend\u0027s and they didn\u0027t want it anymore. We just set off on the road, we didn\u0027t know where we going. Jeff my husband didn\u0027t have a car licence so had a Robin Reliant and he was the scout, he searched for places to go. We spent a couple of weeks getting here, and we ended up on the Faine, it\u0027s the long stretch from Braymore junction to Dundonnell. We parked there for about a week and then the police said you\u0027re on the land that belongs to the laird and you\u0027d better move on. \u0027So we both decided we\u0027d better have a look to see if there was anywhere else we could park.We had an accident with the Robin Reliant, we skidded in a flash flood, rolled over and went along on the roof.\u0027We went to the hotel and the lassie behind the bar said why don\u0027t you go and park at the car park at Badlaurach jetty which is the one opposite here. We stayed in the car park and got to know a few of the people that live here. We sold the ambulance and caravan because we were offered a place on the apportionment of the croft, a bit of land that isn¿t any good. We bought another caravan and brought it over on a scallop raft and towed it to here. \u0027We lived in it and built a shack on the side with a funny little stove in it and we managed. We had no electricity and we had storm lanterns and candle light. Then we got a little windmill and had a bit of electricity going in. Things happen in life for a reason as far as I\u0027m concerned and I was meant to come here. We had never heard of Scoraig and had gone around the top of Scotland a couple of times but ended up just heading this way.\u0027           Anthea and her husband set off to Scoraig in a converted ambulance which had a caravan attached to it. She didn\u0027t have a plan for where she was going when she set off  Sandy, 64\u0027I\u0027ve been here 3 years. I fell in love with it in the 80s with the free festivals then I fell in love with it again when the Mother of my youngest moved here and I would visit. I heard about the free festivals through a hippy friend.\u0027A tiny bit was the attraction of coming here by boat. It has an attractiveness of its own, it segregates the community from the world at large which allows it a freedom, a privilege which is right up my street. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve felt at home my entire life - I don\u0027t have any neighbours who would rather I wasn\u0027t here.\u0027I tend to be a bit of an outsider and my response is to hide under a stone and I have always felt that society was going to give me a hard time. I\u0027ve always got on with lots of people but there were always some people who didn\u0027t want me around, that\u0027s what I felt like. \u0027The big signifier here now is that I belong to a committee, I would have laughed at anybody ten years ago that said this would be a possibility but I feel a part of the community. \u0027That\u0027s what I came here for and that\u0027s what I\u0027ve got. It\u0027s because of its history and because of its remoteness. It\u0027s because it went from old crofters to new incoming hippies.\u0027          Sandy, here at home, said he has always regarded himself as an outsider but enjoys being part of the community on Scoraig Claire, 27, and Damien, 27 \u0027I am French and was born in Poitiers. I arrived first in Scotland in March and Damien arrived in May. We began our relationship in France one week before I left to come here to Scotland.\u0027I had already planned my travel with the WWOOFiNG before we met. I had already been here 6 years ago with my brother for just 2 weeks and I had already travelled a bit and my favourite country was Scotland. \u0027I wanted to go to a white country and an English speaking country. I was looking ta WWOOFING online and wanted to do gardening and I am vegetarian so didn\u0027t want to work with livestock so I saw this place and it looked really beautiful. \u0027My main destination was Shetland, that was the centre of my travel but I planned all of my WWOOFING before leaving France and wanted to come here after seeing the photos. I saw that you have to take a boat here, that was interesting for me, I really wanted to be isolated, I needed it. I lived in Paris for a few months at a friend\u0027s house and I had too many simulations in big cities and I wanted to find myself and be in an isolated place. \u0027I mostly chose isolated places like Shetland, Lewis and here. I\u0027ve been around too many people, too much information, it\u0027s too stressful and exhausting. I come from the countryside, I need to have peace, I really need it. \u0027I  cannot stand to be in cities anymore. I need simple ways to live and I found it in Scoraig.\u0027            Claire and Damien are newcomers to the island. Claire arrived first in Scotland in March and Damien arrived in MayNigel, 62, and Ross, 68  \u0027It was 1970, I was at teaching training college and in my 3rd year I thought I\u0027d had enough, and my room mate at college and I hitched up here from Bradford, with Kath who also lives here now, without knowing where we would be going, it was either Scotland or Ireland.\u0027We were looking for a place to stay, it was November time and we asked a tourist agency for a place to stay and Alan Bush was a name that was offered. They answered the one phone on the peninsula and they said come and have a look and so we jumped on a boat. \u0027Both Kath and I weren\u0027t attending that well, so we both left in our 3rd year. We didn\u0027t like the crowds and wanted to go north. It was very different then, there were no wind powers, there were Tilly lamps and bucketing water. I think the peace made me stay, I think I used to want to travel around a lot to other countries but I remember walking up to the top of the local hill and I looked out and thought I wouldn\u0027t be able to find anywhere else with the same beauty and tranquillity and then the years just fly by.  \u0027It was 1979 I met Nigel. When I first came here you could see right across the peninsula but now with the growth of trees it is not as open as it was, and the wood is useful for fuel. The forestry commission wanted trees planted and we needed shelter really so a lot of trees were planted.  \u0027I always admired what they achieved, they did the original tracks here and houses and cleared the stones from the fields with horses, lots of children and lots of hardship. People might think it is hard living here but it\u0027s nothing like the hardship they had, if you keep that in your mind it keeps things in perspective. To do with world affairs it\u0027s hardly hardship. We\u0027re alot better than Syria, Afghanistan and most of Africa. The government is absolutely terrible, I just can\u0027t believe how the power is in the hands off so few people. I wonder what their vision of utopia is.\u0027  Ross move to the island in 1979. She was at a teaching training college in her 3rd year and had enough when she decided to move to the peninsula. She met her partner Nigel in 1979 "},{"url":null,"title":"Horrified Pets Home customer discovers nest SIX mice inside box cat scratch post","story":"Rebekah Phillips discovered the nest of rodents when she unwrapped her new Avery Ascent Cat Scratch Tower last weekThe six mice had left the cardboard packaging \u0027urine-soaked\u0027 - and the corpses of two dead mice in the box added to the stench, Ms Phillips said.But as the Macclesfield branch of Pets at Home had since closed, the finance assistant eventually decided to free the rodents in her garden.Feline very brave!

The tree, pictured, been earmarked for destruction as part of the building of a new three-storey \u0027super surgery\u0027 medical centre in the commuter townMr Hood said his protest mirrored similar ones across the country designed to make local councils think about the effect of removing trees and bulldozing green space.And he said that unless people took direct action their towns and villages would be reduced to grey concrete piles.Mr Hood, a gardener, has taken time off work to organise someone being in the tree 24 hours a day.He said: \u0027We have people here during the night. We also have people who live across the road and I live around the corner. We are keeping an eye on it all the time - it\u0027s a 24-hour sit-in.

The current allegations could see Ghosn facing 10 years behind bars andor a 10-million-yen fine.Separately, Kyodo has reported that Nissan paid $100,000 annually since 2002 to Ghosn\u0027s sister for a non-existent \u0027advisory\u0027 role.And the Mainichi Shimbun reported on Monday that Ghosn used Nissan\u0027s corporate money to pay a donation to his daughter\u0027s university and also charged family trips to the company.Both Ghosn and Kelly have reportedly denied the allegations.   Mitsubishi Motors Corp.

It employs around 450,000 people worldwide.But the future of the tie-up is now uncertain as the talismanic Ghosn was seen as the glue binding together a fractious Franco-Japanese alliance with headquarters 10,000 kilometres (6,000 miles) apart.\u0027We (have) had two years of the alliance and there were positive parts... and parts that needed to be revised a little from Mitsubishi Motors\u0027 point of view,\u0027 said Masuko. Nissan board vote unanimously to fire disgraced chairman...Nissan chairman is arrested after \u0027£34m pay swindle that saw...Car makers fear they won\u0027t \u0027survive\u0027 in Britain due Theresa...Share this articleA seven-person Nissan board, the parent company of Mitsubishi, decided unanimously on Thursday to jettison the once-revered leader Nissan\u0027s current CEO Hiroto Saikawa told staff on Monday he was \u0027shocked\u0027 at his former mentor\u0027s alleged misconduct.At a 45-minute meeting attended by hundreds of staff at the firm\u0027s Yokohama HQ and broadcast internally to other sites, Saikawa stressed that the scandal should not affect day-to-day operations.Saikawa, who rose through the Nissan ranks under Ghosn\u0027s wing, has already spoken of his \u0027great resentment and dismay\u0027 at the allegations.According to Japanese media, Nissan formed a \u0027secret\u0027 cell within the firm to look into the alleged financial misdeeds.Executives accelerated the probe amid concerns Ghosn was working on a fully fledged merger between Nissan and Renault, Kyodo News said without naming its sources.

Not to do so would be irresponsible. It needs to be someone palatable to the Japanese and the French.\u0027Investors appeared to be recovering from the initial shock of the arrest, which sent shares in all three firms tumbling.At the Tokyo close, Nissan was up nearly two percent and Mitsubishi Motors enjoyed an even sharper bump - up more than three percent just ahead of the board meeting. "},{"url":null,"title":"No 10 calls meeting LABOUR MPs beg help passing deal","story":"The PM (pictured in Downing Street today) is briefing ministers on the dramatic developments in Brussels over the weekend - and how she hopes to win over mutinous MPs to her plan          Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer today suggested Brexit could be delayed as fresh negotiations are held.Juncker says EU failings had NOTHING to do with Brexit as he...\u0027Nuclear meltdown is about to take place\u0027: Cabinet misery as...Share this articleSir Keir told BBC Radio 4 Today Programme that Article 50 could be delayed - allowing a fresh set of talks to be launched. He said: ‘If you had the vast majority saying we don’t authorise the government leaving with no deal it would be very difficult for the government politically to do so‘I accept that might not be legally binding there would then have to be legislation before March for any government preparing for no deal and there would be plenty of opportunity to put down amendments to require the government to do things.‘For example to extend Article 50.‘Now I accept that stopping no deal is something that is going to have to involve the whole of the UK but I think there would be a very strong push by a majority in parliament against no deal\u0027And I don’t think this Prime Minister would simply plough on regardless because she knows how dangerous a no deal is.\u0027          There is a growing push to get Jeremy Corbyn (pictured)  to back a second referendum if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down by MPs next month.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177582b5ecb745aa385099fef8e18ca6588986be/0_4267_6493_3895/master/6493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e94654665d8b4a771ee3b96910004131","title":"own a limited edition print from photographer jane bown","story":"Jane Bown joined the Observer in 1949 and over the next six decades created a remarkably singular body of work that straddled all areas of photojournalism.

Consumption spikes on match days but not as much as in the past because of energy-efficient LED floodlights.While other UK football clubs have installed solar panels and similar green measures, Arsenal is believed to be the first with large-scale storage.Matt Allen, the chief executive of energy firm Pivot Power, which installed the batteries, said: “Arsenal is showing how football clubs and other big power users can save money and support the UK’s climate change and clean air targets.”The system is not designed to stop the need for diesel generators for back-up power.Instead, it will be used to buy power from the renewable electricity supplier Octopus Energy at cheap times and sell it during more expensive peak periods, and earn money by providing services to National Grid.The financial model is akin to the rent-your-roof model pushed by solar firms, with the batteries paid for by the investment manager Downing, operated by Pivot Power and Arsenal leasing out the space, and the three sharing the cost savings and revenues.An initial 2MW of capacity will be expanded to a total of 3MW next summer.Allen said he would like to bring storage to more football clubs, but his “laser-like” focus was to establish a nationwide network of “superhubs”, with much larger, 50MW grid-scale batteries capable of recharging about 100 electric cars at a time. The first two, in Southampton and Carlisle, are expected to be built by October next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0cfddad5db08379bceb372cfc5df808c37f4969/0_211_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70432429ed166f29c517b7322ca681ce","title":"carlos ghosn sacked mitsubishi motors nissan","story":"Carmaker’s board follows Nissan in ousting executive after misconduct allegationsCarlos Ghosn has been sacked as chairman of Mitsubishi Motors, a week after he was arrested over allegations that he under-reported his income by millions of dollars – a crime that carries a possible 10-year prison sentence.Seven of the eight members of the board of Mitsubishi, part of an industry alliance created by Ghosn that also includes Renault, held an extraordinary meeting on Monday to decide his fate, days after Nissan sacked him as chairman.Ghosn, who allegedly also abused company assets for personal use, remains in detention in Tokyo but has reportedly denied the allegations, according to Japanese media.In a statement, Mitsubishi said “Ghosn has lost the confidence of Nissan” and it was “difficult for him to fulfil his duties”.The Mitsubishi chief executive, Osamu Masuko, who will become acting chairman, declined to comment on the criminal case but said he had been taken aback by Ghosn’s arrest.“To be honest, I was shocked and I couldn’t believe it,” he told reporters at Mitsubishi’s headquarters. “I still can’t figure out why and I just don’t understand.”The group became the world’s biggest-selling car company, with about 10.6m vehicles rolling off the production line last year. It employs about 450,000 people worldwide.Masuko insisted the alliance would survive the scandal, saying collaboration on new technologies such as driverless vehicles would help secure the companies’ futures. “We believe the alliance is needed,” he said. “Where the three companies are headed is not confrontation.”While Nissan vowed to retain its ties to Renault, reports in Japan claimed the former’s executives were disturbed by Ghosn’s plans to turn the alliance into a full-blown merger.Executives from all three businesses will meet in Amsterdam later this week to discuss the fallout from Ghosn’s arrest.The Nissan chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, told staff on Monday its alliance with Renault was “not equal”, a week after he launched a scathing verbal attack on the “dark side of the Ghosn era” at the company.In a 45-minute address to hundreds of staff at the company’s Yokohama headquarters that was also shown live to Nissan factories and offices across Japan, Saikawa said he wanted to build a relationship with the French carmaker that better reflected “Nissan’s will”.Prosecutors allege Ghosn under-reported his income by $44m (£34m) over five years. He denies allegations of financial misconduct, claiming he had no intention of making false reports, according to the public broadcaster NHK.Greg Kelly, a former representative director at Nissan who is suspected of masterminding the deception, also denies the allegations, saying Ghosn’s salary had been paid appropriately. Neither man has been charged.Under Japanese law, a suspect can be held without charge for up to 23 days.A spokesman for Nissan said its board had decided unanimously to end Ghosn’s 19-year reign as chairman last Thursday “based on the copious amount and compelling nature of the evidence of misconduct presented”.The Mitsubishi board comprises Ghosn, Masuko, two executives each from Nissan and Mitsubishi group companies, as well as two outside appointees – an academic and a writer.France’s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, has urged Nissan to “quickly” share its evidence against Ghosn, saying the latter would stay on as head of Renault “until there are tangible charges”.Le Maire added, however, that he did not believe “conspiracy theories” that Ghosn had been the victim of a “palace coup” to prevent him from merging Nissan and Renault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7825b376f4891197fcf7369ab4f61569ec875d4/0_847_6357_3815/master/6357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be3f95bde30aa44cf50d21b12f3ca1d","title":"deported rogue trader kweku adoboli first time free seven years home office ghana","story":"Kweku Adoboli has received a warm welcome in Ghana but badly misses his old life in UKWhen Kweku Adoboli’s Kenya Airways flight touched down at Accra’s Kotoka international airport he was so dazed and confused he barely noticed the tropical temperatures, the spectacular palm trees or the rich, red bauxite earth of the country of his birth.He had spent the first four hours of his flight from London Heathrow weeping about everything he had lost in the UK and the manner of his final parting from the country he had spent most of his life in.After seven years of fighting the Home Office’s plans to deport him, the end of the road was swift and brutal. He was not even allowed to say goodbye to his loved ones.Adoboli was arrested and detained two weeks ago, was deported two days later with no written notice from the Home Office about which flight he was going to board, and arrived back in Ghana, where he had not lived since the age of four, the following day.“They did a bait and switch on the tarmac at Heathrow,” he says. “They indicated I would be boarding one plane then at the very last moment they forced me on to another so I couldn’t alert friends and family to what was happening.”Adoboli moved to the UK at the age of 12 and boarded at Ackworth School, a Quaker establishment near Pontefract in West Yorkshire, before studying for a degree in computer science and management at Nottingham University.The former UBS trader was jailed for seven years in 2012 after being found guilty of fraud that cost the bank $2.3bn (£1.8bn). He was released after serving half his sentence.In Accra he received a warm and enthusiastic welcome not only from family and friends but from the wider community.“In Ghana the concept of restorative justice exists, something that seems absent in the UK. People here are saying to me: ‘We need your skills, let’s get you back into the community. It’s not right or fair the way you were treated in the UK. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves.’”He is staying with his father, John Adoboli, a retired diplomat, in a suburban neighbourhood in Tema, a thriving port city about 15 miles from the capital that is twinned with the London borough of Greenwich. In contrast to the often chilly and grey UK weather, temperatures rarely dip below 30C (86F) and most months Ghanaians enjoy more than 200 hours of sunshine.While Adoboli is at pains to emphasise his love for the country of his birth, for his family there and for the wider Ghanaian community, the UK has been his home for the past 26 years and he identifies with British culture and values.He has built up a wide support network in Britain, with a core of 25 close friends including his girlfriend, Alice Gray, his friends Pippa Scott and Roland Verhaaf and their two sons aged three and five. Adoboli lived with Scott and Verhaaf in Scotland for more than three years after being released from prison.“This is not about not liking Ghana,” he says of his seven-year battle against deportation. “It is about what has been taken away from me in the UK.”As well as his loyal friends, from school, university and other areas of his life, he is mourning no longer being able to enjoy the seasons. “I’m missing seeing the end of autumn and I won’t see the promise of spring,” he says.He left the UK with just a small rucksack he had packed when he went to report at a Home Office centre in Glasgow where he was arrested prior to deportation.“I don’t have much use for my waxed Barbour coat here,” he says. “It’s hanging in the wardrobe. I need to get some more T-shirts though.”Adoboli is not the only one who is distraught. Scott, Verhaaf and their children are feeling his absence keenly. Most of his belongings accumulated over 26 years of living in the UK remain in his bedroom in their home. The children do not understand why he is no longer there.“We told them Kweku is staying with his parents. The three-year-old said: ‘Oh OK let’s go and see him there then,’ and went to put on his shoes and coat,” says Scott.“Kweku doesn’t fit the materialistic banker stereotype,” she adds. “He has left behind lots of books, novels and classics, some clothes and his running shoes. Oh, and his toothbrush. On a whiteboard in the bedroom his notes about work he was doing on his Home Office and legal case are still there.”Their older child has started learning to read and every night reads the list of words given by school to practise down the phone to Adoboli.One item left in his old bedroom is a medal from the Queen he received after a three-day training session with UK and US special forces on counter-terrorism. He was one of several guest speakers along with Tony Blair and he travelled in a helicopter with the former prime minister.The event was organised through the Forward Institute, which promotes responsible leadership in business and society, which Adoboli has been working with. On the three-day development course he was asked to speak about learning from failure and risk-taking in highly complex situations. The medal and a bottle of whisky were his reward.Four days later, at the beginning of September, he was arrested and detained. The irony of one arm of the Home Office treating him royally while another detained and deported him is not lost on Adoboli and his friends.While he is still in a state of shock and grief about his removal from the UK and the forced separation from his loved ones, he is relieved to no longer be living under the yoke of the Home Office. “It’s the first time I have felt free in seven years,” he says. “The Home Office destroys lives. Destroys lives.”The Home Office said it did not comment on inidual cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f072837046fbb9535af537e1b3bebce3972068/0_0_1981_1189/master/1981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833b6d94a0ac4e57a6104ab4b4f76034","title":"margaret thatcher eligible scientist 50 note bank england","story":"Bank of England has received nearly 175,000 nominations in search for notable personMargaret Thatcher has been included on the Bank of England’s list of candidates who might be pictured on the new £50 note, which will celebrate the UK’s contribution to the field of science.In its public search for names to feature on the polymer note, the bank said it had received a total of 174,112 nominations, and the the former prime minister is on the list of some 800 eligible names published on Monday.The late Baroness Thatcher is likely to have been included among a field of scientists due to her early career as a research chemist, including a period working for the food company J Lyons on emulsifiers for ice-creams.It also comes after a campaign from the rightwing Guido Fawkes blog to “put Maggie on the new £50”, which was begun before the Bank said it was looking for a character from the field of science.Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, said this month that the choice for the £50 note would be limited to the UK’s contribution to science, prompting speculation that Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing or Stephen Hawking could be picked.“There is a wealth of iniduals whose work has shaped how we think about the world and who continue to inspire people today,” he said at the time.Alongside Thatcher are some other unusual appearances on the list of names published by the Bank. The comedy actor Will Hay, who was a successful amateur astronomer when not entertaining the public with classics such as Oh! Mr Porter, is on the list as is Roger Bannister, the first runner to achieve the four-minute mile, given his later career in medicine. He died in March.The Bank said first-stage nominees on the list had simply been deemed eligible: because they were real, deceased and had contributed to UK science in some way.

One big question around Black Friday and Cyber Monday that remains - is it actually making anybody any happier?A couple of days ago my colleague reported on whether the backlash against Black Friday had already started in the UK. Greenpeace is among a group of organisations promoting MAKE SMTHNG as an alternative to the consumer spending over this weekend. During it artists and crafters run workshops on ways to reuse, repair or recycle goods, rather than buying something new. There is some data too about how the Black Friday shopping experience makes people unhappy. HappyOrNot, the company that produce the little machines where you can register how happy you are with a consumer experience by pressing a range of smiley or not-smiley faces, measured 575,000 feedbacks from customers in places like Lidl, Zara, and Tesco. They claim that analysing the data shows that we’ve just lived through the unhappiest UK Black Friday they have on record.None of that today though - with Cyber Monday you can happily do it all from your phone of course. By the way, if you are struggling for Christmas inspiration, we have this year’s gift guide over here.And here are 12 ideas for gifts that keep giving throughout the year, by taking out a subscription service for someone. The jury is still out on whether having a smart speaker in your home is giving corporations undue surveillance in our private spaces, or whether all that worry is out-weighed by it just really being handy to be able to shout out “Hey, whatsisface, play my electronic surveillance playlist, ta”, or turn the lights off without getting off the sofa.If you are in the market for one, here are some options: This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Amidst the frenzy of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, there’s been a move in the US to try and get “Museum Sunday” to be a thing in the middle of it, where people promote more thoughtful activities than shopping. Although, obviously, getting people to part with their cash to attend attractions is still part of the agenda. It hasn’t particularly caught on in the UK yet, but there are some deals around on museums and attractions if you know where to look.A Merlin Annual Pass can get you into 32 UK attractions including Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, Alton Towers, Sea Life centres and Warwick Castle. They are offering three months for free, making it last 15 months, if you order during their Cyber week offer. It could make a great gift for a family - but there’s quite a bit of small print to note though, and lots of times when you might want to be taking the kids out, like August and Bank Holidays, are excluded from the major attractions.If there’s a transport nerd in your life, then the Black Friday sale at the London Transport Museum might be worth a visit - among the offers there’s a range of reproduction vintage posters down to half-price. Oh, and if you do want an educational angle on Black Friday, this article from the Museum of London about how a march on Parliament by suffragettes on 18 November 1910 came to be known as Black Friday due to the repeated assaults on the protesting women might make an antidote to the spending it has come to be associated with today.

Lee has become a fast hero of mine, although I only learned about her recently through Cathy Newman’s brilliant book, Bloody Brilliant Women: the Pioneers, Revolutionaries and Geniuses Your History Teacher Forgot to Mention.Lee, who was born in Scotland, was a Labour MP. She was the first minister for the arts, and is still the only person to table a white paper on the arts (A Policy for the Arts, 1965). She was instrumental in widening the remit of the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1967, particularly into the regions. Lee was so popular with theatregoers that she would be applauded by audiences whenever she went to see a show, which was often. (She was also involved in establishing The Open University and, a side note, was Nye Bevan’s wife: an absolute Labour power couple.)How we need a Jennie Lee for these philistine times. This month, Jeremy Wright, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS), gave us a surprising insight into his reading habits. He was unable to name a single female newspaper columnist when pressed five times (he eventually alighted on the Daily ’s Allison Pearson). He also said he does not subscribe to a single newspaper, but relies on aides to summarise their content for him. Of course, Wright is a busy man and pressed for time, but given that he is also responsible for “media ownership and mergers” and is also to lead a review into the future of journalism, it was an extraordinary admission. Wright also revealed his fondness for Lego. This was widely mocked, which was rather unfair. Because – and here’s the thing – at least it spoke of an actual interest. A real hobby outside of heckling on the green benches. Whether Lego falls under the category of culture is a different matter.Wright is just the latest in a long line of culture secretaries who appear to have no firm interest in any aspect of the brief. To be fair to the former incumbent, Jeremy Hunt, at least he is well known as a passionate lambada dancer, though he let himself down with his flakiness on BSkyB. We have now had three culture secretaries in just two years, such is the disregard for the office. Matt Hancock said he liked Ed Sheeran, and Karen Bradley apparently listened to Adele (the most mainstream, safest artists to pick, which smacks of focus groups). All several cultural isions below Jennie.Politicians are often seen as iniduals who go straight from university into the political arena, (sometimes via a brief stint in PR), and seem to have few other interests. They appear to read Hansard and little else. Jeremy Corbyn was slated for stating that Ulysses is his favourite book (people thought it pretentious), but at least it was evidence he reads for pleasure. Though he probably just read half of it, like the rest of us. One of the most excruciating mid-speech moments by David Cameron, was when he – an oft-professed fan of Aston Villa – forgot which club he ostensibly supported, and praised West Ham (who have similar club colours). Remember Gordon Brown saying his favourite band were Arctic Monkeys, who “really wake you up in the morning”, and then he couldn’t name a single one of their songs?The cultural deficit at the DCMS matters. The state of the arts in Britain does not make for good reading. The Arts Council England (ACE) budget for 2018 to 2022 has been cut by £156m. There seems to be no recognition of how powerful the arts can be in educating audiences, reflecting current events, exploring different views and opening up dialogue.In the past year alone, I have enjoyed Nicholas Hytner’s version of Julius Caesar at The Bridge, influenced by Trump’s America The Jungle’s tale of life in the Calais refugee camp Alan Bennett’s Allelujah!, a celebration of the NHS. In good news, the regions have gained support, but access is still often limited to a certain demographic: older, middle-class, affluent and white. As for sport, the 2012 Olympics were, agreed by almost everyone, a national success, but in London, grassroots sport has been cut by an average of £400,000 per borough, while youth crime increases.Lee argued that the arts should be accessible to every adult and child, ingrained in everyday life the education system local communities, almost as an extension of public health. The UK has much to be proud of in the arts – we are among the world leaders – but Lee’s vision has not come to pass, and if anything we are going backwards. Culture desperately needs a Lee, not a seemingly indifferent minister who, if recent history repeats itself, will be replaced in about a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498637530ad5cc8a189ea05a037e56fcb95382da/0_0_4500_2698/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a49aed94e39674a9f9024b443f00d926","title":"theresa may brexit deal meltdown","story":"Dark arts will be used to win support for the prime minister’s plan.

In her open letter to the nation, the prime minister declared that the agreement “is in our national interest – one that works for our whole country and all of our people … a deal for a brighter future”.But this is an ex-deal. The only reason it is sitting on its perch is because it has been nailed there.It is dead because – barring a truly dramatic realignment of parliamentary opinion – it simply cannot survive the “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons expected on 10 December.Julian Smith, the government chief whip – who looks like a dentist who positively enjoys giving his patients insufficient Novocaine – is now May’s most important cabinet colleague by far. In the next fortnight he and his team must use every conceivable inducement and threat to reach the magic total of 320 votes: knighthoods, peerages, gongs and legislative time will be offered to waverers. Those MPs who oppose the deal will be asked whether their families would really enjoy reading about their sexual indiscretions in the newspapers. Most of this nasty work will be carried out by intermediaries (even whips need plausible deniability). But any and every tactic available to the government will be used this is life and death, and no time for political squeamishness.But I still don’t see how Smith does it. Some MPs, strapped to the dentist’s chair, will indeed give in when he holds the drill in front of their eyes and asks: “Is your vote safe?” But I have yet to be convinced that he can get from around 260 (if you assume, generously, the support for the deal of 15 Labour rebels) to 320.What really matters, then, is not the first Commons vote, but the second. Let us assume that the PM is defeated next month: the political world is then plunged into an extraordinary Christmas crisis. May could, of course, force the issue with a confidence motion – or simply resign on the spot (unlikely, given her recent pattern of behaviour). Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, conceded to Marr that it was “not possible to rule out” the wholesale collapse of the government.The PM might yet, in any case, face the more parochial challenge of a Conservative vote of confidence, threatening her position as party leader: Jacob Rees-Mogg only has the names of 26 Tory MPs in his elegantly tailored pocket, but that could easily increase to the necessary 48 if May’s deal was rejected by the Commons.The EU would also have to consider its response. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, declared that “this is the best deal possible. This is the only deal possible.” The history of diplomacy suggests that most such statements contain a footnote written in invisible ink: “Unless we have to amend it a bit.” One can still imagine a few scraps being thrown May’s way to show good faith.But the fundamental controversies etched into the deal – the Irish border “backstop”, the continued role of the European court of justice, the prospect of the UK remaining indefinitely in the customs union – are not going to be removed by Brussels in a moment of shocked epiphany. Tweaks, maybe core alterations, absolutely not.Deplorably, senior government figures are actively hoping that the markets will respond with panic to the parliamentary failure of the deal, and, to adapt Dr Johnson, focus the minds of MPs sufficiently to deliver a majority second time round. The precedent cited in this context is the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) devised by George W Bush’s administration in 2008 to prop up the financial system after the crash. After its initial rejection by Congress, the US stock market fell by seven percentage points. Congress promptly endorsed the plan.But this is a ridiculous parallel to draw. The crash was a clear and present danger. The Brexit deal is simply a damn-fool plan drawn up in response to the result of a referendum involving lies, illegality and foreign interference. The crash could not be halted by popular will: fortunately, with Brexit there is precisely that option, in the form of a people’s vote.Expect the campaign for a fresh referendum to gather in strength after the parliamentary vote. Those who have always felt that a no-deal Brexit was the cleanest and most honest option – the oxymoronic “managed” no-deal of Dominic Raab’s fantasies – will shift up a gear. Within the cabinet, a new “gang of five” (Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clark and David Lidington) are reported by the Mail on Sunday to be ready to quit if a no-deal exit becomes a serious prospect.Even as May shook hands with Jean-Claude Juncker, the political village was transforming itself into a noisy constitutional souk. At every stall, the traders offer alternative models: “Norway for now!” “Canada ++!” “Switzerland!” “Get yer article 50 extension here!” None of these alternatives, it should be emphasised, has been seriously countenanced by the EU. But they are already being offered to curious MPs at early-bird prices.What unites this cacophonous marketplace is the absolute assumption that the deal will fail in December. The 585-page agreement and its 26-page political annex are already regarded as redundant. The variables are dizzying, the stakes vertiginous. The worst news that May has ever had to confront is that the past two-and-a-half years were the easy bit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49dd6fa233e13db5ea82ff9d8c3c39a937afb6c1/0_12_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6671ca813ed9d6a495fbfe3fa71542e8","title":"liberals politics emotion right wing populists","story":"Attachment to place and identity can be part of a radical democratic project that speaks to people’s heartsIn Europe, the United States and Brazil, authoritarian nationalism is sweeping to power through a mixture of negative emotion and elite connivance. But this is no mere re-run of the 1930s. In the first place, unlike in Germany, Italy and Spain at the incipient moments of their dictatorships, the existing elites neither want nor need fascism. Their problem is that they don’t know how to fight it.Over the past 15 years political science has engaged a well-evidenced but unfruitful debate over what caused the rise of parties such as Ukip, the Party for Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, or France’s Front National. In general, I think it is proven that cultural rather than economic insecurities are what’s driving politics to the right. But it does not follow from this that action at the economic level can’t stem the tide of plebeian racism. In order to get the actions right, though, we have to understand that the political narratives of the centre are failing due to the way the free-market economy was designed.Probably the best short definition of neoliberalism as a system rather than an ideology comes from the Goldsmiths University academic Will Davies, who calls it “the disenchantment of politics by economics”. By this, he means the introduction of market logic into all forms of social life by force, which has severely limited the scope for political choice.If I want to save Port Talbot steelworks, for instance, I cannot legally do so on grounds of national security, or preference for British goods, or sentiment, or because the town will die without the blast furnaces. I can only do so if I present a chop-logic argument that meets various national, European and global rules on trade and investment. If I just want to save it because I feel good driving past a giant piece of human ingenuity on the way to the surfing beach, the emotion is effectively blocked by the rules-based coercion states have signed up to.Another way of phrasing Davies’s definition, then, could be the evisceration of politics by economics, or more simply the surgical removal of emotional reasoning from political decision-making.At the most basic level – and this explains the rise of both the left and right opponents of neoliberalism – people understood that emotion, and with it feelings of identity, place, nation and class, could only reinsert itself into decision-making if the system were disrupted.A second driver of this emotion-driven revolt is what’s happened in the workplace. Neither political science nor economics has been very interested in the workplace as a political arena. Forty years ago, in my first factory job, I found myself in a permanent and highly educated political meeting it lasted from the morning tea break to the end of overtime. Comparing that time with this, two changes stand out.First, modern managements demand a high level of performativity, especially from the least powerful: employees are required to wish us a safe journey, or a nice day, or to upsell us Toblerones at the till. Second, work is far more explicitly coercive for those with low skills and low incomes than it was before the neoliberal era. The threat of the sack is not implicit it is in your face, daily. With it come the bullying, favouritism and sexual harassment cases that are the bread and butter of trade union activists. At the sharp end, in professions like taxi driving, truck driving, security and cleaning work, the threat of actual violence is often close. And in daily life, at the bottom end of the income scale, everybody knows someone involved in low-level organised crime.This has to be contributing to the strong but unacknowledged feelings of insecurity and frustration that pour out on the doorstep, once people have got over listing all the races and religions they would like to eradicate.The first lesson from this for liberal centrism, if it wishes to survive, is that it needs an emotional narrative with an inspirational core offer. And that core offer has to be economic hope: there is nothing that says the far left has to own policies of fiscal expansion, redistribution, state aid and high wages. It’s just that the neoliberal economic textbook says they can’t be done. The “fear of the future” reported in much qualitative research on supporters of the nationalist right is, for many of them, rational. People are reacting as if scared, depressed and angry because the world created by precarious employment, poor housing and rising inequality is scary, depressing and annoying.If you can’t answer the question: “How does life get rapidly better for me and my family?”, no amount of communicative power will help. Secondly, the centre has to make a strategic choice: to side with the left against the right. All discussions of populism that avoid that conclusion are worthless.If you Google the words Sajid Javid and fascism, you will see he has called Momentum, which I am a member of, a “neo-fascist group”. I can find no comment by Javid about the Whitehall rampage by up to 10,000 supporters of Tommy Robinson, among them actual sieg-heiling Nazis, in which they bricked and bottled the politan police. The duplicity and denial phase among centrists has to stop.Because I don’t think the crisis of democratic consent in the west will abate rather it will peak like a wave, and break in a series of national crises whose choreography is already predictable: a swing to the right by the CDU post-Merkel a run-off between Jean-Luc Mélenchon and Marine Le Pen in the next French presidential election a full-blown Matteo Salvini government in Italy a showdown between the Falange nostalgics in the Spanish elite and Catalan separatism Hungary and Poland sliding deeper into the grip of demagogues.In the face of that, the parties labelled “left populist” in the ’s “new populism” series are destined to play a decisive part in the resistance. They need to learn to fight intelligently, not run, as Alexis Tsipras did in Greece, headlong into the lights of the oncoming train. They need above all to learn to construct alliances – as Podemos and Barcelona en Comú are doing in Spain.If things get worse, we will all be grateful that the radical left has crafted a narrative of hope. At the battle of Jarama in 1937 at Suicide Hill, the men who marched into a hail of bullets to stop Franco taking Madrid were a mixture of British socialists, communists and former IRA men. If you read the memoirs of survivors, the common currency is hope for the future, pride in the act of resistance, and a belief in agency. Actively promoting such a conviction is one of the strongest weapons we possess against the soul-draining negativity of the authoritarian right.• Paul Mason is a writer and broadcaster on economics and social justice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6858658695d3239f67f3e97734c154ea9b3fc2b3/0_8_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d1d5ad2681ac8fbfeb2c84101c7e0e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sharp","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sharp’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sharp’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what sharp means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 28 November at 10am.

Is it mere happenstance, a case of nominal fortuity, or does it suggest a more sweeping reappraisal of masculinity and boyhood in this year’s films? Well, a little bit of both.To say Hollywood hasn’t always been interested in the particularities of men and their inner lives would be untrue. Were that so there might be a Netflix category for Films Starring Emotionally Constipated Men the way there’s one for Strong Female Leads. Alas, the former is something of a cinematic convention, the latter, unfortunately, still a subcategory deserving of special designation.Many film-makers – Sam Peckinpah, for instance – have made the study of the violent male id their cause célèbre. And from John Wayne to Humphrey Bogart to James Bond, movies have historically provided a blueprint (albeit, a single-minded one) for the performance of masculinity, so much so that Woody Allen’s character in Play it Again, Sam literally conjures Bogart’s ghost to seek his counsel on courting women. “I never met one who didn’t understand a slap in the mouth or a slug from a .45,” says a spectral Bogart.Suffice it to say that on-screen examinations of men and masculinity have tended toward hagiography, subtly and not-so-subtly reinforcing patriarchal notions about how to be a man. But as Hollywood itself belatedly reckons with toxic masculinity and the harmful, abusive ways it’s reared its head, more complicated portraits of men are upon us. There was last year’s Phantom Thread, nothing if not a critical study of corrosive male ego, and a succession of awards season juggernauts – Birdman, Boyhood, Moonlight – that could each be considered male coming-of-age stories, even as the age in question varies dramatically.Watching this year’s spate of movies, however, I couldn’t help but notice the ways they attempted, to varying degrees of success, to explore two particular kinds of topical masculinity that haven’t always been on screen: a youthful, unblemished one, in which adversity is sentimentalized, and a toxic one, in which pain works as a plot-stimulant, giving cause to our male protagonist’s destructive or selfish or emotionally repressed behavior.Take, for instance, First Man, which doesn’t lionize Neil Armstrong’s dogged race to the moon so much as it suggests the quest itself is a distraction from the death of his two-year old daughter and the monotony of suburban American life. Director Damien Chazelle has tended to venerate the monumental achievements of certain Great White Men, but it was something of a relief to see Armstrong’s daring and determination complicated, depicted for what it was: a hero’s journey, sure, but one motivated in large part by a culture that once forbade masculine displays of emotion, fragility and bereavement. First Man has been written off as nostalgic for that era, but it ought to be seen as more of an interrogation than an endorsement of it.Paul Dano’s superb Wildlife, too, examines the ways mid-century men dealt with wounded egos: Jake Gyllenhaal’s Jerry is so miffed after being fired from his job as a golf pro that he abandons his family to fight faraway wildfires. A past version of that same film might have considered that decision properly righteous, but here it’s seen as cowardly, a balm for the character’s pride. Make no mistake – First Man and Wildlife could hardly be more different. But in both films we find ourselves identifying with Neil and Jerry’s wives, played by Claire Foy and Carey Mulligan with the bewilderment of strong women who’ve wound up with men so spiritually and emotionally aloof. In both Gosling and Gyllenhaal, meanwhile, there’s a quiet, sad-eyed diffidence that gestures toward a new kind of leading man, or at least a new perspective on the ones of yesteryear.New kinds of leading men can be seen in two other films this year: Beautiful Boy, in which a father and son wrestle with the latter’s drug addiction, and Boy Erased, in which fundamentalist Christian parents send their teenage son Jared off to conversion therapy camp, later learning the cruel ignorance of their ways.Both films feature stellar performances from Timothée Chalamet and Lucas Hedges, respectively, but they render the pain of addiction and institutionalized bigotry in superficial ways, mostly as engines for parental enlightenment and filial devotion. David, father to Nick, struggling with an addiction to meth, can’t seem to wrap his head around the disease, not least because it doesn’t square with his notion of the kind of young man his son is: budding, beaming, beautiful. The film, though, is similarly incredulous, tethered to those same idealistic ideas of the handsome, white, and morally pure suburban son, replete with potential and unjustly afflicted with disease. Chalamet plays the part formidably, but the film suffers where it prescribes to the dogma instead of interrogating it, as if to ask how on earth this could happen instead of why.Jared’s pain in Boy Erased is of an entirely different sort, but it, too, is a film about the weight of society’s expectations of young men. Like Beautiful Boy, though, it doesn’t seem genuinely curious about those expectations beyond a simple straight-gay continuum. Mostly, it turns pain into polemic. But at its best moments – like one scene where Joel Edgerton’s conversion therapy drill sergeant has the boys lined up on a scale of least-to-most manly – the film asks tough questions about the cultural gradients of masculinity, the shades of which are often simplified on-screen.Seeing as “toxic” is Oxford Dictionary’s 2018 word of the year – its second most-frequent collocation is, of course, “toxic masculinity” – it makes sense that the year’s most thoughtful consideration of the subject can be found in Burning, the South Korean director Lee Chang-Dong’s psychological thriller that turns the love triangle of Jules and Jim on its head. It’s a film that’s honest, and strikingly literal, about the way men react to threats to their masculinity – with seething resentment, unspoken desire, and violence against women and each other. Like the hearings about Brett Kavanaugh’s alleged abuse did, it captures the harm and erasure enacted upon women caught in the throes of masculine one upmanship.It makes strange sense, then, that Robert Redford’s delectable turn in The Old Man \u0026amp the Gun is supposedly his final role. David Lowery’s film, in its relish for Redford’s waspish looks and smooth, movie-star charm, is itself a kind of swan song for a bygone version of the American man, solitary, sandy-blond and square-jawed. That’s not to say we won’t see more of them on screen. Invariably, we’ll always have superheroes in dex, astronauts and boxers and stickup men, the Redfords and the Bogarts, brandishing their .45s. Glaring discrepancies remain in the opportunities afforded women in film versus men, in front of and behind the camera. But as the industry begins to slowly redress those imbalances and call time’s up on toxic men more generally, it’s becoming more nuanced and inquisitive about the ways those men, and boys, are depicted on-screen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1918078651a63c376ffba8a6eef46f9d5de2349f/119_281_6936_4162/master/6936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a67a613f74a68932ab1750ea97d626","title":"thomasina miers recipe for crisp turkish duck leg","story":"This aromatic, spice-rubbed duck goes beautifully with the bitter-sweet flavours of radicchio, pomegranate and quinceDuck meat has always felt luxurious but, as I discovered at a recent Suffolk food festival, it needn’t be a luxury: you can buy duck legs for very little.

He was left on the bench throughout Arsenal’s win at Bournemouth, not even emerging to warm up during the second half as Unai Emery – in his own words – “decided for other options” and while he will at least be fresh for the almost-dead Europa League rubber against Vorskla Poltava he would presumably have had other things in mind when signing his new contract in February. Özil’s best work this season has come when fielded atNo 10, a role that was unavailable in the 3-4-3 Emery deployed on Sunday, and the head coach may have seen enough to extend the experiment. “We are finding our best performance with the system, with the players and with the combination,” Emery said, in a clear acknowledgingment that Arsenal are still looking for a balance that satisfies him despite their unbeaten run stretching to 17 games. Nobody would doubt Özil’s ability to unlock a defence but Emery’s demand for a better blend between attack and defence may leave his prospects uncertain. Nick Ames• Match report: Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal• Bournemouth too ‘demanding’ for dropped Özil, says Emery• Nick Ames: Emery’s tough tactics bear fruitMaurizio Sarri had been warning for weeks that it would come to this if lessons were not learned. That those slow starts would eventually punish Chelsea. “Now the problem is evident and I hope, first of all, to the players,” he grumbled, pointing to slackness in possession, a lack of urgency throughout the lineup, and an inability “to stay compact”. The players, of whom five fronted up to the media post-match and admitted standards had slipped, understandably called for a little perspective given this was a first defeat in 19 competitive matches under Sarri, and even suggested the loss was timely, but could offer no real explanation to the plodding openings. “It’s good for us to understand, to remind us that the Premier League is never easy,” said David Luiz. “Nobody is happy. But the coach has been many times angrier when we’ve won. It’s true.” Sarri has been demanding improvement since day one, and defeat will have stung. The squad may see a different side to the Italian at Cobham on Monday. Dominic Fifield• Match report: Tottenham 3-1 Chelsea• Dominic Fifield: Alli stifles Jorginho to put Chelsea’s title hopes on hold• Hazard again suggests he may leave Chelsea in the summerAs he headed for the tunnel after 28 minutes, sent off after two moments of madness, James Maddison bowed his head in shame. He knew he had made a mistake, committed one of the most inexcusable crimes on a football pitch: ing. But, an ounce of credit to the Leicester midfielder for not going into hiding. Long before his embarrassing fall in the box was magnified on Match of the Day, the 22-year-old came out to confront the deserved criticism. “Nobody wants to see ing in our beautiful game,” he posted on Instagram. “I was anticipating contact that never came, but that’s no excuse. I will learn from it.” Maddison’s naivety took Leicester’s red-card tally to four this season, twice as many as any other side. Under Claude Puel, nine players have been sent off in 33 matches. “We have to manage better our attitude and our games,” Puel said. Ben FisherThe respect between Claudio Ranieri and Ryan Sessegnon was mutual after Fulham kickstarted their campaign with a pulsating victory over Southampton. From the player’s perspective, it has been heartening to see Ranieri waste no time making his presence felt after replacing Slavisa Jokanovic. “He wants us to defend as a team,” Sessegnon said. “Very tactical – more tactical with this guy than the last one. He’s really set down the way he wants to play.” Fulham have been vulnerable all season and Ranieri’s main focus is on tightening the worst defence in the league. The Italian is less concerned about his attack and praised Sessegnon for a vibrant display after seeing the 18-year-old winger create goals for Aleksandar Mitrovic and André Schürrle. “He’s one of the best young players that I’ve met,” Ranieri said. “He’s young, a child. It’s not easy for him, but I’m very pleased with his performance.” Jacob Steinberg• Match report: Fulham 3-2 Southampton• Soares critical of Southampton’s mental frailty in Fulham defeatCardiff made Everton work surprisingly hard for their win at Goodison, though Neil Warnock accepts he is going to have to spend money in January to give the club any chance of survival. “We will need to go shopping, I feel we will have to bring in a bit more quality to stay up,” the Cardiff manager said. “It is not easy to find players in January but two or three new players could improve the squad and give us a fighting chance. At the moment we have a right-back playing up front. He’s doing very well, but we need to be better.” Callum Paterson, the right-back in question, got himself in a great position to open the scoring in the first half, only to miss the target. A quality striker, or indeed any sort of recognised striker, might have put his side in front and increased the pressure on the home side. No one could fault the burly Paterson’s commitment or workrate, but his finishing possibly leaves something to be desired. Cardiff can still save themselves if they maximise their points return at home, but they are unlikely to do it with a right-back operating up front. Paul WilsonLiverpool are now 13 games unbeaten in the Premier League this season, with a record points tally for this stage of the season. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson have both been integral throughout thanks to their energetic attacking and defensive sturdiness, summed up by their efforts at Vicarage Road. The England right-back Alexander-Arnold whipped a free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards at a crucial point in the match to make it 2-0, showcasing another of his talents. Flying down either flank, he and Robertson instigated all of Liverpool’s counterattacking verve, a crucial aspect in tricky away games and one Watford could not cope with. As well as his superb attacking displays, in Robertson’s 12 league appearances this season Liverpool have kept eight clean sheets and he boasts five assists, more than any of his teammates, helping them to second in the table. Will UnwinAs a test of where West Ham are this season, how far they might have progressed under Manuel Pellegrini, the mauling by Manchester City revealed little to those watching from the stands. But for the Chilean there was much to take from it. His claims that West Ham were as dangerous as their opponents seemed thin (City could and would surely have scored more had they felt it necessary), but he had a broader point that was more convincing. In sticking at it, Pellegrini said, his team had shown “the mentality to play in the same way against every team”. If West Ham want to be a big team, they will have to impose their style on other teams consistently, regardless of the opponent. This has not always been the case in recent seasons. With eight matches before they face a top-six opponent again, West Ham now have the chance to prove Pellegrini’s theory on the pitch. Paul MacInnesThe headlines inevitably belonged to Aaron Mooy, but another man in the beating heart of the Huddersfield midfield was arguably the best player on the pitch at Molineux. Philip Billing again excelled, alongside Mooy and Jonathan Hogg, with the 22-year-old’s superb goal-line intervention keeping Raúl Jiménez at bay and a silky flick for the overlapping Florent Hadergjonaj showing both sides of his game they were contrasting moments, but both characteristic of another exuberant and mature display. Billing eats up ground, is unforgiving in the challenge but, perhaps most importantly, he possesses the guile to make a difference in both boxes. He was equally influential in the crucial victory at home to Fulham earlier this month and, as Huddersfield stretched their mini-unbeaten run to three matches, the great Dane put on another classy show. “He has grown,” his manager, David Wagner, said recently. “He has become a man.” Ben FisherYou could say this about a few teams at the moment, but Saturday’s win over Chelsea marked the start of a crucial few weeks in Tottenham’s season. On Wednesday they face Inter in the Champions League, then comes the north London derby at Arsenal, a couple of slightly more gentle league games against Leicester and Southampton before a trip to Barcelona. They realistically have to win both of those European games to progress and of course a victory at the Emirates is non-negotiable, but it’s not just the win over Chelsea that will provide encouragement, more the nature of it.

While supporters are planning their itineraries to avoid the Christmas shopping, agents for the Premier League’s out-of-contract players will be hard at work attempting to secure their clients’ futures for next season and beyond.Fifa rules state that players with less than six months remaining on their contracts are free to negotiate with overseas clubs and sign a pre-contract agreement to join at the end of the season.It could be a particularly busy few weeks ahead at Manchester United, where up to 10 first-team players are out of contract in June including David de Gea, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera. United have the option of extending the Spain goalkeeper’s contract by another year, as they do with Anthony Martial, Andreas Pereira, Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Matteo Darmian, although they have yet to confirm whether any of those will be taken up. Talks over new deals for Mata and Herrera are understood to have started, while Ashley Young has been offered a one-year extension.Arsenal, having seen Alexis Sánchez join United last January having entered the final six months of his contract, are set to lose another first-team star after they withdrew an offer to extend the stay of Aaron Ramsey. The Wales international has indicated he will be leaving at the end of the season and he could begin negotiations with clubs outside England on 1 January, while Danny Welbeck’s future is also up in the air following his serious ankle injury. Nacho Monreal, Petr Cech and Stephan Lichtsteiner are the three other players whose contracts expires in June, with only Monreal having opened talks about an extension.Elsewhere, Chelsea also have plenty of decisions to make with the contracts of seven first-team players close to expiring. A new deal has reportedly been offered to David Luiz and preliminary talks have started with Olivier Giroud but the future of Cesc Fàbregas appears less certain given that he has hardly featured in Maurizio Sarri’s Premier League XI and the club captain Gary Cahill looks set to leave, initially on loan in January.It’s a similar story at Tottenham, who are almost certain to exercise options to keep the defensive duo of Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen but could decide to allow Mousa Dembélé, Fernando Llorente and Michel Vorm to leave having yet to reach agreement on new deals.Manchester City face a fight to keep the Spain Under-21 forward Brahim Díaz after Real Madrid were rumoured to have shown an interest in the teenager, while the £42m defender Eliaquim Mangala and club captain Vincent Kompany are in the final year of their deals. The Liverpool trio Daniel Sturridge, Alberto Moreno and Lazar Markovic are also sweating on their futures, with only Sturridge expected to be in with a chance of earning an extended stay.Cardiff have six players who are entering the final six months of their contracts, including the impressive Kadeem Harris and Danish striker Kenneth Zohore, while several of Leicester’s 2016 title-winning side, including the captain Wes Morgan, Shinji Okazaki, Danny Simpson and Christian Fuchs, also face a nervous wait over their futures.West Ham supporters will anxiously note the presence of Declan Rice on the list below, with the 19-year-old yet to sign improved terms to his deal worth £3,000 a week despite stating last week that he wants to stay.

Skinner’s side have made a steady rise into third place, putting them in an excellent position to challenge for Champions League qualification, and their latest victory underlined their efficiency. Even though injuries deprived them of Ellen White and Rachel Williams, Birmingham showed that they know how to keep going. Skinner has been in the job for almost two years, allowing him to create a sense of continuity, and it is impressive to see how everyone in the squad knows what to do in every situation. That sets them apart from a lot of their rivals. There is a real sense of tactical awareness – good luck creating chances against them – and Birmingham are even starting to improve in front of goal, scoring five in their past two games. It just goes to show the value of long-term consistency. There are no huge names the team is the star.There is no doubt that Arsenal have found the right way to play with Vivianne Miedema. Last season she struggled to set the league alight after impressing for the Netherlands at the European Championship, but maybe that was because she was being played out of position. That’s changed with Joe Montemurro in charge. Arsenal’s manager is using Miedema as a poacher and the Dutch striker has gone to another level, hitting 14 goals for the runaway leaders. Her movement in the box is brilliant. It’s casual, casual, casual – and then comes that dynamic burst. She goes past a defender with a two-yard check and it helps that Montemurro has made sure to surround her with creative players who can get the ball into dangerous areas. With Miedema in this form, stopping Arsenal will be incredibly difficult. Yes, they briefly looked human against Brighton – but they still won 4-1 after conceding first.• Arsenal 4-1 Brighton – as it happenedManchester City know they are going to have to produce a faultless performance to stand any chance of beating Arsenal on Sunday. Although they are back in second place after seeing off Yeovil, who put up a good fight until fading late on to go down 4-0, they will be concerned by their wastefulness in front of goal. Nikita Parris, second in the goalscoring charts to Miedema after her 10th of the season, has to become even more ruthless. Nice play simply won’t be enough against a side as forceful and unforgiving as Arsenal. Arsenal will be nine points clear if they leave Manchester with a win, whereas City will spy a chance to close the gap given their opponents will be without Kim Little and Jordan Nobbs. But while City are still unbeaten, it is debatable whether they have evolved enough. Arsenal are playing much better football, with pace and dynamism, and are blowing teams away with a scintillating tempo. That should give them the edge as they chase their 10th consecutive win.The clock is ticking for Everton after two goals from their former striker Brooke Chaplen saw them lose 2-1 to Reading. The league’s bottom side urgently need to find a new manager before crucial games against Liverpool and Bristol City, the position having been vacant since Andy Spencer’s sacking. The squad is strong enough to be doing better but they have to stop conceding so many cheap goals. Having chatted to people at the club last week, I thought it would already have been done. Yet the longer this goes on, the less chance they will have of staying up. The transfer window opens soon and they have to give a new manager time to make changes.After missing loads of chances against Birmingham last week, West Ham got back to winning way after finding a cutting edge against Bristol City. Alisha Lehmann and Jane Ross, two key signings, got the goals for Matt Beard’s side, who are doing well in their first season as a new outfit. West Ham deserved the win. The statistics were strongly in their favour and this is a worrying period for Bristol City. They raised a few eyebrows with draws against Chelsea and City in September, but they have won one and lost three of their last four games.• BT Sport has coverage of FA Women’s Super League all season.

And we’re absolutely on track to do that.”She also announced that  News and Media, as part of its commitment to a erse workforce, would carry out an audit of employee pay by ethnicity during the next 12 months, in order to ensure the organisation treats iniduals fairly.Viner used her speech to highlight the ’s commitment to investigative reporting on topics such as the Windrush scandal and Cambridge Analytica, while calling for news organisations to collaborate more and commit to in-depth reporting.“Too many important stories get ‘drive-by’ coverage, when what they deserve after the big moment is patient attention, forensic reporting which reveals injustice, or gives a voice to the silenced.

What impact is this having on our lives, and what can be done to prevent it? We want to hear your thoughtsIs the internet really destroying our high streets?Increasingly, the convenience and cheapness of online retailers like Amazon is cannibalising independent firms and high street retailers. Many buyers skip the trip into town, or go there to assess the product and then buy it cheaper from the comfort of their sofa. As global capitalism continues its seemingly unstoppable growth, many wonder if we have reached “peak stuff”, thanks to years of high consumption. The switch to online shopping, combined with a slowdown in spending and rising costs from business rates and wages, has battered the profit margins of many retailers. There is also a major shift underway in how consumers spend their leisure time, too – more often choosing to spend their spare cash on holidays and experiences rather than in shopping malls, and increasingly opting to entertain, dine and drink at home. Meanwhile, businesses such as beauty salons, barbers and health clubs are on the ascent, since their services cannot be replicated online, and for many countries there has been a massive surge in vaping shops, coffee houses, and ice cream parlours.The growth in e-commerce is often cited as the main reason well-known retailers are struggling. But is taxing online firms the whole solution? After it was raised in the UK’s budget, the British high street momentarily looked set for rehabilitation. But 2018 has seen more closures across the country. Pubs, fashion outlets and estate agents are prominent among 24,205 closures recorded in the first six months of this year in the UK alone, and the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty has soared by more than 4,400. And that’s just in Britain.Every year, the crisis faced by huge numbers of shops and businesses costs tens of thousands of jobs across Europe and the US. Major chains have collapsed into administration this year while many others have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills. Beyond retail, many towns are having to fight to save their local library, pub, nursery or community centre – the places that have always fulfilled a social function as well as a commercial one.Yet, amid all this, it is easy to forget that, globally, the vast majority of sales – at least four-fifths – are still made in stores, as e-commerce giants have noted. The two worlds are still in the process of converging, so what might this mean for our communities, and is there hope yet of a resurgence?We want to examine the effects of these retail shift on the lives of people across the world, and how it is impacting economies, democracies, and families. How are local businesses coping or adapting? And workers with specialist skills? How is the ‘warehouse culture’ affecting rates of job satisfaction and the welfare of iniduals? And importantly, what action can we take to help slow or even reverse the onward march of e-commerce giants, or at least make them only a part of the picture. We at the  have covered how York’s Bishy road has cultivated the creation of what urban planners call ‘a sticky street’, where ‘time spent’ and enjoyment factor are the key aims of retailers, and we’ve explored how the ‘experience economy’ of a high street without actual shops could work. Our reporters have gone to areas like Bristol and Liverpool where local currencies have been trialled as a means of keeping profits in the neighbourhood. And we continue to examine whether taxing online retailers is the most effective thing that can be done to ease the situation.The debate is ongoing, and we want to hear from you, wherever you are in the world, for this month’s podcast.

I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the . So please: come, try and (I hope) enjoy what we have to offer, but do also pile in with feedback and ideas.If you give us just 20 minutes of your time, we promise you will learn something relevant, interesting and new every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/293f50c0db66a63507873cba201249dc46707ca9/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=690ff674e713349974224208526f4236","title":"is big pharma ignoring the poor","story":"Pharmaceutical companies are driven by profit.

I personally know colleagues who have been let down by the government’s actions and have been forced to leave despite having contributed so much over the years.”The data shows that there was a marked increase between 2016 and 2017, and that the numbers of EU leavers in 2018 appears to have dropped back to just below 2016 levels, but it is too early to draw conclusions as the data for this year is incomplete.Meanwhile, data compiled by the Office of National Statistics show that Brexit is having a significant impact on the wider jobs market. The number of EU nationals working in the UK fell by 132,000 to 2.25 million between the third quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2018.The trend is driving job vacancies in the UK to a record high, with an estimated 845,000 unfilled positions. Employers warn that it is getting harder for firms to hire qualified staff.Green MP Caroline Lucas, who acts as a spokesperson for Best of Britain, argued the figures “demonstrate the scale of damage already being wrought by Brexit”, and blamed Theresa May for not acting quickly enough to guarantee the rights for EU citizens living in the UK.Citizens rights have been bound up in the EU negotiations, which May is trying to bring to a conclusion, but it took a year after the referendum before the prime minister said EU citizens in the UK would definitely be able to achieve settled status by applying for leave to remain.Last week May told the CBI that EU citizens would no longer be able to “jump the queue” when the UK sets its own immigration policy after the conclusion of the Brexit transition period, which is currently due to end in 2020 but may be extended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fbf141bf1a3604721a4f82d43b40e427faf0f4d/0_193_5749_3448/master/5749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9f508d9aa52419853ee40fce6a2fdd","title":"labour argues for article 50 extension if brexit deal voted down","story":"Keir Starmer says Theresa May and EU27 could extend talks if UK ends up with no dealThe government and the EU could be persuaded to extend the Brexit process if Theresa May’s deal is voted down by MPs, Labour has argued, as ministers begin the task of trying to sell the agreement to the country.Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said May had “run down the clock” with her Brexit talks, meaning that to renegotiate a better permanent deal would probably require article 50 to be extended beyond March next year.If the only alternative was the chaos of no deal, then May and the EU27 would back down and allow this, Starmer argued.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long.

Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.However, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was sent out to extol the merits of the deal agreed in Brussels on Sunday, said that if MPs voted down the deal “we go into uncharted waters”. “This is the best deal, and it’s also the only deal, and EU leaders have made that clear,” he said.May was expected to make the same point in a statement to parliament later on Monday, warning MPs that failing to back the deal would take Britain “back to square one”.Barclay conceded it would be difficult to get the deal through parliament, but said the cabinet needed to make the case, for it.“I don’t pretend for a minute it’s not a challenging task given where the numbers currently look,” he told Sky News. “But this is a good deal that respects the referendum result.“And we need to be clear with parliamentary colleagues as to what the alternative will be, which will be massive uncertainty from either no deal or no Brexit. That’s not in the interests of their constituents or in the interests of protecting jobs. It gives uncertainty to EU citizens in areas like the NHS.”Starmer dismissed that forecast, saying Labour’s main concern was with the vagueness of the agreement on a future relationship.“It is a problem, and it’s a problem the prime minister has really got us into, because over the two years she has effectively run down the clock,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We had a snap general election at the beginning of the exercise, which wasted the first few months. We had months and months and months of waiting for Chequers. The frustration in Brussels during that time was: ‘We don’t really know what you’re asking us for’. We only got Chequers in June and here we are.“And to be honest, all the stuff about extended transition, all the stuff about backstop, that’s insurance policies because the future arrangements, the future relationship, is not nailed down because that bit hasn’t been really negotiated over the past two years. That’s a massive failure.”If the deal was voted down, Starmer said it would probably take political pressure from MPs to avoid the alternative of a no deal, and the agreement of the EU to extend article 50.“If you had a vast majority saying we don’t authorise the government to leave with no deal, it would be very difficult politically to do so. I accept that might not be legally binding,” he said.“I accept that stopping no deal is something that’s going to have to involve the whole of the EU, but I think there would be a very strong push by the majority in parliament against no deal. And I don’t think this prime minister would simply plough on regardless, because she knows how dangerous no deal is.”The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspSome reports have said May plans to challenge Jeremy Corbyn to a TV debate on the merits of her deal, something the Labour leader has agreed to do. Barclay told Sky he could not confirm it.Asked why May planned to send herself and ministers around the UK to sell the deal, when it was MPs who would decide, Barclay said: “MPs themselves gave this decision to the public, MPs voted to have a referendum, to give the public a say. So it’s quite right that we take our case to the public. It was their vote.”Speaking later on Today, Barclay dismissed fears the UK could be endlessly stuck in backstop arrangements over issues such as fishing, which has been raised as a concern by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.“It’s not in the EU’s interests for their own trade negotiations, because one of the key points when you’re negotiating trade is to be clear on the size of the market, and you couldn’t do that if it was unclear if the UK was in or out.”Barclay said he hoped to be able to sell the deal to fellow Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs: “It’s a deal for Brexiteers like me which delivers on key things we campaigned for. It allows a skills-based immigration system, it allows an independent coastal state, so we have control of our fishing, we control of our money, border and laws.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b91da2528deff62f3ef11b9373cdf71835a4b306/0_2_2952_1771/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a6d3254c0915d6ca88d4565ed4f61fe","title":"brexit may commons statement economy would be 4 smaller after 10 years under mays brexit plan says report politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s statement to MPs about yesterday’s EU Brexit summitMichael Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, is famous for saying in the 2016 referendum campaign that that people “have had enough of experts” (although the full quote was a bit more nuanced). So it is welcome to see that he has given a speech today headlined: “No such thing as too much information”.It was about climate change. And this is how it started:And there is perhaps no area of public policy where scientific rigour is required in shaping policy making than in dealing with the challenge of climate change.Gove was speaking at the launch of the UK Climate Projections 2018 report, the first major update of climate projections in nearly 10 years. Here is a Press Association story summarising what the report says.Heatwaves and rising sea levels of more than a metre could threaten the UK in the coming decades without action to cut greenhouse gases, experts have said. Summer temperatures could soar to 5.4C higher than current levels by 2070, while winters could be up to 4.2C warmer if fossil fuel pollution stays high, the new UK climate projections from the Met Office show. By mid century, summers as hot as this year’s weeks-long heatwave will be the norm, the researchers said. Sea levels affecting London, where the Thames Barrier is expected to be in use to protect the city until 2070, could rise by up to 1.15 metres by 2100 if climate-warming emissions continue to climb. Even if emissions are cut in line with the Paris climate agreement to curb temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, sea levels could still be 29cm to 70cm higher in the capital by 2100. Cardiff is expected to have similar sea level rises as London, while in Edinburgh seas could rise by as much 49cm with low emissions and up to 90cm with high emissions. In Belfast, seas could be as much as 52cm higher with low emissions and up to 94cm by the end of the century with high levels of climate pollution. Even if the world manages to curb emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement, the projections show the UK’s average yearly temperature could be up to 2.3C higher by 2100. I’m just off to the lobby briefing now. I will post again after 2pm.And here are three of the most interesting charts from the report.This one shows what has happened to UK GDP and inflation since the referendum, relative to other G7 economies.And this one shows the NIESR’s assessment of by how much government borrowing would have to increase under various options. Under May’s plan, it would be 2.6 percentage points higher, the NIESR says.And here is an extract from the report explaining this effect.Labour is opposed to Theresa May’s Brexit deal. But the SDLP, its sister party in Northern Ireland, is in favour. Speaking at Stormont, after Northern Ireland’s pro-remain parties (Sinn Fein, the SDLP, the Alliance and the Green party), held a meeting with business leaders, the SDLP’s leader Colum Eastwood said:We don’t think there is a good Brexit but if we are going to have one, let’s try and limit the damage to our communities and our businesses and our society here, that’s what the backstop does, we need to bank that backstop, it is our ultimate insurance policy. I would appeal to people across the water who have a vote in two weeks’ time, particularly people in the Labour party who have a very keen interest in supporting our peace process and all the political progress we have had over the last 20 years, this is an opportunity to once again step in and protect the progress that you were involved in helping bring about. It is absolutely essential and we are all saying it, we are saying it as a collective political majority, we are saying it as a civic society from across all the different sectors, and our communities are saying it as well, we need your help, we need your protection, we need you to vote for this deal.This is from ’s Christopher Hope.One of the more controversial issues in British politics in the run-up to the 2010 general election was identity cards. Tony Blair was in favour, and his government passed an Identity Cards Act, but under their new leader, David Cameron, the Conservatives were going through a libertarian phase, they opposed ID cards strongly, the scheme never really got rolled out, and when the coalition government came to power, it repealed the Act with glee.But today George Osborne, chancellor in that government and Cameron’s closest political ally, says he thinks his party may have got it wrong. As editor of the Evening Standard he sometimes writes an “editor’s reply” column in his paper and today he has used it to reply to a letter from Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who chairs parliament’s intelligence and security committee. Osborne says:Theresa May has started to advance the argument that MPs should vote for her Brexit deal in part because people are fed up of this whole process and just want their politicians to move on.In a good Twitter thread, starting here, David Henig, the trade expert and former civil servant who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project explains why this hope is forlorn. A visit to the UK by Shinzo Abe, the Japanese premier who was touted as a key figure in Theresa May’s plans, has been postponed as the prime minister begins a whirlwind few weeks of selling her Brexit agreement to the country.Senior Whitehall sources told the  that the Japanese prime minister was now expected to visit in January, instead of during the tumultuous few days before the meaningful vote in the House of Commons.They suggested the delay was a result of May needing to focus all her attention on winning over sceptical MPs, rather than visiting heads of state. However, Abe is also under pressure domestically to be in Japan while their parliament is sitting, rather than spending yet more time abroad. One said: The Japanese PM’s visit has been postponed, rather than cancelled. It works very well for both of them to delay the visit until the new year. The prime minister has her hands full ahead of the Brexit vote and Abe needs to spend some time at home, especially as he has been out of the country a lot recently.It emerged that Downing Street expected Abe to be a key figure in May’s plan to sell her Brexit strategy after a PR plan, featuring endorsements from world leaders and an interview with Theresa May by David Dimbleby, was leaked earlier this month. No 10 insisted the “communications grid” did not reflect its thinking.The Japanese prime minister has said his country would welcome Britain into the trans-pacific trade deal with “open arms” after Brexit. He said last month that while Britain would lose its role as a gateway to the EU after leaving, it would still be a country “equipped with global strength”.The TPP is an agreement between 11 counties, including Vietnam, Canada, Australia and Japan. It did include the United States, but Donald Trump withdrew from the agreement last year.Labour sources are saying there could be as much as five days of Brexit debate in the run up to the meaningful final vote on or around December 12 a long run just before the next European Union summit on the 13th and 14th. That could be the moment for a defeated Theresa May to try one last time for a better deal from Europe, although the prime minister has repeatedly said that the deal on offer is the only one she will be able to get.The growing expectation at Westminster is that the government will struggle to impose the voting system it wants as May does not appear to have the numbers to force through her own procedure via a business motion. That would mean that amendments would be voted upon before MPs determined the main motion on whether to approve May’s final deal.Labour believes that the speaker would select only a handful of amendments for debate: one from its party outlining its alternative Brexit plan, one from the SNP, and presumably a backbench amendment on a second referendum that is expected to be put down by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston.What is not clear is if there would also be an amendment from the hard Brexit European Research Group or the Democratic Unionist party.Under the EU Withdrawal Act the prime minister has to notify parliament when she has reached a withdrawal agreement with the EU. Today Theresa May has issued that notice, in the form of a written statement.Cyprus has been bemoaning the prospect of the UK leaving the EU. The former colony features in the withdrawal agreement signed off by the EU yesterday as Britain has two sovereign base areas on the island. Speaking to the , Cyprus’s government spokesman, Prodromos Prodomou, said: It would be preferable from our point of view if Britain could remain in the Union, but it’s not our call and we don’t want to make any judgement of Britain.But regarding the military bases – 99 square miles of overseas territory retained by Britain when the Eastern Mediterranean island won independence in 1960 - Prodromou added that he thought the agreement was “fair.” He said:The business department, which among other things is in charge of government policy towards labour markets, is facing strike action by workers over pay and conditions. The PCS union has today announced that it has issued a strike notice to the department on behalf of support staff - such as security guards, cleaners, reception staff and caterers - whose jobs are outsourced to a contractor. The PCS, which wants the jobs brought back in-house, is demanding better pay and conditions and has not been satisfied by Greg Clark, the business secretary, saying he will hold a review.Another union, the United Voices of the World Union, is also balloting support staff at the Ministry of Justice over strike action. In a press notice the PCS said:In both workplaces, BEIS and MoJ, workers have been out-sourced to subcontractors who pay them below the independently-calculated London living wage (£10.55 an hour) and only the statutory levels of sick pay and leave. That means that workers are forced to work when sick or injured as they cannot afford to miss a day. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, which is pushing for a harder Brexit, told LBC during his regular phone-in this morning that the country should not be “frightened” of making more preparations for a no deal Brexit.Referring to a Mail on Sunday story saying the Brexiter environment secretary Michael Gove was persuaded to back Theresa May’s Brexit plan because he has been briefed that a no deal Brexit could leave the UK short of chemicals essential for water purification, Rees-Mogg said:These scare stories are absurd. We are not going to run out of clean drinking water. We managed to have clean drinking water long before a very large number of continental European countries, it is something we have been quite good at since the 19th century. We are going to get more of these scare stories but we need to make preparations, particularly to alleviate any problems around the Dover-Calais route.The Commons often does not sit on Fridays, and when it does, MPs debate private members’ bills, meaning they can choose to be absent.But, according to the Labour whips, the Commons will be sitting regularly on Fridays in the new year, when the government may need to pass a flurry of Brexit legislation.So, at least Brexit is going to be good for productivity in one area of national life ....There’s much irritation in Scotland this morning at the French president, with one headline reading “Macron picks a fight with Scottish fishermen”. This comes after Emmanuel Macron suggested at a press conference on Sunday that he would use the “leverage” of keeping the UK in the customs union to get a good deal on fishing access for French fishermen.Speaking on BBC’s Good Morning Scotland, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford warned that “the EU are making clear that fishing is going to be a bargaining counter.” He said:But the chief executive of the Scottish Fisherman’s Federation, Bertie Armstrong, who has consistently offered qualified support to May’s deal, down-played the row, saying on the same programme: The public need to recognise, first, that the fishing industry will fight tooth and nail for a decent outcome and, two, nothing has yet been given away, so everything so everything is to play for. We’re not buying any of these stories, neither Mr Macron’s or even the prime minister’s, until such time as it is signed sealed and delivered.The government and the EU could be persuaded to extend the Brexit process if Theresa May’s deal is voted down by MPs, Labour has argued, as ministers begin the task of trying to sell the agreement to the country. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said this morning May had “run down the clock” with her Brexit talks, meaning that to renegotiate a better permanent deal would probably require article 50 to be extended beyond March next year. If the only alternative was the chaos of no deal, then May and the EU27 would back down and allow this, Starmer argued.The research was commissioned by People’s Vote, which is campaigning for a second referendum, but produced by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR), an independent and respected economic thinktank.The full report is being launched later, but here is the key NIESR conclusion.Here is an extract from the People’s Vote news release (bold type from the original.)Although the proposed UK deal envisages no tariffs or quantitative restrictions, the UK would not enjoy Norway’s full access to the EU’s single market through the European economic area or Switzerland’s comprehensive regulatory alignment through bilateral agreements that allow free movement of labour.By 2030, at the end of the first decade outside the EU, this would have the following consequences: The report underlines how continued uncertainty from the proposed deal’s lack of clarity about the UK relationship with the EU or the rest of the world means “business investment and economic activity is likely to continue to be even lower”. But, because it is impossible to forecast accurately the scale of this damage compared to staying in the EU, no figure is given for it and this study is therefore likely to be a conservative estimate of Brexit’s final cost.And here is a chart from the report with the key figures.Brexiters, of course, will dismiss this as nonsense, and it is true to say that the precise figures in long-term economic forecasts are almost inevitably bound to be inaccurate. But that does not mean that they cannot provide a reliable guide to long-term economic trends. To use an analogy popular with economists, if you eat pizza for lunch every day for the next 10 years, it is impossible to be certain what you will end up weighing, but you can be sure that it will be more than if you ate salad. The NIESR is the first expert body to produce an economic impact assessment of the specific deal on the table, but its assumptions and calculations are very much in line with those of mainstream economists, including the government’s, as became apparent when the government released details of its provisional Brexit modelling in March.The government is expected to publish its own analysis of the impact of the deal later this week, possibly on Wednesday.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives a speech on climate change at the launch of the the UK Climate Projections 2018, the first major update of climate projections in nearly 10 years.10am: The inquest opens into the death of the Welsh assembly politician Carl Sargeant.10.30am: Theresa May chairs an unusual Monday cabinet which will discuss Brexit. (Normally cabinet meets on Tuesdays.)12pm: The People’s Vote campaign launches a report from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) looking at the economic impact of May’s Brexit deal. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, Pat McFadden, the Labour former minister, and Anna Soubry, the Tory former minister, will be among the speakers.After 3.30pm: May makes a statement to MPs about yesterday’s EU Brexit summit.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

It followed “toxic”, picked for the same honor by Oxford Dictionaries, and “single-use”, picked by Collins.Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said the choice of “mis” over “dis” was deliberate, intended to serve as a “call to action” to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits.The Oakland-based company wanted to highlight the idea of intent to mislead, and that misinformation can be spread unwittingly.“The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018,” Solomon said. “Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact.”In studying lookups on the site, Dictionary noticed “our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again”, Solomon said.For example, the word “mainstream” spiked in January as the term “mainstream media”, or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult on the political right. There was a surge in February for “white lie”, after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for Donald Trump.The word “Orwellian” surfaced in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, accused the Chinese government of “Orwellian nonsense”.Misinformation, Solomon said, “frames what we’ve all been through in the last 12 months”. The site, which has 90 million monthly users, has added entries for “filter bubble”, “fake news”, “post-fact”, “post-truth” and “homophily”, among others. Other entries have been freshened to reflect new meanings, including “echo chamber”.The company’s runners-up include “representation”, driven by the popularity of the movies Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians and wins in the US midterm elections for female, Muslim, Native American and LGBT candidates.But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond US borders. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said.“Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional,” Solomon said.“Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It’s sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, ‘THIS is disinformation.’ With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation.“It’s a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation.”In 2016, Dictionary chose “complicit” as its word of the year. In 2016, it was “xenophobia”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65e303566a0dfe0c602f1a9b5e6910488d211bc/0_184_5370_3222/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eab637a0b80cc0aadfcde949983b1bf","title":"prehistoric remains mammoth tusks woolly rhino","story":"Digging alongside the bulldozers of the £1.5bn road ersion, archaeologists have discovered tonnes of ancient bones. Is there a find so important that it could stop the whole project?A small crowd of workers gathers outside a temporary office plonked in a muddy field in Cambridgeshire. Bill Boismier flips down the back door of his pickup truck and reaches inside. Earlier this morning, the American-born archaeologist, who has steeped himself in British soil for more than 40 years, was up to his knees in a nearby pit to retrieve the find he is now unwrapping. “What is it?” asks a site cleaner who, like everyone else here, is dressed head-to-toe in hi-vis safety gear. “Is it … a dinosaur?”“Not quite,” Boismier, who is 65, tells the group. His grey ponytail is tied back with a rubber band and his face reveals a life spent outdoors. “But it is an ancient species. It could be more than 130,000 years old.” The leg bone, still caked in mud and roughly the height and weight of a five-year-old child, belonged to a woolly mammoth. The elephant-sized beast once roamed the land that is now just south of the Fenstanton Travelodge, at junction 27 of the A14.The mammoth bone is the freshest find at Britain’s biggest current road-building site. Archaeologists predicted that the £1.5bn project to ert the A14 around Huntingdon, just north of Cambridge, would be fruitful dig up 12.5 miles of Fenland for a new motorway and you can expect to find some things. But the hordes of archaeologists who have worked ahead of – and alongside – the bulldozers have been astonished to document the treasure beneath their feet.Boismier jumps in another truck with Dai Davies, a burly Welsh earth mover, for the short drive to borrow pit 3. Rather than truck thousands of tonnes of gravel and earth across the country for the project, which also includes the widening of a further 10 miles of the existing A14 and A1, several temporary quarries, or “borrow pits”, have been dug in neighbouring fields. It was in the third of these that, in October, one of Davies’s digger operators struck palaeontological gold.At the far end of the pit, Boismier and Davies step out of their truck to join Steve Sherlock, a Yorkshire-born ground sleuth who oversees the archaeological work. Such is its scale – and the strict planning requirements attached to it – that Sherlock, 64, has had to coordinate some 250 archaeologists. Before work began in 2016, research including hi-tech geophysical surveys identified sites for detailed excavation. Sherlock’s teams have uncovered whole medieval and Anglo-Saxon villages, as well as an ornate 8th-century comb made of deer antler, dozens of Roman brooches and a bone flute.But meticulously excavating sites as large as borrow pit 3 using pick-hammers and trowels would make large projects impossible to achieve. The quarry, which Davies manages, is a small cog in a giant roadbuilding machine, yet it is an awesome sight. Giant industrial pumps at the perimeter work day and night to keep the water table at bay as more than a dozen machines excavate and move earth in a kind of digger ballet. It is a scene of temporary mass destruction (the pits will be returned to fields afterwards) but the men and women behind the controls at this site have a dual role.“He’s looking at the moment for a different colour when he’s digging,” Davies says as he points at the nearest digger. Before its driver sinks his bucket into the ground to pull up more than three tonnes of earth, he draws its toothed edge carefully over the surface. A darkening in the earth might indicate the presence of something significant, and the need for a more detailed look. While digging like this last month, Davies’s team created national headlines. They found a pair of mammoth tusks and, rarer still, the intact skull of a woolly rhino. “You tell people down the pub you’ve found a mammoth tusk and they say ‘no you haven’t’ and you have to show them a picture,” Davies says in a Welsh lilt. “It’s not something you encounter every day, is it?”For Sherlock and Boismier, the intended benefits of the road project, which Highways England hopes will improve traffic flow between East Anglia and the Midlands, are secondary to the opportunity it presents. There would be no other reason, in the fairly featureless Fens, to dig giant holes to a depth of four metres. Yet there is no other way to peel back so many layers of history.Boismier tries to conjure the landscape here when the mammoths and rhinos roamed, centuries before humans changed it all. He describes a fast-flowing, icy river – which left the gravel now incorporated in the new roads – sweeping away all but the heaviest remains of animals. There were no trees and much of England was bound by glaciers and ice sheets. “You see some of the greyish blue clay there,” Boismier says, pointing at giant clumps of earth pulled from the deepest pits, below the gravel. “The dinosaurs were alive when that was deposited.”But undertaking this kind of archaeology is often fraught: a race against the machines. Sherlock, who has worked on road projects since 2003, is the middle man. He works for Highways England and has managed 33 excavation sites while also working with dozens of contractors who are, among other things, building more than 30 new bridges, each of which requires deep foundations. “If an architect says to a contractor, ‘Oh, that won’t take long,’ the contractor thinks they’ll go off and have a cup of tea and it’ll be done,” he explains. “But ‘not long’ for an architect might be two weeks.”Boismier, who exudes a seen-it-all wryness, is positive about the cooperation on his latest project. Yet he blanches when asked what might happen if one of Davies’s diggers hit a dinosaur. “I’ll go home and not come back,” he says, laughing. He wouldn’t, of course, but it’s clear that the odd mammoth tusk or rhino skull, while rare and remarkable, is about as excitable as the team here wants to get. “This is a watching brief,” Boismier adds. “You’re going around with the works to try and get things recorded, not trying to disrupt, and then moving on.”What would it take, in terms of archaeological significance, to really throw a project as big as this off course? “Oh you’d have to find the Neanderthal man with a mammoth footprint right on him,” Boismier says. “But that’s not going to happen.” The woolly rhino skull will do nicely. It and the woolly mammoth went extinct more than 10,000 years ago and the rhino skulls have a honeycomb structure that means they rarely survive intact. “To get a complete one is just amazing,” Boismier says. “At first we didn’t know what it was.”Hanging over Sherlock, Boismier and Davies (who deserve their own sitcom, by the way) is a major deadline. A previous version of this project first hit drawing boards in 2005, only to be axed by the government in 2010 because of its enormous cost. The current scheme won approval in May 2016 and is due to be completed in December 2020. Mola Headland Infrastructure (MHI), a joint venture including Museum of London Archaeology, got the contract to do the archaeology.Even recruiting the archaeologists has been a challenge they are in short supply, Sherlock says. Last summer, MHI had to scoop-up archaeology graduates by the dozen and put them on an eight-week training course. The call went out globally, and almost three-quarters of the team has been foreign. At one point, Sherlock got in a team of 20 from Rome. “And they were digging Roman sites of course, some of the time,” he says.Yet managing the living has been a logistical cinch compared with the mammoth task of dealing with the dead. The team has pulled up more than seven tonnes of bone, including some human remains, and about the same weight in pottery alone. What do you do with all that stuff? When Davies’s digger operator found the tusks and skull, he brushed them off and set them aside, pausing only for minutes before climbing back into his machine. The next time Boismier was at the borrow pit, he retrieved them, bagged them in plastic and took them to a large MHI field centre in nearby St Neots. All the finds, including those from the archaeological digs where the team has more time to work, have been processed there and loaded into large plastic boxes before being trucked down the A1 to Mola’s HQ.The large grey building is wedged between a self-storage centre and a Royal Mail sorting office in east London. A few days after Davies proudly surveyed his borrow pit, Liz Goodman, a conservator at MHI, is standing over a large table in a harshly lit workshop. She wears blue latex gloves. The mammoth tusks sit next to the skull, bits of mud and gravel still sticking to them, and water pooling on the plastic sheeting. It’s like a scene from CSI Ice Age, except that Goodman’s headache is not to establish a cause of death but to work out how to stop the finds disintegrating. Mammoth ivory is layered up as cones within cones. The tusks have been saturated in wet earth for thousands of years. Drying them out would cause the layers to separate. “They would just sort of slowly explode,” Goodman says.A find like this in Britain is so rare that Goodman is having to research her options. The crates the team has to store items in water aren’t big enough. Plastic bags doused with water work for now, but water alone would also eventually threaten the ivory, its high surface tension effectively pulling it apart over time. “We’re going to substitute water for alcohol because its surface tension is much less, but the quantities of alcohol you need get quite interesting,” Goodman says.Mola is also having to draw up security measures for the tusks. Bans on trading elephant ivory have, over the years, created a market for the mammoth alternative, typically using tusks pulled in greater numbers from Siberia. “I’m suddenly realising all these new things I need to worry about,” says Goodman, who is used to dealing with smaller fragments. She has not yet opened the box that contains Boismier’s mammoth leg.Upstairs, specialists are processing some of the artefacts retrieved from the A14 project. Lyn Blackmore is excited about the unusually ornate comb. It’s stored in foam in a small box, and came from a lost Anglo-Saxon village Sherlock’s team excavated near Brampton, a village on the route of the Huntingdon bypass. “I’ve never seen one so fancy,” she says of the 8th- or 9th-century object. Most of its fine teeth are still attached to a beautifully carved handle.A few desks across the large open-plan office, Rachel Cubitt is looking at an x-ray of a number of Roman brooches from another excavation site. It reveals the fine spring one of them contained for fastening a cloak. In another brooch, coloured enamel decoration is still visible. “We’re used to projects in London, but large parts of this area of England have never been touched, archaeologically,” she says. “This is a fantastic opportunity to understand large swathes of the countryside.”Back on the project, the bulk of the detailed excavation has now been completed. But at the borrow pit, Davies is optimistic that he may yet discover more big bones. For him, working with Boismier and Sherlock has been eye-opening. He has a new-found respect for archaeologists, having observed them up to their neck in mud on winter days that would make a woolly rhino to shiver. “I’ve also seen things on this project I don’t think I’ll ever see again,” Davies says, revelling in a new interest in history. “I was in Cambridge the other day and I’ve nearly gone into the archaeology museum,” he says, laughing. “They’ve nearly broken me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

That was my goal, my dream,” says Ana Carrasco, the first woman to become a world champion motorbike rider. She won the World Supersport 300 title in dramatic style in September when, having led the championship for much of the season, her history-making feat was only confirmed on the last lap of the final race at Magny-Cours in France.“I am also a woman,” Carrasco says pointedly on a quiet afternoon in Getafe, on the outskirts of Madrid, when she is asked about the wider impact of becoming world champion. “So it is important to show everyone that a woman can be just as good as a man. It’s also important there can be more women riding in the world championship in a few years. This was a big moment for me – and for women in the sport.”The 21-year-old, who comes from Murcia in southern Spain, is softly-spoken and intelligent. It is easy to imagine her one day becoming the lawyer she plans to be, with Carrasco currently in the second year of her part-time law degree, as she discusses her hard road as a female rider.Carrasco has ridden professionally since she was 16, even though she only had her expenses paid rather than receiving a wage for the first three years. In her understated way she points out that male riders also struggle at the outset of their careers. But they do not suffer the isolation Carrasco experienced when she joined the Moto3 world championship, two tiers below MotoGP, in 2013.“The first year was really difficult,” she remembers. “The riders were not ready to have a woman on the grid. They didn’t want to help me so it was very hard. But by the middle of the season I won my first points and they could start to see I was fast.”Did any of the men say anything demeaning to her? “No, never,” Carrasco says. “You could just tell what they thought. They didn’t want to look at me and I had to do everything alone. I had to find the line on my own. New tracks, new bike and it was so hard. Normally a young rider will find an older rider who will let him follow so he can learn the line. I had to learn how to be fast alone.”Carrasco found ways of subverting the status quo. In 2014, in Assen, rather than being shielded from the sun by an umbrella held by a smiling grid girl before the race, she was accompanied by a young man whose muscled torso was bare. Carrasco sat next to him with her helmet on and visor up, impassive and ready to race.“My team was from Holland and they wanted to say something different,” she explains. “I was happy. I said: ‘They have grid girls – why can’t I have a grid guy?’ So for one race it happened and we showed people women don’t just have to be grid girls. They can race too.”Life was financially challenging. “I was racing for free,” and Carrasco says. “They paid all my expenses, my travel, but I didn’t get any pay.”In 2017 she made a bold decision to switch to the new Supersport 300 World Championship. She immediately looked at home on a Kawasaki Ninja 300 – and began to be paid. “I am now riding near the top so it’s possible to have good rewards. Supersport 300 was a good opportunity but it is very competitive and actually a more difficult category than Moto 3. You have to race almost perfect because if you make a mistake you end up at the back.”In September 2017, Carrasco’s career changed forever when she made her first slice of sporting history. She became the first woman to win a world championship motorcycle race when, with exquisite timing, she slipstreamed the two leading riders in the championship and overtook them with seconds left in Portugal. It was brilliant racing as she found a draft on the final stretch to zip past Alfonso Coppola and Marc García.Before then was she doubted because she is a woman? “For sure. There are problems being a woman in this sport. My problem was that people did not believe I could win. I said many times I was good enough but it’s difficult for some to believe it. After Portugal many people accepted it.”Carrasco was 22 points clear but a change in the regulations affected her bike and she struggled. “We had to put 40 kilos on the bike. So at the start of the championship I had a very good bike but after the change I had a bike that would make the top 15 – nothing more. In the last four races we didn’t have a good set-up.”Deroue was leading until he retired on the sixth lap. Carrasco’s only rival for the title then was Mika Pérez. “The board told me if Mika won I had to finish 10th.”Carrasco had climbed to 13th but with Pérez leading on the last lap it looked as if he would become world champion. But Supersport 300 is intensely competitive and Dani Valle’s Yamaha sped past Pérez on the inside. Valle held his line through the final chicane and Pérez finished second with Carrasco 13th. She had become world champion by a single point.“After the race I was just waiting for someone to tell me if I had won. I saw all the photographers at turn five and I knew one of them. I said: ‘Did I win?’ He said: ‘Yeah, yeah, stop here!’ That was the moment I knew. I was crying for sure, with big emotion.” Did it live up to her dream of becoming world champion? “Yeah, and more,” Carrasco says with a smile. “It was way more than I expected. After this my life changed.”Carrasco has been praised by Marc Márquez and Jonathan Rea who this season again became, respectively, MotoGP and Superbike world champions. “I know Marc from Moto3. I have a good relationship with him and with Rea now. Rea helped me and told me some things to help me win the championship. It is important the best riders think I have talent.”Will the physical demands of MotoGP be her hardest challenge? “The bike is more powerful in Moto GP and I will need to work on my physique. It’s the same if I go to 600cc. But with a trainer you can prepare yourself to be stronger. The young Márquez that rode a 125 is not the same Márquez now. You have to prepare for MotoGP.”Carrasco dedicated her world title to a young Spaniard who will never fulfil his potential. Luis Salom, the 24-year-old Moto2 rider, died during practice for the Catalunya Grand Prix in 2016. “We were good friends since 2013 when I started in Moto3. So when he died I made this promise to myself. If I ever win the world championship I will dedicate it to him because he fight too much to be a rider. His mother called me the day I won and I will see her in Majorca at Christmas. She is happy we remember Luis.”Carrasco believes the days of silent discrimination are over. Even a breakthrough into MotoGP will surely not be blocked just because she is a woman. “I will have the opportunity now,” Carrasco stresses.She smiles when asked if she can sense a changed attitude on the grid. “After winning the title I think they have even more respect for me – not because I’m a woman but because everyone respects the world champion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7ec68e678e4d02a87621cd8dc3738b4b47a16d6/121_67_2511_1507/master/2511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b37f568dc3de0765cc3f03df172cfe78","title":"andy farrell joe schmidt ireland coach rugby union","story":"For the Rugby Football Union every syllable of the press release announcing Andy Farrell as Ireland’s next head coach will sting indefinitely. Had England not crashed out of their home Rugby World Cup in the 2015 pool stages, Farrell would probably still be at Twickenham and modern rugby history might look very different. Talk about sliding doors.In retrospect Eddie Jones’s decision not to retain Stuart Lancaster’s erstwhile assistant when he had the chance in December 2015 will go down among the more generous Anglo-Irish gifts on record. By the time Jones tried to woo back the former Great Britain rugby league skipper earlier this year, it was too late. In company with Joe Schmidt, Farrell has helped construct the most formidable Ireland squad of all time, as reflected in their clean sweep at this year’s World Rugby awards.And why not? Everywhere he has played and coached, Farrell has been a winner far more often than not. He was captaining Great Britain at rugby league at 21, scored over 3,000 points in 370 games for Wigan, was the youngest player ever to taste victory in a Challenge Cup final at 17 years 11 months and became only the second British player, after Ellery Hanley, to be crowned world player of the year. As the defence coach on the last two British and Irish Lions tours, he has yet to lose a series.Players, not least in Ireland, love him for two main reasons. Firstly, he has walked the walk, which always commands respect. Perhaps even more significantly he speaks their language. It is years ago now that a vastly experienced former national head coach told me the recently retired Farrell was an absolute natural in terms of simple and effective communication. When he talks players listen and, more often than not, make a mental note never to let him down.His famous “We are taking them boys to the hurt arena” speech before the third Lions Test in Sydney in 2013 is just one example of the uncompromising Wigan attitude drummed into him from the moment he made his debut aged 16 against Keighley. “It was definitely fear-driven,” he once told me. “You knew you were going to get it on Monday if you’d made a mistake. From day one you learned to know your job and to work as hard as you possibly could.”He has also come a long way from his days as an apprentice joiner “on £30 a week” for Wigan Council but, from the age of 21, he knew he wanted to be a head coach. He had seen how Wigan’s Graham Lowe and John Monie operated and had plenty of his own ideas too. “I wrote stuff down from all the coaches I’ve had in my career. I suppose that’s the type of player I was. I was never an inidual player, I was always a team player. I was always a captain. It was always about how teams gelled together. I was fortunate as a player that I loved training, watching videos. I don’t see it as work, I see it as a pleasure.”He also had a short spell under Jones at Saracens and, as befits a man who once won rugby league’s Man of Steel and Golden Boot awards in the same year, has never been a one-trick pony. “Andy was a warrior who led from the front and took no prisoners but he was a great tactician as well,” recalled Phil Larder, the man who appointed him Great Britain captain. Pressure does not faze Farrell when you have had to run for your life pursued by an angry crowd in Papua New Guinea, as he did in 1996, the Aviva Stadium is child’s play. “We were chased around the field with sticks. We had to try to jump on a minibus, to get away at the end. The minibus was backed up to the gates, the gates opened and we all had to pile on. People were hitting the side of it and we were saying: ‘Go, go, go!’”With Irish heritage on both his and his wife’s side of the family – one of his brothers, Phil, represented Ireland at rugby league in 2003 – he has hinted he feels more at home in Dublin than he ever did at Twickenham. Given his son Owen is now leading England, however, the Farrell effect is now a multinational phenomenon. The rugby world will be fascinated to see what unfolds when Ireland host England on the first weekend of the 2019 Six Nations championship but in the Farrell household – “He’s a professional, I’m a professional. You do your job, don’t you?” – it will be business as usual. Anyone hoping Ireland will be a softer touch without Schmidt is doomed to disappointment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1cfcdfc2aeaef943f7f12ddc0fc2ed7341db60a/11_60_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2ac90e2e8092d88de6175cf2e7ff0f","title":"rfu accounts reveal loss and redundancy of 54 staff members","story":"The Rugby Football Union has predicted “growing uncertainty” and “challenging times” after its annual accounts revealed a £30.9m loss and the forced redundancy of 54 staff members.Speaking on Monday, chief executive, Steve Brown, insisted he was leaving his post, having announced he was doing so earlier this month, for his “own reasons” and not because the RFU is in bad financial shape.“I think the RFU is in a superb place and is in great shape to adapt to whatever comes in the years ahead,” he said. But Brown did admit the organisation needs to “pull back a bit” in terms of future investment and make “adjustments”.The reason for this was spelled out by RFU chairman, Andy Cosslett, in his introduction to the 2017-18 financial statement. After seven years of revenue growth in a “buoyant market”, Cosslett explained, the “situation is changing and market conditions have been getting tougher”.Cosslett did not mention Brexit but he did say the overall financial outlook was uncertain and the sports rights market was tightening. But he also suggested that the RFU had overpaid when it signed a £200m, eight-year agreement with the professional clubs to compensate them for international call-ups.“We have to accept we signed some long-term commitments with the professional game which, while strategically important, now appear costly against updated revenue forecasts ... they will reduce our discretionary investment going forward,” wrote Cosslett."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa484b4c9e7d85263fd1d71d7318645756d9fded/35_45_2490_1494/master/2490.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ea4b8942a1f8233e067c06dfe62f0d4","title":"rugby union talking points autumn internationals","story":"Ireland have much to thank Schmidt for, Italy bear the brunt of All Blacks’ frustrations and Fiji look ominous foes for AustraliaEngland’s autumn ledger reads as follows: P4 W3 L1 tries scored 10, tries conceded six. They have looked both excellent and sluggish at times but the overall end-of-term report has to be a positive one. If the Vunipolas return fit and firing, Manu Tuilagi and Joe Cokanasiga stay intact and Owen Farrell adjusts his tackle technique, they will be tough, at the very least, to beat in 2019. The Six Nations already has the makings of a wonderful tournament, with England’s opening fixture against Ireland in Dublin a potential humdinger. If the Harlequins’ trio of Chris Robshaw, Danny Care and Mike Brown make it back into the starting XV for that fixture it will be some achievement England, with Farrell at the helm, are increasingly entering a new phase. Australia? The Wallabies are currently a pale shadow of the World Cup winning sides of old. Watching their forwards on Saturday was like going snorkelling on the Great Barrier Reef, ing under the water and discovering almost all the coral has died. Robert KitsonA year ago, Guy Novès was sacked as France’s head coach after a draw with Japan so his successor Jacques Brunel will have had a fitful night’s sleep after Fiji recorded a 21-14 victory – their first over Les Bleus in nine attempts. More than half Fiji’s players and all their points scorers at the Stade de France earn their livings in the Top 14 and they maintained their focus after a strong start having failed to do so earlier in the month at Murrayfield. France were virtually at full strength but failed to score a point in the second half after leading 14-12 at the break. Fiji, who lost to a late penalty in Dublin a year ago, are in the same World Cup group as Wales and Australia – just what the wavering Wallabies could do without. Paul ReesIreland have much to thank Joe Schmidt for following the news that the 2019 Rugby World Cup will mark an ending to his hugely successful reign as their coach. But perhaps one of his greatest gifts to the side could be the farsightedness of offering a berth to a disgruntled Andy Farrell after England could not find a place for him on their coaching staff. Farrell will now take over from Schmidt to provide Ireland with the sort of continuity that the All Blacks have and which other teams crave. Only time will tell whether Schmidt’s decision “to finish coaching and prioritise family commitments” is a fudge to reduce speculation on whether he secretly harbours ambitions for the New Zealand job – if or when it becomes available. Tom BryantJohnny Sexton was crowned World Rugby Player of the Year on Sunday on a night of sweeping success for Ireland.\u0026nbspJoe Schmidt scooped the coach of the year award, with Ireland named team of the year in a triple win for the 2018 Six Nations Grand Slam winners at the World Rugby Awards.\u0026nbspBritish and Irish Lions fly-half Sexton has become the first northern hemisphere winner of World Rugby\u0027s top accolade since France\u0027s Thierry Dusautoir in 2011.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s been an incredible year for Irish rugby, to win everything we could, really, Sexton said.\u0026nbspTeams try to peak for World Cup years. People ask have we peaked too soon? Well we haven\u0027t peaked, so we\u0027re just getting better and hopefully we can continue to do that. You have to improve ahead of the general curve. We know everyone else is going to get better. We\u0027ve got to deal with being favourites and I\u0027m sure we can do that.Sexton\u0027s stunning drop-goal on the 41st phase of the final play secured Ireland a 15-13 win over France in Paris, as Schmidt\u0027s men set the ball rolling on just their third-ever Grand Slam.\u0026nbspThe lynchpin playmaker also guided Leinster to the PRO14-Champions Cup double, before starring when Ireland toppled back-to-back world champions New Zealand 16-9 in Dublin earlier this month. PAHell hath no fury like the All Blacks scorned as far as Italy are concerned. On Saturday New Zealand ran in 10 tries in Rome in a 66-3 victory – Jordie Barrett helping himself to four from the wing – to take the frustrations of last weekend’s defeat by Ireland out on Conor O’Shea’s side. Two years ago, it was also Italy who faced New Zealand a week after they had been beaten by Ireland in Chicago and that day the All Blacks also scored 10 tries. On Saturday, the All Blacks were far from flawless and the gloom that surrounded the Dublin defeat has not been lifted entirely but at least a long season has been signed off with a bit of style and Steve Hansen can beginning plotting how to bring about necessary improvements for next year’s World Cup. Gerard MeagherWales is supposed to be the breeding ground for fly-halfs. Now they have very definitely usurped England as a factory for flankers. Especially the kind the game still likes to refer to as “opensides”. There may be only 10 scrums per game these days, but if you like your flankers fast, hard and skilful, Wales is the place to look for them. Ellis Jenkins is the latest to wow in a red shirt, not that he’s the latest to emerge from the Principality. He ran through the gamut of skills of a flanker, which means the skills of a rugby player. Alas, his injury near the end looked serious. All the same – if he’ll forgive us – there are plenty more where he comes from. Michael AylwinThe Red Roses might be behind France in the Women’s Six Nations pecking order but they are a long way ahead of the rest. England will be handing out 28 15-a-side contracts in January and have enviable strength in depth. The obvious candidates will be rewarded – Katy Daley-Mclean, Sarah Hunter, Marlie Packer, Abbie Scott and Lydia Thompson, whose second-half hat-trick of tries sank a young Irish side that included a 16-year-old schoolgirl. But the newer faces, the Saracens pair, tighthead Hannah Botterman and the 20-year-old fly-half Zoe Harrison, have also impressed this autumn along with Zoe Aldcroft, an athletic lock from Yorkshire who is thriving under the tutelage of England’s new forwards coach Richard Blaze. Everything in the red rose garden may not be perfect – and it has to be said that the standard of place-kicking from both sides was lamentable on Saturday evening – but Simon Middleton’s England are progressing nicely.

Play resumes today at the College in Holborn after with the best-of-12-games match deadlocked at 5½-all following 11 draws in as many contests. Sixteen days and no blood drawn: the longest streak of games to open a match without a decisive result in the recognized 132-year history of world championship play. But the tension will never be higher than today, where a decisive result would lift the winner over the 6½-point threshold and determine an outright winner in the €1m ($1.14m) showdown.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1.

A brief recap on how we got here: Game 1 was a grueling seven-hour, 115-move staredown, where Carlsen nearly become the first defending champion to win the opening game of a world championship as black in 37 years. The next four contests – Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 and Game 5 – were mostly safer, straightforward affairs that allowed Caruana to get his teeth in the match. The tension ramped up in Game 6 when Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending. They played to another draw in Game 7, a result that left the champion lamenting his gun-shy play as white. In Game 8, Carlsen found himself down nearly an hour on the clock facing a dangerous position as black, until one false step by the American allowed him to hold. It was Caruana’s turn to suffer in Wednesday’s Game 9 until he was bailed out by a Carlsen inaccuracy. Then came Thursday’s Game 10, where Caruana found himself on the brink once more until Carlsen overextended himself and was made to grovel for a peaceful result. Saturday’s Game 11 fizzled out practically before liftoff, ending in a simple two-and-a-quarter-hour draw.Eleven games. Eleven draws. Will the staredown finally end today? We’ll soon find out when Caruana makes the first move at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Saturday’s Game 11.Carlsen, as white, played into Caruana’s Petroff with an opening line that paralleled their August meeting at the Sinquefield Cup, which ended in a draw. The American challenger and world No 2 was first to deviate, castling on the kingside (7. O-O) instead of the Nc6 he’d played in St Louis.A briefly promising double-edge position took shape with (8. Qd2 Nd7 9. O-O-O Nf6 10. Bd3 c5), but Carlsen expended 23 minutes on his next two moves (11. Rhe1 Be6 12. Kb1 Qa5) and admitted he’d been thrown for a curve once more by Caruana’s exhaustively researched opening preparation and not for the first time during the fortnight. Eventually the champion offered up a queen exchange with 13. c4 and the ladies were off the board (13. ... Qxd2 14. Bxd2), abruptly stripping the tension from the affair.“I wasn’t pleased from the opening and then after that I just wanted to play it safe,” Carlsen said. “I was trying to push a little bit, but it’s nothing real. In this match situation I thought there was no reason to go crazy.”The action soon entered an opposite-colored bishop endgame which Caruana held with no problems before consenting to a 55-move draw after two hours and 13 minutes, the shortest game of the match so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453dabd10daacf0333010af69c833b35d099f462/0_145_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d507af4e26c786da94b8bee2184e7d1","title":"darbar festival review akram khan sadlers wells london","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonCurated by Khan, this celebration of classical Indian music dips into dance forms boasting symmetry, balance and beauty Hands and faces are two sorely underused body parts in western dance, often an afterthought to acrobatic limbs. But in Indian classical dance they’re where the action is at. Epic stories unfold in the narrowing of eyes, raising of brows, the pursing or curling of lips, and the intricate arrangements of fingers.The eight Indian classical dance forms have been around for a couple of thousand years, way longer than ballet, but it’s rare to see them on a major stage in pure form, rather than contemporary fusion. Akram Khan (one proponent of such fusion) has curated this event, exploring three dance forms, bharatanatyam, kathak and odissi, part of the Darbar festival of classical Indian music.For the uninitiated, classical art forms can feel impenetrable, but they share a sense of symmetry, proportion, balance and beauty that seems to be universal across cultures. Certainly bharatanatyam, originating in Tamil Nadu, is a dance of clarity. Its wide open angles snap between poses so swiftly you barely see the limbs travel. In the storytelling, there is a specificity to the gestures (mudras) even if you don’t know their inidual meanings. And then there is the musicality: steps matching the music’s rhythms, steadily at first, accelerating into complexity, with additive rhythms that feel like a movie chase scene, the sense that you’re almost home thwarted by another corner turned and a swell of heady anticipation.A new piece by choreographer Mavin Khoo is performed by two young dancers trained in Chennai, Neha Mondal Chakravarty and Renjith Babu: she, sharp to the rhythms and subtle of facial expression he, warm, innocently impish, and very good at headstands. Babu, as Shiva, remains poised in upside-down contemplation, while Chakravarty kicks up the sand border separating the stage from the musicians, playing out the destructive force of goddess Kali. Chakravarty swells with strength then suddenly shrinks with fear, as the pair appear to be locked in a battle with themselves and each other.It’s all framed by an arresting lighting installation, hundreds of bulbs hanging in a radiant ceiling that shape-shifts for each piece across both evenings of the festival. It glows over dancer Sujata Mohapatra in a piece of odissi dance, passed down from her guru, theatrically telling the story of Sita, Rama and a 10-headed demon. Mohapatra looks a like a temple carving of a goddess come to life, elaborately costumed in blue, red, gold and pearl, she floats above the pounding beats and thick string tones of the music, an utterly beguiling presence. Her face flits from coy to knowing, to blithe and beatific but it’s with her hands she casts her spell – there’s something magic going on there. Imagine a voice with rich, honeyed tones and transfer that to the expression of wrists and digits.By contrast, kathak performer Gauri Diwakar is a more naturalistic, human presence. Kathak is an earthier, more virtuosic form, and choreographer Aditi Mangaldas plays with its velocity in sudden stops and suspensions. It’s also a dance form that truly embodies music, Diwakar’s feet stamping to the tabla and pakhawaj drum, while her arms and gently jutting chin play a melody.Darbar offers only a small dip into the vast history, and present, of classical Indian dance, but it’s great to see some of the breadth and quality of that art form centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411747fc874e04aaf7a06d8b0966f9a6678c2cb1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98bead8cea036f38fd0251abda273640","title":"first impressions exes and smooth exits master the art of conversation","story":"There’s no avoiding it, the season filled with cheer is also filled with chat – conversations you don’t want to have and ones you want to shine in. From how to tell a joke to how to handle an ex, experts advise A funny thing happens at the beginning of December. Suddenly, as the year comes to a close, you find yourself unable to say no to mulled wine, even if a hot, sickly-sweet punch is antithetical to your idea of good drinking colleagues regarded as the most dogged homebodies now seem to be joining you at the pub then the whole thing is brought to a close by spending the day with a group of people, most often related to you, many of whom you haven’t seen for a year, and will most likely not see again for another year.What all of this means is that if there’s one thing you’d better be ready for come Christmastime, it’s to socialise – to chat your way through dinner parties, drinks receptions, office get-togethers and pubs. Which is why we’ve solicited the advice of relationship columnist Justin Myers, AKA the Guyliner, linguist and communication expert Malgorzata Chalupnik, and drinks writer Nina Caplan to cover a few of the conundrums you’re likely to come up against this silly season, starting with …How to make a good first impression“One of the biggest letdowns when meeting someone for the first time is their evident lack of interest,” says Myers. “When someone asks you something, what they really want to do is tell you what they think. All it takes is ‘and you?’ once you’ve given your answer, and you’re already way ahead of most people,” he says.Chalupnik adds the key isn’t just paying attention, but outwardly conveying the fact that you are paying attention – what she describes as “active listenership”.“We constantly reveal more about ourselves to others through how we say things, our body language, our facial expressions and gestures. Making a good impression is not just about what we say, it can also revolve around the idea of how we show that we pay attention to other people,” she says.“Active listenership itself is all about showing that we listen to other people. The way to best signal it is through eye contact, orientating our body towards the speaker and nodding to show that we’re engaged.”And how do we know if it’s worked?“The theory of communication accommodation argues that if we like someone, we’re more likely to speak or act like them,” Chalupnik says. “If you notice that the person you are talking to starts sounding a bit more like you, for example, you are on the right track.”How to make small talkYou may not like it, but the need to make small talk is one of life’s unavoidable realities – and for good reason, according to Chalupnik. “Small talk establishes and maintains harmonious social relations,” she says.But this fact doesn’t make it any less challenging. “Small talk is terrifying only because we’re scared of boring each other to death,” says Myers. “How small should the talk stay? Weather? No, please, no. Vague humble bragging about your job or loft conversion? It’s a tough one.” His advice is that winning at the small talk game is all about keeping things “light, topical and totally devoid of political posturing – it can never end well”.“Box sets, fitness regimes, favourite restaurants and books are a popular way of revealing aspects of your personality without outing yourself as too much of a nightmare,” he says. “Sport, too, if you can bear the armchair punditry.”If you still find the idea of small talk stomach-churning, it’s worth remembering that you don’t have to do all the work – listening and accommodating others is just as important, says Chalupnik. “As with making a good first impression, the key is to provide all speakers the chance to engage,” she says.How to tell an anecdote or joke We’ve all been there: that moment when your great punchline is met with stony silence. It’s not a pleasant feeling, and it’s something that, once burned, we wouldn’t look to repeat. The good news is that there are strategies to avoid this, says Myers.“Read the room first. There’s nothing worse than launching into your best gag only to see horror creep across the faces of your audience,” he says. “It’s best to wait for a gap in conversation, too. Nobody likes being yanked out of a deep conversation only to be told a joke of Christmas cracker calibre.”Chalupnik concurs: “Know your audience. Know your context,” she says. “Humour, despite being a very useful and multi-faceted device, can also backfire.” She advises sticking to self-denigrating, anecdotal humour and avoiding sarcasm, which can be easily misread.“Sarcasm can carry a potentially aggressive meaning, so its interpretation can vary depending on the person we speak to,” she says. “Before using sarcasm, make sure that you are certain that they don’t mind it.”In much the same way, Myers believes that telling an anecdote well requires a good dose of self-awareness and respect for the time of the person to whom you are talking. “Have faith in the anecdote,” he says. “Tell it confidently and as quickly as possible without losing your listeners or missing parts out. And never, ever preface an anecdote or joke with: ‘Listen to this, it’s brilliant’ – the only way from there is down.”How to talk about alcohol like a proFrom knowing how to comment on a wine you’ve been sharing, to knowing when to avoid telling a debauched drinking tale, there is absolutely a right and a wrong way to talk about alcohol, according to food journalist Caplan.“Gauge your audience,” she says. “There’s no point telling stories about drunkenness to a clutch of wine professionals, and there’s equally little to gain in wittering on about grape varieties and soil types to twentysomethings in the pub.”Myers offers a similar view on those stories detailing some prodigious feat of alcoholic intake, which is that they are to be avoided entirely. “Never, ever mention how many drinks it takes to make you fall over,” he says. “Drunk stories are not badges of honour any more.”But it is possible to talk about alcohol with both dignity and tact, says Caplan, particularly when it comes to wine and grape-distilled spirits. “There are a few basic flavour profiles you can learn,” she says. “So, new world rieslings are quite often tropical in flavour, syrahs are spicy and peppery. Cognacs tend to have nutty andor fruity notes.”If you’re after a quick way to sound like you know what you’re talking about, Caplan suggests you start by dropping these keywords: bouquet (“this basically translates to: ‘what the wine smells like’ – but a much prettier word”), blend (“if there is more than one kind of grape in the wine, it’s a blend”) and tannin (“if the wine has a chewy, slightly drying sensation in the mouth, tannins – compounds found in the grape – are responsible”).“Just remember that they are your tastebuds,” says Caplan. “So, even if what you smell or taste is entirely different from what the books or your companions tell you, nobody can tell you that you’re wrong.”Alternatively, stay away from precise descriptions altogether, and wow ‘em with some fun boozy titbits instead: “For instance,” Caplan says, “the oldest and finest cognacs are aged in a special cellar, accessible only to the cellar master. This cellar within a cellar is so-named because the portion of the liquid in the barrel that evaporates as it ages is known as the angels’ share.” Baptiste Loiseau, the cellar master for Rémy Martin, says that their angels’ share equates to as much as 8,000 bottles a day (he also says you should serve their Rémy Martin 1738 with frozen grapes instead of ice cubes, so it doesn’t get diluted – serve that as you drop the angels’ share bomb for serious pro points).Pick up a bottle hereHow to speak to someone you kissed under the mistletoe last ChristmasIn a month defined by a) large gatherings and b) large measures, its not unthinkable that you might bump into a ghost of Christmas’ past – whether a one-time, under the mistletoe thing or a full-on ex – so you need to learn how to handle it like an adult.“‘I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on’ is an opener best avoided,” says Myers. “Chatting to people we’ve kissed is only awkward because we insist on acting like teenagers around one another,” says Myers.“If you haven’t been in touch since,” he says, “you may have to wheel out an apology. ‘I’ve been so busy, I’m rubbish at keeping in touch’, is the excuse they expect, so don’t let them down.”Otherwise, he advises “not to mention the kiss”, but do your best to “be charming and, most of all to not expect a repeat performance”.And when it comes to an unexpected encounter with an ex? “As is the case with any conversation, being civil is a good idea,” says Chalupnik. “If there is any conflict there, your aim should be to gradually moderate your position and de-escalate the verbal conflict.” In other words, play nice.And finally, how to make a polite exitWhether you’re just pulling out of a conversation, or leaving a party outright, knowing how to make a polite exit is an underrated and poorly understood social skill, says Myers.“Once a conversation has run its course, it can still be tricky to bring it to an official end,” he says. “Even awkward silences and the dreaded ‘well …’ leave some undaunted. The best way to get out of a conversation is to start another one.”“It’s like a relay,” he says. “Either offer to go get them a drink and then bring someone else back with you to freshen things up, or say you’d like to introduce them to someone, and take them to join this new group. Then, once they’re chatting, make your departure. And if they do come to find you, have a spare drink at hand just in case, give it to them, exclaim ‘There you are!’ and await your Oscar nomination for best reaction.”Of course, making an exit – especially at this time of year – can be as much about knowing your limits as anything else. “Learning when to say ‘stop’ is part of becoming an adult,” says Caplan. “You have to ask yourself: ‘is this actually fun?’ And if the answer is ‘no’, you’ve probably surpassed your limits.”For more smart conversation starters, La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club offers cultural events, masterclasses and experiences from the leading names in food and drink, art and design, fashion, film and more from their residency at London’s Bibendum.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f1baa42848086581eec715d14587ea317697/0_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47969a859d56d75d5d9857be65d4bda3","title":"the 12 saves of christmas an expert survival guide","story":"From emergency gift ideas to master mixology – via Jackson Boxer’s ballotine and Patrick Grant’s suit – experts share their must-haves and must-dos for surviving the festive season 1.

Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes.

Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Type ‘HIIT’ into YouTube and do a 30-minute home workout, using nothing but your body weight to induce sweat and burn Christmas dinner calories. If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin.

And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy.

On any given weekday you can feast your eyes on the rather excellent Warwick Davis-fronted Tenable the unabashed imbecility of Tipping Point the surprisingly white-knuckle The Chase the intriguingly gimmicky Hardball and, of course, the peerless Pointless. Such riches.Eggheads predates all of these – it is now in year 15 of its life – and its longevity is a testament to its simplicity. In a nutshell: could you prevail against the most formidable pub quiz team in the UK: one populated by former contestants from Mastermind and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? The current Eggheads even look like the kind of people who carpet-bomb quiz nights every night for the prize money. They are damn near unassailable, which seems to be the point.So what, I hear you cry, could possibly be Eggheads’ hammerhead-hopping moment? I mentioned earlier – you may even remember this – that the assembled Eggheads look like a pub quiz team. This is in no way meant to belittle pub quiz teams. The current lineup just has the look of people who would get excited by a “free chips for all teams” offer. It was not always thus.Once upon a time, there was another Egghead. Cut from entirely different cloth, he was an Egghead defined by his otherness. His name was Joe Connagh, AKA CJ de Mooi (his male-modelling pseudonym, “de Mooi” being Dutch for “the pretty”). You can already see how CJ might stick out on Eggheads – chiselled self-adoring pseudonym – and on the Eggheads team. CJ was like Chris Pratt in Jurassic World: the alpha male to his team of quiz velociraptors. Eggheads should have moved heaven and Earth to hang on to CJ instead it let him go. What CJ represented was the last bastion of true personality on the show, and it helped that he was not as insanely knowledgeable as his fellow Eggheads and, in fact, usually looked quite uncomfortable in their presence.Since his departure, Eggheads has acquired a coterie of nine uber-smartarses, who are a) Seemingly unburdened by anything even remotely resembling a personality, and b) More or less unbeatable in quizzes. They are too clever to entertain any more. Eggheads is now less a quizshow, more a Harlem Globetrotters-style exercise in toying with, and ultimately humiliating, lesser opposition. It is like watching Christians being fed to particularly tedious and unattractive lions in cardigans.The Chase makes for an interesting comparison. On ITV’s substantially more dynamic show, they actively try to make their “Chasers” personalities in their own right: stone-faced, fearsome-but-wisecracking general-knowledge cyborgs. Indeed, one of them, Anne “The Mistress” Hegerty, has reached such heights of fame that she has been deemed worthy of a place in the current series of I’m a Celebrity. You would not, it’s fair to say, ever want to see an Egghead eating grubs or bathing in a waterfall. And sadly, we don’t especially want to see them glumly winning a quizshow every day, either.

The first is a rainfall warning affecting Munster, Dublin Carlow, Kilkenny Wexford , Galway and Mayo. It is valid between 2am and 2pm on Tuesday.Heavy rain is expected on Monday night and early on Tuesday, with 20-30mm predicted to fall in a short time, leading to some surface flooding.The second alert is a wind warning, valid between 3am and 3pm on Tuesday, affecting Munster, Dublin, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Wicklow, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo. Southeasterly winds will strengthen on Monday night and during Tuesday, reaching mean speeds of 50-60kmh and gusts of 90-100kmh.

The investigation is called the Implant Files.As part of the project an online database, the International Medical Devices Database, has been developed by the ICIJ. It allows easy public access to data on adverse events linked to, or potentially linked, to medical devices.The database, which mostly involves US reports, can be searched by product name so that implant recipients can access information about their devices. However, it is not intended to be a substitute for medical advice.While there is extensive information about possible medical device failures available publicly in the US, and less so in EU member states, the Implant Files investigation has found that fewer than 20 per cent of countries globally make data available to the public on device recalls and other safety issues.In Ireland, data about safety notices and device recalls is published on the HPRA website.The investigation has raised concerns about devices that have been withdrawn in one country for safety reasons still being available in others.Orthopaedic, gastroenterological, urological and cardiovascular devices show the highest level of recalls for safety reasons in the US.An examination of millions of US adverse event reports found almost 500,000 cases where patients with implanted medical devices were getting them removed, or “explanted”.Figures given to The  by the HPRA for the period 2015-2018 show that last year there were 1,041 adverse “incidents” reported to the authority.An adverse incident is an unexpected bad medical development that may be associated with a patient’s medical device, and is different from an “adverse event” which, in HPRA terminology, involves bad health episodes that would be expected with patients using the device concerned – for example, those with very weak hearts.The adverse incident figure for 2016 was 859, while the figure for 2018 to the end of September was 838.Of the 1,041 incidents reported in 2017, investigations have been completed in 594 cases and, of these, 156 were found to have been definitively linked to the patient’s medical device.Overall, 80 per cent of the 2017 cases for which investigations have been concluded were found to be incidents which were caused, directly or partly, by the medical device, or which led to the manufacturer taking some type of corrective action. The rate was slightly less in other years.Medical device manufacturers are obliged to report adverse health outcomes that might be linked to their devices to the HPRA. Medical practitioners and others are also urged to report suspected cases.The figures supplied by the HPRA show that the bulk of the incident reports it receives come from manufacturers and that there has been a steady rise in the total number of reports over recent years, with the total in 2011 being just 112.The head of medical device regulation with the HPRA, Dr Niall MacAleenan, said the increase was mostly due to the drive to encourage better reporting. The authority conducts audits on manufacturers to ensure they are complying with their obligations.There was a spike in reports in 2012, when the total jumped to 706 from the previous year’s 408. Dr MacAleenan said this was due to the DePuy metal hip device, which has since been removed from the market.Globally DePuy, which is a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, is expected to pay out up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages and patient care costs arising from the withdrawn device.Ireland had the largest per capita uptake of the DePuy hip in the world and an examination of how the product came to market is published today by The . More than 1,000 people have lodged High Court proceedings against DePuy.The DePuy hip controversy, and a scandal over industrial grade silicone being used in breast implants, led to the decision to reform the EU system of medical device regulation. The new structure is likely to see increased levels of clinical trials being conducted, according to Dr MacAleenan.The reforms are also expected to lead to greater levels of information being put into the public domain.Medical devices require a different type of regulation to that of pharmaceuticals, not least because they are often designed to be inside a patient’s body for years, according to Dr MacAleenan.“Risk is inevitable with implanted devices. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”The Fine Gael MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament, Mairéad McGuinness, who played an important role in the negotiation of the new EU regime, said parts of the structure that were being replaced were “not fit for purpose”.However, she said it was important that an industry that was constantly producing new products that save lives and address chronic medical conditions was not over-regulated.“Activists and NGOs criticise the close links between academia and industry but it is the only way the sector can produce what it does,” she told The .Ireland is a global hub for medical devices, which account for almost 10 per cent of its exports.Last Wednesday the Department of Health extended restrictions on the use of a medical device product, the vaginal mesh, in relation to some conditions. The mesh has caused severe complications in a number of women including damage caused by bits of the mesh breaking off and cutting through patients’ flesh. The product can be extremely difficult to explant as the body grows around and into it.Josephine Kilroy (58), from Newport, Co Mayo, who received a mesh implant in 2007 to treat a bladder problem, is hoping that it can be removed early next year by a surgeon in London.The former taxi operator said pain and other complications associated with the device had caused her to be all but confined to her home.“I went from having everything, and being happy, to losing everything, all because of the mesh. It has taken my whole life from me,” she told The .A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709949.1543163055!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland second only to germany for medical device exports","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe medical devices sector employs 38,000 people in Ireland.“Tourists aside, one out of every eight people you walk past in Galway is involved in the medical device industry,” says Prof Abhay Pandit, a biomedical engineer based in Galway university.The importance of the medical devices sector to the Irish economy is not as well publicised as that of the major technology corporations such as Apple or Google, or the big pharma companies such as Pfizer, but is of a similar scale.Medical devices make up almost 10 per cent of all Irish exports and Ireland comes second only after Germany as the largest European exporter of medical devices. Total employment, in indigenous and multinational businesses, is 38,000.Four out of five of stents used worldwide are produced in Ireland. Half of the ventilators used in acute hospitals worldwide are produced here, as are a third of the world’s contact lenses. More than 30 million people with diabetes use injectable devices made in Ireland.Europe’s premier cluster of medical devices companies is based in the Galway region, according to Enterprise Ireland.Abbott, Stryker, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, GE Healthcare, Medtronic, Shire and Boston Scientific are among the top global medical device corporations that have substantial operations here employing large numbers of skilled staff.The industry and its regulatory framework have come in for scrutiny after several companies – including some with significant Irish operations – made multimillion-dollar settlements in the United States arising from investigations into bribery and scandals linked to the promotion of their products.Last year Shire, a biopharmaceutical corporation that has its headquarters on Baggot Street in Dublin, but has its main operational base in the US, made a $350 million false claims settlement with the US authorities arising from an investigation into the payment of kickbacks.The kickback payments were linked to sales of Dermagraft, a human skin substitute approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It was the largest ever kickback settlement involving a medical device and involved allegations that “Dermagraft salespersons unlawfully induced clinics and physicians with lavish dinners, drinks, entertainment and travel, medical equipment and supplies, unwarranted payments for purported speaking engagements and bogus case studies, and cash, credits and rebates, to induce the use of Dermagraft.” The settlement did not involve Shire admitting to any wrongdoing.Also last year Medtronic, the world’s largest manufacturer of medical devices, which has had its headquarters in Dublin since the formerly US corporation moved here in 2015, agreed to pay $12 million in the US in settlement of claims that it paid millions of dollars in consulting fees to doctors who published studies in peer-reviewed journals that downplayed the adverse effects of a Medtronic product.Medtronic said in a statement at the time that nothing in the settlement could be taken as a concession that it admitted to wrongdoing.The controversial articles concerned a bone-growth protein, Infuse, which had been approved for use in surgery for lower back pain but was used extensively for upper spine and neck repairs, sometimes leading to death and serious injury. Such off-label use is legal but cannot be promoted by the manufacturer.An investigation in 2012 by the US Senate finance committee found Medtronic had been “heavily involved” in shaping the content of published studies on Infuse.The committee said Medtronic had been “involved in drafting, editing and shaping the content of medical journal articles authored by its physician consultants who received significant amounts of money through royalties and consulting fees from Medtronic”.In Europe Infuse was marketed under the name InductOS. Its use in the European Union was suspended in 2015 because of concerns with the manufacturing process involved.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (J\u0026ampJ), which operates a number of major plants in Ireland, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US authorities in 2011 and paid a $21.4 million fine arising from the bribery of doctors in Greece.The bribery involved payments to Greek hospital doctors to encourage them to use orthopaedic products produced by the J\u0026ampJ subsidiary DePuy, which has operations in Ireland. Documents published by the US department of justice (DoJ) show the bribery operation was discussed by DePuy executives who met at a conference in Dublin in 2000.DePuy orthopaedic products were sold at significant discounts to an Isle of Man intermediary in order to produce profits that could then be used for bribing the Greek doctors for implanting the devices into their patients.The US investigation concluded that between 1996 and 2006, DePuy authorised payments of about €16.4 million to Greek agents knowing that much of the money would be used to pay cash incentives to publicly-employed Greek doctors to induce them to use DePuy products in their patients.In a “deferred prosecution agreement” published in 2011, J\u0026ampJ agreed that the facts outlined were true and accurate.The contribution to humanity of the medical device sector over recent decades has been enormous, says Pandit.“A few decades ago, cardiac surgery for a person in their 70s would have been unthinkable. Now it can be done in minimally invasive ways. A heart valve put into a 60-year-old is likely to last for 20 years, but now it is possible to put in a new one.”He has faith in the medical and research journals and the tests and studies done on medical devices, despite the well-aired issue of financial links between manufacturers and the physicians and scientists who are reviewing their products.Because bodies are so complex, there is a huge range of reactions across a population to a particular implanted device. This makes it difficult to fully test a product prior to its being released to the market.“It is a risk-to-benefit ratio. We can do as much as we can to show that the thing is safe to put in the body. The way to look at it is, in the circumstances, would I put this in my mother’s body, or in my father’s eye? Would I put it in my own body?”Pandit says Ireland’s corporation tax rate is not the sole reason for its relatively enormous medtech sector. “It is just the icing on the cake. The ecosystem is the thing, and the English language. The labour force is highly trained, and the higher-education institutes are equipped for clinical trials. It’s well-rooted. I’m not saying that tax doesn’t help, but it’s more than that.”Galway is part of the constituency of the Fine Gael MEP and vice-president of the European Parliament Mairéad McGuinness, who played an important role in the negotiations on a new regulatory regime for the medical devices sector in the EU.“Activists and NGOs criticise the close links between academia and industry but it is the only way the sector can produce what it does,” she says.While it is crucial that trust is maintained in the medical device sector, the benefits to the community of successful medical devices are enormous and it is important that it is not made too difficult for companies to bring new products to market, McGuinness says.Concerns exist over the extent to which the new regime which is to be put in place by 2020 can be sufficiently resourced with skilled staff.The system involves “notified bodies” giving CE marks to new medical device products, with certification from any notified body allowing a product on to the entire EU market.One of the recognised problems with the old regime was the closeness between the industry and some of the private, commercial bodies that were charged with certifying new products for the market. Ireland’s notified body, the Irish National Standards Authority, is publicly owned and highly regarded. However, the number of extant medical devices that it has given approval for numbers in the low hundreds.That close collaboration with industry is necessary is a view shared by Dr Martin O’Halloran, a senior lecturer in medical electronics in NUIG.O’Halloran is director of the Translation Medical Device Lab, which is embedded in Galway University Hospital and is focused on Ireland’s indigenous medtech sector and the development of new products.“What we do is evaluate the commercial potential at the outset,” says O’Halloran. “It means that for anything that is developed there will be an appetite for it.”People at an early stage of their career are recruited from university and sent into hospital to “look for problems that need to be solved”. They then look for people with specialist knowledge. A specialist team of three members is often formed, with a clinical doctor, an engineer and a commercial person working together. Often these teams can end up creating a start-up company around their proposed medical device.O’Halloran works on the electrical properties of human tissue and is currently working on a microwave imaging device for breast cancer screening.A lot of contemporary work is being led by engineering, he says. “The next generation of medical devices will be electro-mechanical. It will be smart or personalised devices that don’t just treat disease but preserve the quality of life.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709919.1543161217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"medical devices often allowed onto market without human tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAs part of EU reforms now being rolled out, there is increased cross-auditing of different member states’ regulatory bodies.The regulation of medical devices in the European Union is a national competency, unlike with pharmaceuticals, which are regulated centrally by the European Medicines Agency.Each member state has a regulator, which in turn authorises notified bodies which can award CE marks. The mark indicates the product conforms with the health, safety and environmental protection standards of the European Economic Area which includes the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.The CE mark awarded by a notified body in one member state allows the product be marketed across the union. Furthermore, the awarding of a CE mark also serves to open up other markets around the globe, where many poorer countries are reliant on the EU and US regulatory regimes.In Ireland the regulator is the Health Products Regulation Agency (HPRA), which has authorised the State-owned Irish National Standards Authority to act as a notified body.Other jurisdictions have more than one notified body, and some of these notified bodies were commercial operations reliant on the fees they received from the manufacturers whose products they were able to grant or deny access to the market. It was a system that was only as strong as its weakest link.As part of the EU reforms now being rolled out, there is increased cross-auditing of different member states’ regulatory bodies and notified bodies, as well as increased oversight by the European Commission. This, and new, higher standards that are being imposed, has seen a reduction in the number of notified bodies in the EU from 81 to 56 over recent years.Fine Gael MEP Mairéad McGuinness, vice-president of the European Parliament, was actively involved in the reform process. The metal hip controversy, and the PIP breast implant scandal, caused the EU to take a closer look at a regulatory system that did not appear to be working. “The notified bodies and their relationships with industry was one of the questions raised,” says McGuinness.Officials from the commission’s directorate on health and food safety, which is based in Co Meath, went out to the member states and closed down a number of notified bodies, she says, some of which were “not fit for purpose”.Now that a more robust system is being put in place, the challenge is to get the people with the required skills. “People want less bureaucracy but more safety, but that takes more regulation and it takes resources,” says McGuinness.Brexit is not helping matters as the UK’s four notified bodies currently account for a large proportion of the new medical devices that get CE marks ever year. It is likely the UK notified bodies will open offices in other EU member states so they can continue working, but the disruption is another complication at a time when the system is undergoing reform, the number of new technologies seeking certification continues to grow, and the number of notified bodies is being reduced.“The industry is moving so fast and so furiously,” says McGuinness. “There is a need to draw people out from industry to work on regulation, as no one else would know the necessary detail.”Medical devices are often not screened by way of clinical trials before they are approved for the market, in the way new drugs are, but this is because they act in a fundamentally different way, says Dr Niall MacAleenan, head of the medical devices section at the HPRA.Innovative devices that have been developed over recent years have transformed medical services, saved and extended countless lives, and provided ways to ease the suffering of huge numbers of people with chronic conditions. Stents have transformed cardiac care, while insulin pumps, pain-management devices and improved prosthetics have brought relief to tens of millions.In part because medical technology has been so successful, the devices that are now available are often inside people’s bodies for years, if not decades. Also new, high-risk technologies introduced for people with conditions likely to cause death if not untreated sometimes become less risky as they are developed over time and surgeons become more skilled at implanting them, thereby changing the risk-benefit analysis.For these and other reasons, new devices are often allowed on to the market after serious laboratory-based and other testing, but without being tested on humans. The manufacturers are then obliged to monitor their use and to report back to regulators any apparent problems that may be coming to their notice. This is called “post-market surveillance”.The regime involves the making of “risk-benefit” estimations, says MacAleenan. With implanted devices especially, “there is always risk. The question is if it an acceptable level of risk.”Over recent years manufacturers and doctors have been reporting more than 800 adverse incidents a year to the HPRA. These are adverse medical events which would not be expected, ie a sudden failure of a device as against, for example, a patient who had a very severe cardiac condition dying of a heart attack. Many of the ensuing investigations have established either a definitive link with a medical device, or a conclusion that a device was probably or could have been a contributory factor to the adverse incident. No deaths have been definitively found to be directly attributable to a medical device over recent years, MacAleenan says.Frequently the response to such incidents is the taking of what is called a “field action”, which might be renewed or revised advice on the use of the device, or alterations to its nature.An interesting feature of the reports is that in between a fifth to a quarter of the incidents the device has not been retrieved from the person who suffered the adverse incident, and so it cannot be examined by the HPRA investigators.“Incident reports are not the be-all and end-all of what we do and are only part of the post-market surveillance,” says MacAleenan. The manufacturers are audited to ensure they are properly collecting information about their products and responding to any difficulties that may be emerging.The resolution of a lot of the problems identified is most often arrived at from dialogue between the manufacturer and the regulator, and often involves solutions suggested by the manufacturer.Medical devices are not like cars or other machines that can be withdrawn from the market without serious negative consequences if a problem is identified. Often the devices are providing crucial benefits to people who are in dire need of care, and the identified flaw feeds into a new risk-benefit analysis.“Medical technology has completely changed the treatment of so many different conditions,” says MacAleenan. “Many areas of medical care have been revolutionised.”The expectation is that the revolution is going to continue and that the medical device sector is set to involve a lot more connected technology, which will collect data from, and deliver instructions to, sophisticated medical devices. (The former US vice-president Dick Cheney had his heart device’s wireless capability switched off so it could not be hacked by terrorists anxious to kill him.)More and more devices are being managed by lay people and are being controlled outside hospital environments.The reformed EU regulatory regime for medical devices creates challenges for the sector and is likely to see an increased level of clinical screening, and increased amounts of information becoming available to the public, says MacAleenan.The challenges facing the regulatory system arise from the new improved regime, but also the changing nature of the technologies being produced by an innovative sector that shows no signs of slowing down.A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710106.1543171085!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar the alternative to this deal is a no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar discusses the outcome of the EU Council summit meeting in Brussels. “Any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations.” Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireThe alternative to the withdrawal treaty between the EU and the UK formally signed off in Brussels on Sunday is “no-deal and a cliff-edge Brexit”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after the conclusion of the summit.“It’s going to become more and more obvious that the alternative to this deal is a no-deal scenario,” Mr Varadkar told reporters after EU leaders emerged from the EU Council meeting which approved the text of the withdrawal treaty.Echoing other EU leaders, Mr Varadkar said that the withdrawal treaty is the “only deal that’s on the table”.“I hear a lot of people talking about better deals and alternative deals. And anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds, but an agreement – 500 pages long, that 28 member states can sign up to – nobody has that,” he said.EU leaders were determined to convey the “this deal or no deal” message after a relatively perfunctory summit meeting which concluded after about two hours on Sunday morning, while British prime minister Theresa May also stressed that the current treaty was the best outcome that the UK could expect.Nevertheless, senior sources in both Brussels and the Irish Government acknowledged that the prospects of Ms May securing the acceptance of the British parliament for the treaty – at least on its first vote – were slim.Asked if he was ruling out any change to the exit mechanism from the backstop, which has emerged as a significant issue in London, Mr Varadkar replied: “I am, and it’s not just me, it’s the entire European Union today was very much of the view there couldn’t be a renegotiation.”Mr Varadkar said the “core difficulty” among those arguing for a better deal for the UK was that they “don’t agree among themselves” what a better deal could look like.“So really what’s being put before the European Parliament and the House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations,” Mr Varadkar said.Mr Varadkar said that he understood the position of the DUP, which held its conference in Belfast on Saturday, but he would “posit a counterview”.He said that the deal agreed between the UK and the EU was “very much in line with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement”.He stressed everyone accepted Northern Ireland was and would remain part of the UK until such time as the people of Northern Ireland might vote otherwise, but that because of its “unique history and unique geography” it had special arrangements “that on occasion make it a little different from the rest of the UK”.Citing examples in agriculture, energy, corporation tax, human rights issues and “issues of personal liberty like marriage equality and a woman’s right to choose”, Mr Varadkar said that he didn’t think that “having a special arrangement relating to market regulations on industrial goods is fundamentally different from the special arrangements that exist already”.But, speaking at the DUP conference, MP Sammy Wilson accused the Government of “intransigence” and “not acting in good faith”.Mr Wilson told The  that once the economic implications of the proposed agreement being rejected by the UK parliament become clear, the EU and Irish Government “will be scurrying back wanting to get a deal done”.He argued that the Irish economy would be worst hit in a no-deal scenario where Irish beef, dairy and other agri-food exports to the UK would be hit with high World Trade Organisation tariffs.“We could get beef cheaper from Brazil than we could get from Ireland, so if Irish farmers want their government to ruin their agricultural economy, that is an issue which will have to be dealt with in the Irish Republic,” he said.Ian Paisley jnr, another DUP MP, said technical solutions, including trusted trader schemes and tax gatheringsharing arrangements, should be put “to the forefront of negotiations” to find an acceptable alternative to maintain an invisible border.“If I was the Irish Government, I would be trying to explain to my traders in the south of Ireland why they are not working so hard on a real trade deal,” he said.The DUP, which is keeping Ms May’s minority Conservative government in power at Westminster, is pushing for alternatives to the backstop in the legally binding Brexit treaty.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Mr Varadkar says he expects the British parliament will “sooner or later” support the Brexit deal which has been negotiated between the EU and the UK and agreed upon this weekend in Brussels. He said if Sinn Féin felt they cannot take up their seats because of their absentionist policy, they should consider resigning ahead of a vote on the deal in the House of Commons. “Sinn Féin is an unusual party in that it is not taking up its seats in Westminster for one reason and it isn’t taking up its seats in Stormont for another. “Generally people who get involved in politics get involved because they want to make a difference and use the democratic process to get good outcomes for citizens.“If they are not willing to take up their seats because they feel they can’t, because they got elected on the basis of abstentionism, they do have the option now of resigning their seats and allowing the people in those constituencies decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster.”He also sounded a note of optimism around whether the deal can be ratified by the UK parliament. “I think it is likely that the UK parliament sooner or later will agree to what has been agreed by the 28 member state governments.” Mr Varadkar said there had been a lot of focus on the backstop - the insurance mechanism to avoid a hard border in Ireland - but said the arrangement offered benefits to the UK also. “This is the best deal that was available to the UK. I know there is a lot of focus on the backstop but bear in mind one of the big benefits for the UK of the backstop is it provides for a single customs territory if we cannot agree a future relationship as President Macron pointed out yesterday. That means that even if we can’t negotiate a future relationship, the UK will continue to have access to EU markets through a single customs territory.” He said that EU leaders had collectively agreed over the weekend not to speculate too much on what would happen in a no-deal scenario.“What we decided to do at the European Council meeting was to collectively not speculate too much on a no deal scenario or on alternatives to what has been agreed. We don’t want to give the wrong impression to people whether they are passionate Remainers or passionate Brexiteers that there is another deal could command the support of 28 members states, there is not.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Almost a decade ago now he scandalised bankers and traders (although not the general public) when he declared the work of financiers to be\u0026nbsp“socially useless”.A few years ago he made himself almost equally unpopular in central banking\u0026nbspcircles by suggesting they should consider monetising debt to rebalance their economies.Between Debt and the Devil by Adair Turner, book reviewAnd now Baron Turner of Ecchinswell’s latest thesis is that politicians, everyone from the Chancellor Philip Hammond down, are talking rubbish about productivity.“What every politician always agrees is that the crucial thing we need to do is speed up the rate of productivity growth – every politician’s wrong!” the silver-haired 63-year-old declaims\u0026nbspin an interview with The Independent.Turner, whose technocratic career has taken him from the CBI, to the Climate Change Commission, to a major government review of pensions, to the chair of the Financial Services Authority, is now chair of George Soros’ Institute for\u0026nbspNew Economic Thinking. And the economic thinking he’s doing is certainly “new”. Downright heretical, many would say.So what’s led him to this radical conclusion that we should stop obsessing about productivity growth? The answer is twofold.First, he suspects automation is happening quicker than is being picked up by our official GDP statistics. Second, he thinks lots of the new service jobs being created as the mechanisable parts of the economy become\u0026nbspmore efficient are inherently “zero sum”, meaning they are competing for existing wealth rather than creating it.He gives an example of street sweepers and lawyers: “If we manage to create a totally effective automated street sweeping machine, nobody would have a job as a street sweeper. But if we apply IT to the limit to law, there’ll still be lawyers. It’s just that each of these two highly paid lawyers will now have software that review not simply many cases, but every single case that there’s ever been.“What do lawyers do? They fight against each other. If you make lawyer A and lawyer B both much more skilled than they were before, you can’t say there’ll be a better product, there’ll just be a more intense fight.”He thinks that focusing on productivity growth in this context will not help to deliver a higher quality of living for most people. Indeed, he fears it could actually end up harming living standards, citing the example of those who provide social care for the frail elderly.“What do we do with those jobs at the moment? We reduce their status and their cost. We put them up for competitive bidding. And we bid down the price. And then we do these gig economy games where people being paid to do social care of the elderly aren’t even employed for movement between client one and client two we say you’re only working when you’re at the client. Then we tailorise their life. We say ‘you’ve got 14 minutes to clean someone’s bottom’…”The solution, Turner says, banging the desk of his Mayfair office for emphasis, is simply to stop focusing on the bottom line.“We’ve just got to pay more for social care – we’ve just got to make something which is valued. We’ve got to pay higher taxes to afford it. They’re never going to be high-paid jobs, but we should not be using the techniques of the market to skinny them down.”He concedes the macroeconomics of his argument, laid out in an extensive lecture in the US earlier this year,\u0026nbspis unproven. There are certainly many theoretical and empirical challenges that could be mounted. He also accepts that his thesis – saying\u0026nbspwe should focus more on distributing the GDP pie than making it bigger\u0026nbsp– will not be easily swallowed by\u0026nbsppolicymaking classes.Turner advises a start-up online bank – OakNorth – which he says has influenced his views on the rapid underlying speed of job-shedding automation.As chair of a group called Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), made up of public and private sector experts and executives, he’s also advising governments in China and India on decarbonisation.Despite Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris accord, Turner insists he’s relatively hopefully about the prospects of cracking the problem of a rapidly overheating planet.“We’re optimistic that there are bits of Indian policy that are heading in the right direction,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I’m optimistic that China gets it, that they are determined eventually to bring down their emissions, that they’ll develop renewables on a massive scale, that they’ll electrify their bus fleets, etc.“The thing that frustrates me about climate change is that we could get to 2060 and we could have a pretty close to zero carbon economy. Run the numbers and it’s completely doable by technologies that we know how to do. It is soluble if we just get on with it.”But what’s lacking from Turner’s employment portfolio is a major, high-profile, public sector job in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour seems an obvious fit. They could use someone with Turner’s economic and establishment credentials.And it turns out there has been some contact. On 19 May (the same day as Harry and Meghan’s wedding) Turner was to be found addressing Labour’s macroeconomic conference.Chair, Institute for New Economic Thinking since 2015But could he work with a party of politicians who\u0026nbspmany in the business world regard as\u0026nbspunreconstructed Marxists, a bigger threat to the economy even than Brexit?“The answer is I’d have to spend a bit more time,” he says, judiciously. “There are some things about some of the people around them of which I am suspicious. There seem\u0026nbspto be some people around them\u0026nbspwho genuinely do believe that Venezuela is a well-run country. You cannot believe that and be sensible. Venezuela is a disaster and it has been destroyed by a left-wing Marxist government that had oodles of oil revenues. You’ve got to say the way that the world is.”But he’s certainly not shutting the door.“There are things that make me wary of that tradition on the left which can see no problems with left-wing governments. On the other hand, there are other aspects of what they are saying that do not seem all that extreme or worrying.”The supreme British establishment technocrat taking a job with a radical left Labour team? That could be a Turner provocation to put\u0026nbspall his others in the shade.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Following an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp(CMA)\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had found that PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival”. The CMA also said its findings “raise\u0026nbspconcerns that the merger could result in customers, which include small and medium-sized businesses, paying higher prices or receiving a lower-quality service”.Google’s various payment services streamlined into one platformTommy Robinson banned from PayPalDid Paypal founder buy his New Zealand home as ‘apocalypse insurance’?PayPal completed its acquisition of the Swedish company in September, and the CMA began its probe of the deal in October.If PayPal and iZettle cannot address the regulator’s concerns, the merger will be referred for an indepth investigation. Andrea Gomes da Silva, CMA\u0026nbspexecutive director, said: “Payment services markets are evolving, so it’s particularly important to look to the future when we assess competition and the effects of mergers on customers.“While iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, it has already established a market-leading position in mobile point-of-sale devices and was well placed to compete against PayPal in other emerging markets. “That’s why we are concerned that PayPal’s takeover could lead to higher prices or reduce the quality of the services available to customers.”A PayPal spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“PayPal continues to work cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review of the acquisition of iZettle. We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate to the CMA that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The pound fell 0.19 per cent to €1.1284 off the back of reports that Italy is headed for a breakthrough with its budget, which would bring to an end weeks of wrangling between the EU and the Italian government. However, the UK currency rose 0.17 per cent against the dollar, to hit $1.2836, after EU leaders signed off on Theresa May’s Brexit deal over the weekend. May prepares to give statement on Brexit deal- liveEU leaders approve Theresa May’s Brexit but say it cannot be changedThe EU\u0027s austerity bias is to blame for the budget standoff with ItalyItaly\u0027s budget crisis is a bigger threat to the EU than BrexitConnor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “muted nature” of sterling at the open is “likely because Theresa May’s Brussels success comes laden with some potentially deal-sinking domestic caveats, namely the House of Commons’ ‘meaningful vote’ expected to be held on 12 December”.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, agreed that markets are likely to stay sensitive to any Brexit news in the coming weeks.“The fact that EU leaders have agreed the UK’s exit deal ultimately isn’t enough to convince the market that Brexit will be conducted smoothly,” he said. “Getting the deal approved by parliament is the real hard task, so UK equities are likely to remain volatile until the vote in mid-December.”Meanwhile, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said sterling traders “know very well that the real struggle is just about to begin”. “There’s a lot of bad news that is currently priced in sterling, but more to come if the deal is voted down by parliament, so expect risk to remain skewed to the downside,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk\u0027s rocket business is preparing for manned trips to Mars in the coming years, with the hope of making them relatively easily available.Do we really have a right to colonise Mars?You\u0027re 47, Mr Musk was asked as part of an interview for Axios\u0027s\u0026nbspnew show on HBO. What is the likelihood you personally will go to Mars?70 per cent, he replied\u0026nbspimmediately. We\u0027ve recently made a number of breakthroughs that I\u0027m just really fired up about.He went on to explain that he was talking about moving there, and that the price for the trip might eventually be only a couple of hundred thousand dollars.Pressed on whether he was working towards building an escape hatch for rich people, he said that the journey was going to be far more difficult than staying on our own planet would be.Your\u0026nbspprobability of dying on Mars if much higher than dying on Earth, he said, comparing it with Shackleton\u0027s trip to the Antarctic.It\u0027s going to be hard, there\u0027s a good chance of\u0026nbspdeath, going in a little can through deep space, he said.\u0026nbspYou might land successfully, once you land successfully you\u0027ll be working non-stop to build the base. So not much time for leisure.And once you get there, even after doing all this, it\u0027s a very harsh environment so there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll die there. We\u0026nbspthink you can come back but we\u0027re not sure. Now does that sound like an escape hatch for rich people?Despite all that he said he would unhesitatingly go and live on the planet, once SpaceX\u0026nbspmakes it possible.There\u0027s lots of people that climb mountains., he said. People die on Mount Everest all the time. They like doing it for the challenge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever.

This is an unprecedented move but it’s an unprecedented situation. We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest,”\u0026nbspMr Collins told the paper.Facebook had some “very serious questions” to answer, he said, and he accused it of misleading the committee over Russian involvement in the platform.“It has not answered our questions about who knew what, with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” Mr Collins said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.“We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.“We have no further comment.”\u0026nbspThe move comes after Mark Zuckerberg said he was “unable” to testify to an international “grand committee” investigating Facebook’s role in spreading fake news.The social media company will instead send Richard Allan, its vice president of policy solutions, to answer questions at a hearing in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Following an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp(CMA)\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had found that PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival”.

Andrea Gomes da Silva, CMA\u0026nbspexecutive director, said: “Payment services markets are evolving, so it’s particularly important to look to the future when we assess competition and the effects of mergers on customers.“While iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, it has already established a market-leading position in mobile point-of-sale devices and was well placed to compete against PayPal in other emerging markets. “That’s why we are concerned that PayPal’s takeover could lead to higher prices or reduce the quality of the services available to customers.”A PayPal spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“PayPal continues to work cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review of the acquisition of iZettle. We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate to the CMA that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

May prepares to give statement on Brexit deal- liveEU leaders approve Theresa May’s Brexit but say it cannot be changedThe EU\u0027s austerity bias is to blame for the budget standoff with ItalyItaly\u0027s budget crisis is a bigger threat to the EU than BrexitConnor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “muted nature” of sterling at the open is “likely because Theresa May’s Brussels success comes laden with some potentially deal-sinking domestic caveats, namely the House of Commons’ ‘meaningful vote’ expected to be held on 12 December”.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, agreed that markets are likely to stay sensitive to any Brexit news in the coming weeks.“The fact that EU leaders have agreed the UK’s exit deal ultimately isn’t enough to convince the market that Brexit will be conducted smoothly,” he said. “Getting the deal approved by parliament is the real hard task, so UK equities are likely to remain volatile until the vote in mid-December.”Meanwhile, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said sterling traders “know very well that the real struggle is just about to begin”. “There’s a lot of bad news that is currently priced in sterling, but more to come if the deal is voted down by parliament, so expect risk to remain skewed to the downside,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Using a variety of instruments, it will delve into the inside of the Mars surface, burying underneath.Elon Musk renames ‘BFR’ rocket to ‘Starship’As it does, it will send back information about what the planet looks like underneath that famous, dusty red surface. Scientists hope to learn about not only Mars itself but also about other rocky planets in our own solar system – including Earth.The rover will land on the surface this evening, UK time. Nasa will livestream the proceedings, and they will be covered as they happen here on\u0026nbspThe Independent.That descent is not guaranteed, and comes amid concern and upset about the future of the Opportunity rover. There have been numerous failed missions to Mars: from the European Space Agency’s\u0026nbspSchiaparelli\u0026nbsplander, which smashed into the surface in 2016 at such speed it could not have survived, all the way back to the original Soviet missions in the 1970s which repeatedly failed.This time around, we’ll get to know if it’s successful straight away. That’s thanks to two little flying robots known as CubeSats – named WALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film – which went to Mars on the same rocket that is carrying the new lander and will fly past the Red Planet, relaying messages about its progress to\u0026nbspground controllers nearly 100 million miles away.Once the lander arrives on Mars, it will sit stationary and begin its work, looking deep underneath the surface for clues about what is going on there. Using seismometers to measure the movement of the ground, and a heat probe to take its temperature, scientists will get their first look at what is happening deep in Mars – and hopefully provide some clues about how it formed and more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That was insensitive and ignorant.

Anti-Vax is equivalent to calling someone a n****r and makes as little sense.” \u0026nbspAfter Benson replied asking Rossio to “...please never come on my feed with the N-word again,” Rossio replied: “Do you realise that you are using the equivalent of the ‘N-word’ in promoting memes that tag people as ‘anti-vax?’ Do you realize that the same collectivist stereotyping lies behind belittling any group with a label?

The Brexiteers may lose their Brexit.”Ms Rudd also cast doubt on Ms May’s plans to seal the Brexit deal at a summit with EU leaders on Sunday, acknowledging there are still obstacles in the way.“Hopefully it will get through this week,” she said, adding: “There is still a negotiation going on in terms of actually getting this agreement through.”The comments make Ms Rudd the first cabinet minister to rule out a no-deal Brexit – and the first to suggest an agreement at European level could yet be derailed.They came as the prime minister prepared to head to Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, under huge pressure for further “wins” in the final text.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

The only deal possible.”\u0026nbspHe added: “Those who think that by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.”Outside the summit, pro-Remain activists took a blowtorch to a mock copy of the withdrawal agreement, before they were asked to stop by Belgian police.EU president Juncker says he would vote in favour of May’s Brexit dealEU leaders agree to back Theresa May’s Brexit dealTop ministers ‘plotting different Brexit’ if deal fails in CommonsTheresa May writes ‘letter to nation’ insisting Brexit agreement worksHigh Court to rule if Brexit vote ‘void’ amid Banks investigationSpeaking on the doorstep of the meeting, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he did not expect MPs to reject the deal.“I don’t expect a ‘no’ vote. I expect a ‘yes’ vote and this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more,” he said.Discussion about what to do in the event the deal was rejected was notable by its absence from the meeting, with one senior EU official saying there was “no appetite” for it after the gruelling slog to an agreement.“I don’t think there were any ‘what if’ questions asked to Theresa May today, quite a few were wishing her good luck,” they said.We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possibleIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: “We made the conscious decision as 27 not to speculate\u0026nbspon alternative scenarios.“We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possible.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz added: “It is important that everyone in the UK is aware of the fact that this agreement is the final result. It will definitely not be renegotiated and there will be no further leeway.”The European Council conclusions released after the meeting specifically thanked chief negotiator Michel Barnier “for his tireless efforts as the Union’s chief negotiator and for his contribution to maintaining the unity among EU27 member states throughout the negotiations”.\u0026nbspEU leaders met among\u0026nbspthemselves without Theresa May, and were then joined by the British prime minister to discuss the deal once they had signed it off.

The UK conceded in writing that Spain should have a veto over whether any future trade deal applies to Gibraltar – potentially storing up trouble down the road. Spain wants any future relationship governing the British overseas territory to be negotiated bilaterally between itself and the UK.Behind the scenes, officials in Brussels were delighted with the result, particularly the maintenance of EU unity in the face of British attempts to ide the bloc.“Many member states have had very particular concerns which are all legitimate, and there has been a willingness to accommodate,” one EU source said.“More fundamentally that says something about the nature of the union. The union stands up for its member states – like Spain, Ireland. This is the essence of the union. I would tend to borrow a slogan and say ‘Stronger In’.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Expect Brexiteer MPs to be furious if this goes ahead.Business leaders in Scotland are calling on the Scottish Government to set up a £75m fund to help companies deal with\u0026nbspBrexit.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotland made the plea ahead of Finance Secretary Derek Mackay setting out his Budget to Holyrood next month.With\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbsplooming, FSB’s Scotland policy chair Andrew McRae said the “top priority” for business north of the border was “avoiding a chaotic no-deal, no-transition\u0026nbspBrexit”.Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in Northern Ireland, has appealed to Labour MPs to vote for the government’s Brexit withdrawal deal.Senior figures from Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and Green Party all stated their support for Theresa May’s agreement after meeting business leaders at Stormont.Mr Eastwood said: “We don’t think there is a good\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspbut if we are going to have one, let’s try and limit the damage to our communities and our businesses and our society here. That’s what the backstop does, we need to bank that backstop, it is our ultimate insurance policy.”This is from the Labour whips account, who usually get advanced notification of all things happening in the Commons from their opposite numbers. They confirm there will be no urgent questions today in the chamber - meaning we go straight to main event at 3.30pm.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers, has criticised warnings of leaving the EU without a deal.He told LBC radio: These scare stories are absurd. We are not going to run out of clean drinking water. We managed to have clean drinking water long before a very large number of continental European countries, it is something we have been quite good at since the 19th century.We are going to get more of these scare stories but we need to make preparations, particularly to alleviate any problems around the Dover-Calais route.According to Reuters, the German finance minister Olaf Scholz has said Brexit will hurt everyone involved, but added the deal sealed on Sunday at the special EU council lays the foundations for a good development.\u0026nbspSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has also been on the airwaves this morning – claiming that if May’s Brexit deal fails to pass the Commons she could be sent back to Brussels to negotiate better terms.\u0026nbspAsked if Parliament can stop the clock running out on getting an agreement and preventing such an outcome, he admitted any motion by MPs to try and do so might not be binding.\u0026nbspHe told Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: If you had a vast majority saying we don\u0027t authorise the government to leave with no deal, it would be very difficult for the government politically to do so.\u0026nbspI accept that may not be legally binding, there would then have to be legislation before March for any government preparing for no deal and there would be plenty of opportunities to put amendments down to that to require the government to do things.\u0026nbspFor example, to extend Article 50. I accept that no deal is something that is going to have to involve the whole EU but I think there would be a very strong push by the majority in Parliament against no deal.\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think this Prime Minister would simply plough on regardless, as she knows how dangerous no deal is.\u0026nbspEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Junker has insisted the deal reach on Monday between the UK and the EU is the “best deal for Britain” and “the only possible deal”.\u0026nbspHe told Radio 4’s Today programme that if the House of Commons rejects the deal when asked to vote in the coming weeks, “we would have no deal”.\u0026nbspHe added: It\u0027s not the intention of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, nor of the Parliament, to go for a second referendum. This is the deal.\u0026nbspAsked if the Brexit negotiation was a punishment process for the UK, Mr Juncker said: I don\u0027t understand why the British people, and I like the British people for so many including historical reasons, why they are feeling that they are humiliated.\u0026nbspI don\u0027t see that because numerous points of view of the British have been taken into this deal. So, this is not a humiliation for Britain.Stephen Barclay - the new Brexit secretary - has admitted it will be a challenge to get May\u0027s deal through parliament as scores of MPs say they will vote against it.But he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today the PM\u0026nbsphas got the best agreement possible for the UK\u0026nbspafter her negotiations with Brussels.Asked about how the government will get the deal secured by Ms May at yesterday\u0027s summit approved by the House of Commons, Mr Barclay said: Well it\u0027s going to be a challenging vote.But it\u0027s now the job of all of us in Cabinet to make the case to our colleagues, to make the case to the country.The Prime Minister, after two years working day and night in the national interest, has secured a deal that respects the referendum result. And does so in a way that also protects jobs, that also gives security to EU citizens.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates.

I believe our national interest is clear, she will tell MPs. \u0026ldquoThe British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country whichever way we voted.                EU has secret plan to extend Article 50 amid fears over May\u0027s deal                Police forced to stop anti-Brexit protester sets fire to Brexit dealHer remarks come ahead of the crunch Commons vote on her Brexit deal that was endorsed by EU leaders at a summit in Brussels yesterday.Downing Street sources have told the  the historic vote will be held on December 12 following five full days of Commons debate.In a statement reporting on yesterday\u0027s summit, the Prime Minister will tell MPs today: Our duty - as a Parliament over these coming weeks - is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.\u0026ldquoThere is a choice which MPs will have to make.\u0026ldquoWe can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future of opportunity and prosperity for all our people.\u0026ldquoOr this House can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one.It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail.British Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: Sean GallupGetty Images)Mrs May will warn that the EU has given the UK a take-it-or-leave without a deal offer, saying: I can say to the House with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available.She will add: I believe our national interest is clear.\u0026ldquoThe British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country whichever way we voted.\u0026ldquoThis is that deal. A deal that delivers for the British people.Leaders of the 27 nations remaining in the EU after Britain leaves took just 38 minutes to rubber stamp the draft Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the UK\u0027s future relationship with the EU at a special summit in Brussels.At the gathering called to conclude 18 months of Brexit negotiations, a string of leaders said Parliament had to accept the deal on the table as no better alternative would be offered.                Labour\u0027s secret talks with People\u0026rsquos Vote backing SECOND REFERENDUM                Brexit news: May will revive THIS EU offer if Parliament rejects dealPresident of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker  (Image: Sean GallupGetty Images)European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: This is the deal. It\u0027s the best deal possible and the EU will not change its fundamental position when it comes to these issues, he said.Those who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte added: This is the deal on the table. I don\u0027t think there is anything more now.Mrs May yesterday acknowledged she faced a massive challenge to persuade MPs to back her deal in the run up to the vote. Five days of intense and rancorous Commons debates are expected in the run up to the crucial ision.It will be one of the most significant votes that Parliament has held for many years, the Prime Minister said at a news conference at the end of the Brussels summit yesterday.On it will depend whether we move forward together into a brighter future or open the door to yet more ision and uncertainty, she said.I will take this deal back to the House of Commons, confident we have achieved the best deal available and full of optimism about the future of our country.Mrs May yesterday acknowledged she faced a massive challenge to persuade MPs to back her deal (Image: )In Parliament and beyond it, I will make the case for this deal with all my heart and I look forward to that campaign.She added: The British people don\u0027t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit.They want a good deal done that fulfils the vote and allows us to come together again as a country.Mrs May refused to be drawn on whether she would stand down if she lost the vote, despite being repeatedly pressed during her end of summit press conference.I am focusing on ensuring that I make a case for this deal to MPs, she said.Mrs May also admitted she did not share the sadness expressed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after the UK\u0027s exit from the EU.Asked if she felt sad, the Prime Minister said: No, but I recognise that others do. I recognise some European leaders are sad at this moment.But also some people back home in the UK are sad at this moment.Mrs May refused to be drawn on whether she would stand down if she lost the vote (Image: PHILIPPE LOPEZAFPGetty Images)The way Iook at it is that it\u0027s for us now to move on to the next stage.I\u0027m full of optimism about the future of our country. I believe that we can with this good deal with the EU we will remain friends and neighbours.We are leaving the EU but we are not leaving Europe. We will continue to have that good, close partnership and relationship with countries within the EU.During her press conference, Mrs May said: I believe there should not be that second referendum, we gave the choice to the British people, they voted, they voted to leave the EU, I think we should now deliver on that.She added: They\u0027d (the public) expect Parliament to vote on the deal as it is presented.Asked if she would stand down if the deal is voted down in the Commons, she replied: I am focusing on ensuring that I make a case for this deal to MPs and I think the point that Jean-Claude Juncker was making, that\u0027s been reiterated by others was that if people think somehow there\u0027s another negotiation to be done that\u0027s not the case.This is a deal that\u0027s the result of what has been tough and difficult negotiations over a significant period of time and as has been said this is the deal that\u0027s on the table, this is the best possible deal, it\u0027s the only possible deal.By yesterday, more than 90 Tory MPs had publicly threatened to vote against Mrs May\u0027s deal.Former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, who Downing Street aides had hoped to win over, yesterday said it would be very, very difficult to support the Prime Minister\u0027s deal arguing far too much has been given to the EU.He told Sky News\u0027s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: Well I don\u0027t want to stay in the EU. I campaigned and voted to leave the EU. I don\u0027t believe that, so far, this deal delivers on what the British people really voted for, take back control of your borders, your laws, your money. I think it has ceded too much control.In another blow to the Prime Minister, former Tory leader Lord Howard also joined the ranks of those opposing her deal yesterday.It\u0027s not a deal I can support.It\u0027s not a deal that is a good deal for the UK in several respects, but the one sticking point that I have relates to the arrangements for leaving the backstop, he said.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersAs members of the European Union we had a unilateral, untrammelled right to leave under Article 50 which we are exercising.Under the backstop arrangements we could only leave with the permission of the European Union.That seems to me to be an absolute negation of taking control, that would put us in a worse position than we are now.And a senior Labour MP yesterday dampened the hopes of Tory whips that a significant number of opposition MPs in Leave-voting regions of the country could be won over to back the deal.Backbencher Lisa Nandy said: There\u0027s been no attempt to reach out to Labour MPs like me.It\u0027s just too big a gamble for MPs like me to take with our constituents\u0027 futures.Asked if she would be supporting the deal, she said: Well I\u0027d hoped that it would be, but in all honesty no it\u0027s not and it\u0027s inconceivable now that when this comes before Parliament in just a few days\u0026rsquo time that I\u0027ll be voting for it. I won\u0027t be voting to support the Withdrawal Agreement.

It comes just hours after Mrs May returned from Brussels where EU leaders took just 40 minutes to sign off her deal after 20 painstaking months of talks. But agreeing a Brexit deal with the EU may have been the easy part for the Tory leader as getting it through a ided parliament at home could be an altogether tougher battle. And for now, the odds look stacked against her with criticism of the deal from all sides, including the Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos DUP which is currently propping up her minority government.                \u0027Blame Macron!\u0027 Brexiteer MP attacks May deal which will shackle UK                Pound LIVE: GBP Sterling holding ground against euro as May preparesA \u0026lsquomeaningful\u0026rsquo vote is set to take place in the Commons on December 12.Amid widespread opposition, Mrs May will today tell the Commons with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available.\u0026nbspShe will warn MPs rejecting her Brexit deal will be risky and lead to \u0026ldquoision and uncertainty.READ MORE: EU leaders approve Brexit deal - what happens next?\u0026nbspBrexit latest: Theresa May is on a 17-day battle to get her deal through Parliament  (Image:  )In her Commons statement the Prime Minister will say: Our duty as a Parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.There is a choice which MPs will have to make.

And does so in a way that also protects jobs, that also gives security to EU citizens.1.37pm update: Hard border on the island of Ireland cannot be avoided through goodwill and wishful thinking - Ireland\u0027s premierLeo Varadkar said the current draft Brexit deal on the table is the only way of preventing a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The Taosieach said the heads of the 27 EU member states agreed not to speculate on a no-deal scenario, but he added that Ireland and the EU is making preparations for it.Speaking at a Project Ireland event in Dublin after returning from Brussels where the EU and the UK Government backed the draft withdrawal text, Mr Vardakar said it makes sense for everyone to agree to the current deal.He said: We need to be realistic here, there is no country in the EU that can be fully prepared for a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspTheir (British Parliament) decision on whether or not to accept the deal that had been negotiated by their government is a matter for their Parliament, so we don\u0027t want to be counter-productive by being seen to interfere with the of decisions of the British Parliament.You could imagine the reaction that might happen in Ireland if you had politicians from Spain or Britain or Denmark coming to Ireland and telling us how we should vote in a parliamentary vote.1.01pm update: Boris Johnson proposes NEW Brexit dealThe former foreign secretary and leading personality of the Leave campaign branded Mrs May\u0026rsquos deal a \u0026ldquodisaster for this country.Arguing it will keep Britain linked to the European Union for years to come, Mr Johnson said the best possible alternative to this agreement is to \u0026ldquobank what is sensible in it and chuck the rest.He wrote in the Daily : \u0026ldquoThe way out of this mess is clear.

However, there seem to be numerous pieces of evidence which suggest it is very possible. Many researchers agree that in the distant past, electricity was widely utilised in the land of the Pharaohs, with the Baghdad Battery being one of the most discussed examples of such advanced technology.

High tech vehicle symbols discovered                Egypt pyramid SHOCK: Extraordinary clue revealed by wisdom keeperIn 2009 Netflix documentary \u0026ldquoThe Pyramid Code, scientists discuss whether the battery is evidence of the ancient Egyptians having electricity.The battery is a set of three artefacts found together: a ceramic pot, a tube of copper and a rod of iron.Although it was discovered in Khujut Rabu, Iraq, many believe it was originally designed in Egypt.It was hypothesised by some researchers that the object functioned as a galvanic cell, possibly used for electroplating, or some kind of electrotherapy.  (Image: Getty)The narrator then explains that people were aware of the chemical source of current (CSC) in ancient times before claiming that electricity was generated and widely used.A careful examination of Egyptian history immediately reveals the sophistication in perfect illumination.No soot has been found in the corridors of the pyramids or the tombs of the kings because these areas were lit using electricity, the documentary adds.Relief carvings could also show that the Egyptians used hand-held torches powered by cable-free sources.The arc lamp used in the Lighthouse of Alexandria is further evidence that electricity might have been used in ancient Egypt.  (Image: Google)The energy required to power the Lighthouse of Alexandria for 24 hours a day could only have been supplied by a regular electrical source.Moreover, experiments with models of the Baghdad Battery have produced between 3 and 5 volts.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451029522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"single mums on universal credit could jump the queue and get extra handouts amber rudd says","story":"The new Work and Pensions boss says she would review the five-week wait, payments for housing, and repayment of loans in a sure sign that more changes are on the way.But she said she wanted to focus on the impacts on particularly single mothers.In an interview with Sky News she said: Im going to specically look at how Universal Credit impacts women...

But when an American ­missionary called John Chau, pictured, heard about how the ancient tribesman on the remote North Sentinel Island between India and Burma were notoriously hostile to outsiders, he decided he must pay them a visit.He knew, of course, that the th Century explorer Marco Polo had described them as cannibals.He also knew that when a rescue helicopter ­hovered overhead after the  tsunami, they threw spears at it.But he was doing God’s work. It was important work. To convert the heathen.So off he set with hope in his heart and a song in his lungs.He paid fishermen to take him as close as they dared to the island and then he did the last bit of the journey in a canoe.Eventually, he reached the beach where he was promptly hit by an avalanche of arrows. Which killed him.And the incident can’t be investigated becausea policeman lands there, he will immediately be eaten.NO one knows how the Starship Enterprise works. Or why the crew doesn’t fall over when it suddenly goes into warp drive – not even Zoe Saldana .It’s always been billed as ­science fiction. But now two boffins in America have turned it into science fact. They’ve built a plane that has no moving parts, inset. It uses electronic trickery, nitrogen and ordinary air to get thrust from what’s known as an “ionic wind”.And it works. It actually flew for  metres before it crashed into a wall.That doesn’t sound like much.But let’s not forget that the Wright brothers only ­managed  metres on their first flight.

With two exceptions.People who drop litter and people who block yellow boxes at junctions.They should be ­executed, on the spot. By sniper fire.It turns out, however, that only two cities in ­Britain enforce yellow box laws with one, London, saying that they are ­handing out £ fines as fast as the postman can run. Almost  people a DAY are being fined at one junction alone.Offenders say they can’t help it and that poor traffic light sequencing is to blame. Hmmm. Well let’s impose my death penalty idea and seethey’re quite so willing to flout the law then.WE were always told the HS high-speed rail link would be worth it, as it could cut the journey time between London and the North West by as much as  or  seconds.But now, engineers are saying that trains will not be able to go through the tunnels as quickly as they’d hoped.So actually, ­Manchester United fans ­wanting to travel from where they live, in ­London, to Old ­Trafford may in fact be better off using a horse.MANY people ran into the street screaming this week when it was revealed that one of ­Britain’s top bosses was paid £million in the last financial year.And what’s more, it turns out that the boss in question, Denise Coates, pictured, from the gaming ­company Bet, was paid £million the year before. That’s nearly half a ­BILLION in two years.Even the Tories were cross, with one MP saying that no one in the country should be allowed to earn more than a million a year.Well, let’s think about that shall we Mrs Coates, who started the business herself, has donated more than £million to ious charities. She’s helped the victims of cancer, typhoons and even gave £, to a school in Stoke so they could help youngsters in Sierra Leone.She sounds to me like a very sound, very big-hearted and very good woman.And then there’s the small matter of how much tax she pays.As she still lives here, quietly, in Cheshire, it’ll be around  per cent of what she earns.Which means in the past two years, she’ll have given the Treasury about £million.That’s one taxpayer coughing up enough to build eight secondary schools.Which means she’s done a damn site more for the country and the world than some bitter and twisted MP who just wants to get her name in the papers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British people will rightly expect a goodon that money.Yet, when it comes to taking back democratic control over our laws, the final terms are worse than membership of the EU.We would still be bound indefinitely by EU-imposed rules on customs, trade, employment, social policy and tax – with no say over those rules, and no ability to exit the regime.The government rightly resisted pressure to accept Free Movement of people from EU countries, to allow us to regain control over our immigration policy.But, the current deal leaves it open for the EU to refuse a permanent trade deal unless we cave in during the second phase of negotiations, after March.As for the dream of a global Britain trading more energetically from Asia to Latin America, the EU has tied our hands, hobbling those ambitions.Much has been made of the Northern Ireland Protocol. No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

ago and now her son, , has fallen ill with the same condition.But his we, who genes were clear of the genetic mutation, also died from the disease, according to The Times.The woman, who was in her seventies when she died, was diagnosed with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease before medics linked the condition with her son.It wasn’t until her sons diagnosis they realised she contracted the usually inherited condition when she was pregnant.Doctors believe the woman almost certainly caught the disease from her baby through foetal cells carrying the same toxic proteins travelling through the placenta and into her body.The toxins then lodged themselves into her brain and began destroying its cells.Ausrine Areskeviciute, a researcher at the Danish Reference Centre for Prion Diseases in Copenhagen University Hospital, said: “We already know that when a woman is pregnant cells from the baby travel across the placenta and travel around her body, lodging in ious organs.“However, in this case the foetus carried the mutation for the misfolded proteins, and its cells may also have had misfolded proteins when they got into the mothers body, triggering the process that led to her death years later.”Her son is still alive, but as there are no treatments for the disease his prognosis isn’t known, Areskeviciute added.Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseis a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain.It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time, according to the NHS.Symptoms include memory loss loss of intellect changes in personality loss of balance and coordination slurred speech problems with vision and blindness abnormal jerking movements and progressive loss of brainand mobility.Most people who have the disease die within a year of diagnosis.It’s caused by abnormal proteins called prions, which accumulate at high levels and cause irreversible damage to the nerve cells in the brain.The prions are infectious, but cannot be treated like normal bacteria.They’re resistant to heat and radiation that normally kills bacteria as well as being resistant to antibiotics.Sporadic CJD disease is the most common type of the condition, but is still incredibly rare and affects only one or two people in every million each year in the UK.Most cases of sporadic CJD occur in adults aged between  and .On average, symptoms develop between the ages of  and .In , there were

Blanca last year.Now, dissatisfied with how work is progressing, he has further damaged his fragile peace with the West by slamming the impact of US-led sanctions.It comes just days after he supervised North Koreas first weapons test in a year, trialling a high-tech tactical weapon.Visiting the beach resort in Wonsan, on the reclusive countrys east coast, Kim Jong-un called construction a decisive battle for the authority of his party.The hostile forces are foolishly keen on vicious sanctions to stand in our way, he said.Kim went on to say continuing construction of the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area in such a dficult and tense situationwould represent an on-target impact on hostile forces.He also demanded a number of new additions to the project, ordering more hotels and inns with over  floors as well as a large water park and an all-event stadium.They will be made to clearly see how our country has built its strength hundreds of times defying hardship, he said.North Korea expert Markus Bell, of the University of Sheffield, said the resort would be of little benefit to most people living under the Kim regime.Of course ordinary North Koreans are unlikely to ever be able to make use of such facilities, he said.They are constructed as both a rest and relaxation destination for Korean Workers Party elites and as a magnet for foreign, specically Chinese, capital.”Chinese tourists account for roughly  per cent of all foreign visitors to the North, its estimated.Dr Bell added: Kim has promised two things to the North Korean people: a strong military and an improved economy.North Koreas recently acquired nuclear capabilities mean that Kim feels more secure than he did before and able to go ahead with projects like the beach resort.We shouldnt underestimate the symbolic value of these projects.They can be pointed to by the North Korean government and its supporters as signs that the young leader is set on making North Korea a normal state.North Koreas delegation to Spain reportedly travelled from Barcelona through Valencia to Alicante in June last year, looking for inspiration.Its was reported they were amazed by the dimensions of Benidorms towers and holiday parks.Work on the Wonsan-Kalma resort began in January and pictures from Kims visit show that the skeletons of its many hotels are largely complete.The dictator has demanded popular heroism and indomitable fighting spirit from his workers to ensure his deadline of October , , is met.Wonsan beach was the launch site for a failed missile test on March  last year, while the neighbouring airfield was used for a successful test two months later on May .The beach also hosted North Koreas largest-ever artillery drill in April , showcasing  large-calibre self-propelled guns."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451946067.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry arrives zambia tour","story":"The Duke of Sussex

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took just  minutes for the PMs Brexit plan to be agreed by the EU in Brussels yesterday, but getting it past MPs back home will be a far tougher task. By last night,  Tory rebels and the DUPs  MPs had warned they would vote against the compromise proposals, which critics say leaves Britain bound to European rules with no say over them. But the Prime Minister staked her future on the pact as she refused to rule out resigning - or the government collapsing –it is defeated. And the desperate PM today embarks on a two-week campaign that will pit her own MPs against the British public - by warning they have a “duty” to back her deal “in the national interest”. MPs want Mrs May to reopen talks with Brusselsit is voted down. But EU chiefs declared her pact the “only deal possible” with “no plan B”. And Mrs May will tell the Commons today: “I can say with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available. “There is a choice MPs will have to make. We can back this deal... or go back to square one. It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty.” Among those bidding to block the deal is Brexiteer John Hayes, recently given a knighthood by Mrs May in what many saw as a bribe to win his backing. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded her fudged plans a miserable failure that his party would vote against. His colleague Lisa Nandy said it was inconceivable she would back the deal. DUP leader Arlene Foster insisted there were no circumstances in which her  MPs will back the deal - and said she will review her poundbillion pact propping up the Toriesit goes through. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt underlined Mrs Mays high-stakes gamble by warning there is a fear the Government could collapsethe deal is rejected in a Commons vote between December  and . He said: Its not possible to rule out anything.  Former PM Tony Blair insisted the deal was as dead as a dodo and urged EU leaders to come up with a fresh plan. But Brussels bosses declared Mrs Mays pact was the only one possible after she held talks with European Council chief Donald Tusk and others. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: If the House [of Commons] say no, we would have no deal. Dutch PM Mark Rutte added: There is no Plan B. If anyone thinks by voting No something better would come out of it, they are wrong. Lithuanias PM Dalia Grybauskait said there are at least four possible scenarios which may include afor the vote of the people. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here.  As the threat of no deal loomed, reports emerged that a gang of five Cabinet ministers including Philip Hammond are prepared to quitthe PM tries to leave without a pact. The Chancellor is said to have joined Amber Rudd, David Lidington, Greg Clark and David Gauke, plus the DUP, in discussing a Plan B or mass resignationsthe deal is defeated. Reports claimed it involves the Norway option of staying in the European Economic Area - which would contradict the PMs pledge to end free movement. A source close to the Chancellor branded the reports fake news but DUP leader Arlene Foster did not deny them. She said: Were talking to everybody across government.   Mrs May remained embroiled in a row with Tories over her capitulation on Gibraltar. In a bid to get Spain to sign off on the deal, she agreed the Rock may not be part of a future trade pact. MP Nadine Dorries said: Shes abandoned Northern Ireland, now Gibraltar. Its beyond words how bad this is. Mrs May insisted policy had not changed – and was backed by a senior EU diplomat, who said Spains behaviour was outrageous” and other nations were irritated. The diplomat told the Mirror: “I hope they havent made it more dficult for May in Parliament. She has it dficult enough already. If that tips it over the balance, that will be very unfortunate. French president Emmanuel Macron hit back after Mrs May said her deal sets us free of the Common Fisheries Policy for good. He revealed he will seek access to British waters for French fishermen as part of trade talks - or threaten to keep the UK trapped in EU customs rules indefinitely. Mr Macron said: All our fishermen will be protected. And the EU yesterday agreed a fishing deal, by December , must build on existing reciprocal access and quota shares.

The G summit will kick off from Thursday night in a moment that is sure to capture the bizarre times in which we live. The USs Trump and Russias Putin are both pariahs with many of the nations - though in totally dferent ways, of course. And Theresa May will be looking for some much-needed solidarity over Brexit. Here are the dates, timings, and other details you need to know about the big bash.  The G - which stands for Group of  - is a gathering of the biggest financial superpowers in the world. It was formed in  to broaden out the G and consists of  countries, plus the European Union. It has become they key forum for world leaders to meet, battle each others egos and discuss pressing issues of the day. In  the members represented % of the entire worlds economy, two-thirds of its population and % of its trade.  It is taking place in Buenos Aires. It is being held there because Argentina holds the rotating Presidency of the group. When is the G Summit   The G leaders summit is held once a year, and this years event is happening on Friday  November and Saturday  December. What is the agenda and timings   The event kicks off with a working dinner of finance ministers on the Thursday night. Leaders will arrive from .pm UK time on Friday, followed by opening remarks by the Argentine President Mauricio Macri at .pm UK time and a cultural event with partners at the citys Colon Theatre. Working sessions will continue on Saturday until .pm UK time, when Macri will give a press conference followed by other leaders . Leaders partners - including of course First Lady Melania Trump - have their own agenda. They will visit Villa Ocampo, former home of the writer Victoria Ocampo, on Friday morning followed by the Museum of Latin American Art on Saturday morning. Who are the members of the G  Argentina Australia Brazil Canada China France Germany India Indonesia Italy Japan South Korea Mexico Russia Saudi Arabia South Africa Turkey United Kingdom United States European UnionWhat are the key issues on the table   The summit will be the first time Theresa May has come face to face with Russias Vladimir Putin since the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. The incident killed Dawn Sturgess, a member of the public who came into contact with the Novichok, and sparked an international incident. Putin is also likely to face pressure over his support for the Syrian regime and aggressive military presence near the Ukraine border. But much of the focus will be on Donald Trump who dominates international summits through sheer force of personality. Including chumming up to Vladimir Putin while blasting allies like Emmanuel Macron.  The US President has threatened or launched trade wars against many of the other G nations so expect that to be on the agenda. He could also come under fire for axing the deal that lted sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation winding down its nuclear programme. Last but not least is Brexit. The meeting comes midway through a two-week push by Theresa May for MPs to back her deal before a vote in Parliament. Expect her to try and get supportive statements from fellow leaders - including Shinzo Abe of Japan, whose name featured on a leaked No plan of people who could be rallied behind the deal.

The Prime Minister is frantically trying to sell her deal and sees a primetime Sunday night debate as a way to persuade the public. Jeremy would relish a head-to-head debate with Theresa May about her botched Brexit deal and the future of the country, a Labour spokesman said. Today a spokesman for the Prime Minister refused to deny the plans.If agreed the show could happen on Sunday  December - days before the crucial Commons vote. The debate would form part of the PMs national offensive with speeches planned on dferent aspects of the deal in all four nations of the country in the coming days.  The reports come despite chicken Mrs May ducking calls for TV debates during last years general election. At the time she dismissed the value of TV debates sayingI don’t think people get much out of seeing politicians having a go at each other and said Mr Corbyn ought to be paying a little more attention to thinking about Brexit negotiations. But the Prime Minister is now relying on winning over the public in a bid to convince wavering MPs to back her. On Monday afternoon she will tell a hostile House of Commons with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available. The Prime Minister, who will chair a meeting of her Cabinet on Monday morning, will warn rejecting her deal will open the door to more ision and uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail. At a historic summit in Brussels on Sunday, the leaders of the remaining  member states took less than  minutes to approve the deal.  Following the announcement European Commission president insisted that the deal was the UKs only option. On Monday morning Jean Claude-Juncker insisted again that there will be no more negotiation.

She has already started a campaign of selling her deal directly to the public in the hope their support can win round MPs opposed to the plan before the Commons vote, expected in the week beginning December . In her Commons statement the Prime Minister will say: Our duty as a Parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.  There is a choice which MPs will have to make. We can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future of opportunity and prosperity for all our people. Or this House can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one ... It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail. She will say that the national interest is clear and the British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum. Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson branded the Prime Ministers deal a disaster and a humiliation for the UK.

More than  Tories have rejected the deal, with opposition parties - and Mrs Mays allies in the DUP - also set to oppose it. Early December: Theresa May tours UK with two-week campaign to sell her deal directly to the British public.  December: A vote in the House of Commons is expected on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. Writing in the Daily , deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds demanded the Government go back to the negotiating table rather than waste any more time putting forward  choices.

Its not a deal, its not what anyone voted for, andyou had been paying attention youd know it was never going to be.Every journalist, every commentator, every politician and every bloke down the pub or caller to radio shows who uses words like deal, leaving the EU in March  or honouring the referendum result needs to JUST. SHUT. UP.Im talking to you, Theresa May. And you, the BBC. And the new Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay who in his first public utterance on the matter managed to say a good deal that brings us the benefits of Brexit with a straight face. None of what theyre telling you is true. And theres another decade of this yet, folks.The two years weve just experienced of political chaos, resignations, backstabbing, bitchery and a total lack of political bandwidth for fixing all the things that are broken were NOT Brexit negotiations.They were negotiations about how we start negotiating. They were not the final hurdle before we leave, but the warm-up before we get in the starting blocks.  Everyone - Leave or Remain - who waves the -page transition agreement in the air and declares this is not what anyone voted for! is entirely right. What people voted for is still  years down the road. After the actual negotiations. Britain has done three things: . Voted for Brexit . Given notice that it will Brexit . Agreed what will happen while it discusses Brexit What it has not done, and is not about to do any time soon, is any actual Brexiting.  Barclay claimed in a newspaper article today the agreement is what people voted for in  - and that is what this government will deliver. With the best will in the world, hes talking bollocks. People voted to Leave or Remain, and neither is happening yet. And whatever is achieved at the end of all this, its likely going to be not this government, or the next, but the one after that which actually gets to deliver anything. Because as he very well knows, the next stage is sitting down with the EU to discuss what happens on trade, freedom of movement, visas, tarfs and the land border we share on the island of Ireland, and which most voters and politicians cheerfully forgot about until recently. Are you bored of the failed coups  The uncivil wrangling, the backbench blackmail, the -hour knee-jerk TV coverage of things that have not happened, are not happening and will not happen, but are being briefed to political hacks anyway  Well, youve most likely got another decade of it to go. Everyone who campaigned for Brexit knew this, and didnt tell you. Everyone who campaigned for Remain knew it too, and thought youd rather hear about World War Three. Had they only said that Nigel Farage would be resigning, leading, threatening, and resigning again for the rest of our natural lives, theres a chance we would have realised Brexit was a drawn-out torture that carried a serious risk of boring the nation to death. Theresa May has shown herself to be astonishingly resilient, able to shoulder dficult treaties over the line despite a dozen knives in her back. But not only do none of us want to see her struggle under that kind of pressure for many more years,she does struggle on everyone might just stop paying attention. We are already starting to tune out the greatest constitutional change in our letimes. There is a danger we will let politicians spiral into self-regarding spats, and cease voting while they cease trying to improve health, education, the high street, small business, homelessness, and every other thing thats in crisis.  When people disengage from politics, bad things happen. Communities that do so become distrustful, are trodden on, and riot. If a whole country does it, only the lunatics are left to vote and they usually choose the angriest halfwit they can find. Ask the USAyou dont believe me. But while we wait for that to unfold, we can appreciate those bits of Brexit that are simpler and within our grasp - a solid  years in which the English can legitimately despise the French, the Scots can threaten border raids and the Irish offer just about everyone outside for a fight. We can fall back on our tribalism, descend into sniping xenophobia, and talk about how its all bullying by the Germans, bloody Fritz, what they need is a good war, thatll show em. When you see that happening, remember this: thats how weve been dealing with Europe for , years. Its what we did after the Romans invaded, its what the Normans did after they invaded. Its what we did while we were in the EU, and its what well miss the most when andwe finally get around to leaving it.  Having promised unicorns, talked about unicorns and finally agreed a process by which we can discuss the delivery of unicorns, Parliament is now arguing about whether we shouldnt go back to the unicorn shop and ask for a dferent one. Its the one thing the Tories and Labour are united on - that Theresas agreement is so bad well never get a unicorn, and whats really needed after two years of argy-bargy is more argy-bargy about what well do while waiting for the unicorn to turn up. Its more than likely, when the postman fails to bring a horned magical creature before , that Europe will be blamed again. Frankly, we dont know how to blame anyone , and wed never blame ourselves. The only alternative to a decade of self-deception iswere all somehow forced, by Parliamentary process or a massive swing in public opinion, to think afresh about what we want our future to be.  If we vote to Leave under Theresas agreement, we retain the stability of being within the EU but without a rebate or voting rights. If we vote to Leave without a deal, the financial services sector is destroyed, tax revenues slump by billions of pounds, and Gideons austerity measures will look like a day at the beach. Andwe vote to Remain, wed just look like pillocks. Which is the thing all the politicians, reporters and campaigners seem to be most bothered about. If that is their main concern, doesnt that prove that the whole thing is a boring, worthless, exercise in futility  Only a pillock worries about what the French think. Lets just not be pillocks."},{"url":null,"title":"shocking climate statistics reveal how","story":"NewsShocking climate statistics reveal UK temperature is set to rise by .C by It is the most comprehensive picture yet of how the UK climate could change over the next centuryShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsHot summers like  could become the norm \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShocking climate statistics reveal how temperature is set to rise by .C by  according to new research.

Even in the lowest-emission scenario, average annual temperatures are expected to be up to . degrees Celsiushigher by the end of the century. In the highest-emissions scenario, summer temperatures could be up to .Chigher by  and winters up to .Chigher. The chance of a summer as hot as this year is about  percent by .This summer was the joint hottest on record, when a six-week spell of hot weather saw daytime temperatures in many parts of the country regularly over C .   The report said average summer rainfall could fall by up to  percent by  and winter rainfall could be up to % lower in winter. Meanwhile, sea levels could rise by up to . metresby , which increases the risk of flooding. Sea levels are projected to rise over the st century and beyond under all emission scenarios meaning we can expect to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels around the UK coastline, the Met Office said in a statement. The UK Climate Projection has illustrated a range of future climate scenarios based on dferent rates of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere stretching to . The government say it is the most comprehensive picture yet of how climate could change over the next century.Theresa Mays Brexit deal would cost Britain poundbn a year by The warning comes on the th anniversary of the UKs Climate Change Act - the worlds first law to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Environment Secretary says that since  the UK has slashed emissions by more than %.  But campaigner say the government is failing on climate change with its relentless pursuit of fracking, airport expansion, and road building. Speaking today from the Science Museum in London, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said: “This cutting-edge science opens our eyes to the extent of the challenge we face, and shows us a future we want to avoid. “The UK is already a global leader in tackling climate change, cutting emissions by more than  per cent since  – but we must go further. “By having this detailed picture of our changing climate, we can ensure we have the right infrastructure to cope with weather extremes, homes and businesses can adapt, and we can make decisions for the future accordingly.” Emi Murphy, climate change campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: The human cost of climate change, both in England and around the world, is already devastating. Its the most vulnerable communities paying the highest price, while the UK government fails to commit to the policies needed to avoid climate chaos. The Climate Change Act was a truly remarkable political achievement that has driven cuts in UK emissions.But dire warnings from scientists demonstrate how further and faster action is essential to prevent complete climate breakdown. Instead, with its relentless pursuit of fracking, airport expansion, and road building, our government is failing us on climate change. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas called the Secretary of States speech vague and called for parliament to set up a select committee to look at climate change and put pressure on ministers.These projections paint a devastating picture of what climate breakdown means for the UKwe continue down the path were on.MichaelGoves vague talk of mitigating the worst impacts of floods, droughts and storms are far from reassuring. Its increasingly clear the Government isnt going to embark on the urgent economic transformation we need to secure our futures.Its now up to Parliament to create a Select Committee on Climate Change to pile pressure on ministers and chart a course out of this crisis.Those MPs must urgently begin drafting legislation to impose absolute limits on our use of resources and outlaw wasteful product designs.They must measure the Government’s success according to peoples quality of le and the health of our ecosystems – not economic growth.And they must set out binding plans to ensurepeople can thrive as we reimagine our society.

The economy will be .% less valuable - poundbn a year by  - under Mays pact compared tothe nation stayed in the EU, a leading economic think tank said. Sir Vince Cable of the anti-Brexit Peoples Vote campaign, which paid for the study, branded the deal an absolute mess and called for a second referendum. The Lib Dem leader said: “This is a million miles from what the Brexiteers promised two years ago and will create decades of uncertainty.” On Sunday two cabinet ministers failed to say whether or not the UK would be better off under Theresa Mays Brexit deal or staying in the EU. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt damned it with faint praise saying it “mitigates most of the negative impacts” of leaving the EU. He added: I think we will not be signicantly worse off or better off, but what it does mean is that we get our independence back, our sovereignty back. While Housing Secretary James Brokenshire refused to directly address the question. He told Sky Newss Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “It does give effect to the vote of the British people, and therefore yes, things have now changed,” he said. “We’ve had that referendum, we’ve looked towards a future outside of theEuropean Union, and this is a good deal for our country.”   Todays report by the National Institute for Economic and Social Researchis the first study of how the Prime Ministers offer compares to cancelling Brexit.

Under an orderly no deal Brexit GDP would be .% lower, pushing the cost up to pound, per person, the study claimed.  If the backstop is activated to continue EU customs rules in the UK, GDP would be .% weaker – a cost of pound per head, the study said. The think tank claimed the drop was “largely because higher impediments to services trade make it less attractive to sell services from the UK.” It added: “This discourages investment in the UK and ultimately means that UK workers are less productive than they would have beenthe UK had stayed in the EU.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror theresa mays absolute","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Theresa Mays “absolute certainty” is a last political gambleThe Prime Minister must recognise that she needs to quickly convert her many opponents – on both sides of the houseShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsopinionTheresa May is going into the Parliamentary discussions on her draft Brexit plan with an unjustied “absolute certainty” \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May has campaigned like this before, and it didn’t end well.

But that does not mean her work is done. The Prime Minister is now trying to win support at home for a vote by MPs, but faces an uphill struggle. There are already  MPs who plan to vote against the proposal -  Tory rebels and the  DUP MPs she normally relies on for support So where have we got to and what happens next  What has been agreed The Brexit deal was agreed by EU leaders in  minutes yesterday at a special summit in Brussels.There are two parts to the package: the withdrawal agreement which sets out the terms of the orce and the political declaration, which is the route map for the UK and EUs future trade and security relationship. This deal now has to be agreed by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament before we leave on March  next year. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves.Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstopEuropean courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. When will parliament vote on the final Brexit deal  Theresa May has a frantic two weeks in which to sell her deal to MPs and the public. The Commons is expected to vote on the withdrawal agreement during the week beginning Monday, December .The PM says this is the only deal on offer and it is a choice between her plans, no deal or no Brexit at all.Why is the deal so unpopular  Conservative Leave MPs say the withdrawal agreement leaves us bound by EU rules and regulations with no say over them. Many Tory Remain MPs, such as Jo Johnson, share this concern. Brexiteers are most exercised by the Irish backstop which promises no hard border between Northern Ireland and Irish Republic. This says that,no other solution can be found, then Northern Ireland will remain within the orbit of the EU. The DUP says the Irish backstop would result in a border down the Irish Sea - effectively splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - and are also refusing to back the deal. What does Labour say about the Brexit deal  Jeremy Corbyn says the agreement fails to meet its six tests. These are a deal that provides the exact same benefits of the single market and the customs union, a strong and collaborative relationship with the EU, protects workers rights and environmental standards, a fair system of migration, protects national security and delivers for the nations and regions of the EU. While Mrs Mays deal fulfils some of these demands it does not give access to the single market and the customs union, while the section on workers rights is time-limited. Labour says it would renegotiate a better outcome. The question isthe EU, which says Mays deal is the only one on the table, would be willing. As for former PM Tony Blair, he insisted the deal was as dead as a dodo and urged EU leaders to come up with a fresh plan. Can Theresa May get her Brexit deal through Parliament   At the moment it is hard to see where the numbers are. The vast majority of the Labour Party, the SNP and the Lib Dems will vote against as well the  DUP MPs. So far as many as  Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Government. Downing Street is now in a race against time to get as many MPs as possible to change their mind. Mrs May is trying to appeal over Parliaments head by appealing to the public that her deal is in the national interest in the hope voters will put pressure on their MPs. Butthis tactic fails she could be forced to look at rewriting the withdrawal agreement or adding some last-minute caveats. What happensparliament votes against the Brexit deal  We are in uncharted territory. The PM,she survives, could submit the agreement to a second vote of MPs. Another option is the Commons votes to send Mrs May back to the negotiating table. But, with time running out, this would require extending Article , which in turn needs the approval of all  EU states. There could be another general election but Tories will not want to risk any move that could allow Jeremy Corbyn into No . Another possibility is MPs decide to send the issue back to the people by holding a second referendum. Or we crash out without a deal.

A new list of second-hand vehicles also shows their most common faults and when they become a problem for drivers across the UK. The findings are based on a number of key indicators, including the numbers of claims against faults and how much each car costs, report The Sun . A spokesman for Warranty Wise, who conducted the research, said: This data is derived from real cases and genuine warranty claims making it the most trustworthy information a used car buyer can get. “We are not suggesting, by any means, that these problems are guaranteed to occur, but it is the sole reason a warranty exists.” The most reliable brand is the Honda with a % reliability rating - while Seat is the least reliable with %. As can be seen in the following list, three Vauxhall models are deemed to be the most unreliable, while surprising entrants in the form of high end cars from Mercedes and Range Rover also are beset with issues. THE  MOST UNRELIABLE CARS . Renault Clio   The Clio is of the most common cars on UK roads - but it is still susceptible to big electrical faults and ignition coil problems. The most expensive common problem with the car is gearbox faults which on average cost pound to repair. . Fiat  The Fiat  is another very common car on UK roads, but is very prone to gearbox problems. The Italian car also suffers with problems arising from the suspension, electrical faults and also clutch faults.   Problems start to arise with car when it is close to eight years old. . Seat Ibiza The Spanish manufacturer is popular with motorists - but Warranty Wise say most common problem is with the engine and will cost motorists a huge pound.    Other common faults with the car include issues with the ignition coil, turbo faults and gearbox faults which all cost more than pound to repair. Normally problems start to pile up on Ibiza drivers when the car is nine years and three months old. . Mini Cooper The Mini Cooper is one of the UKs most iconic cars due to its association with the classic film The Italian Job - but they have a number of issues which do not come with mini repair costs. The most common problem with the Mini Cooper is a clutch fault which typically sets motorists back approximately pound.   But costly issues such gearbox or engine failures will set motorists back on average a whopping pound. To compound the woe, it normally takes just one-and-a-half years for the problems to pile up. . Mercedes-Benz C-class A Merc is an expensive car to buy, so unsurprisingly it isn’t a cheap car either to fix. The most common fault with the car is an electrical fault which costs on average pound to fix.   Other common problems include sensor faults, suspension faults, engine faults and problems with the alternator. But it does normally take close to a decade for the issues to surface. . Vauxhall Astra Despite being Vauxhalls second best selling model behind the Corsa in the UK - some of the most common faults will set you back a small fortune to repair. The most common warranty claim is for gearbox issues - which cost more than pound, to fix.   Another major problem with car is with engine faults normally costing around pound to repair - alongside electrical and clutch faults. It normally takes nine years and three months for problems to pile up. . Peugeot  French manufacturer Peugeot has a reputation for unreliability. The most common fault with the car includes engine problems, faults with cylinder head gasket, clutch faults, electrical faults and gearbox faults.   The priciest problem with Peugot is engine faults which on average cost owners pound. But it normally takes  years and two months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Insignia This is Vauxhall’s second entry to the list, a popular saloon car with families. Warranty Wise state the biggest problem with the vehicle comes down problems with the steering.   This usually costs around pound to repair but other common faults include engine faults and gearbox faults which typically cost more than pound, to fix. It normally takes seven years and seven months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Zafira Vauxhall makes yet another entry into the list - and the Zafira has been the subject of ious recalls due to fire fears that have been caused in the main by replacement parts. But the most common fault with the car is down to problems with the gearbox which on averages costs more than pound, to repair.   More common issues include clutch faults, problems with ignition coil, alternator and ious electrical faults. It normally takes  years and three months for the problems to develop. . Range Rover Sport A Range Rover Sport does not come cheap, so its unsurprising that the cars most common faults are expensive to fix. Warranty Wise claims the most common fault with the car is its suspension, which on average costs around pound to repair.   More common faults include problems with the alternator, brake faults, electrical faults and EGR Valve faults - and it usually takes around nine years for these problems to build up. For those reasons, it is one of the most unreliable cars on the market.

Excited families queued for up to two hours for Boltons Weekend after they had been promised an ice-skating rink, Christmas stalls, a Santas Grotto, a snow globe and an appearance from Disney characters. But, though kids under  were allowed in for free, adults paid pound on the door or pound in advance to find a filthy grotto and stalls which resembled a jumble sale.The ice rink was actually plastic tiles on which a member of staff sprayed soapy water, Manchester Evening News says.And the snow globe was branded dangerous after it collapsed with children inside.   Claire Cassidy, , went on Saturday with her two-year-old son, two friends and their two children. The angry mother said: There was no Christmas atmosphere, no trees, no music. The advert showed a big ice rink and it turned out to be just plastic tiles and a guy putting down soap. It was filthy. The snow globe was deflated each time kids went in, parents were saying it was dangerous. It was crammed - it was an hour queuing for the globe and about two hours queuing for Santas Grotto.   People who had paid in advance said they were told they wouldnt have to queue. It was a very disappointing experience. Other fuming parents ranted on social media. Sarah Halliday tweeted the photos of the plastic ice rink and deflated snow globe, adding: the most overhyped mis-sold event Ive ever had the displeasure of attending. Another visitor tweeted: We went to Bolton Winter Wonderland yesterday and it was a complete joke! Inside was like a jumble sale and the ice skating was a disgrace and nothing like advertised! I want to claim my money back Jeff Chadburn wrote on Facebook: Did anyone see the magical winter lane highlighted on the map    Felt more Christmassy on my walk around BM bargains. Bar the grotto, which we didnt see, theres nothing in the theme of Christmas or winter at all! On the approach over the bridge you see the struggle of parents with prams evacuating the overly loud fun fair after realising they too had been deceived into thinking this was a child friendly festive day! This event does not live up to the title winter wonderland at all, car boot sale at best. Several people also claimed that a large number of negative reviews had been deleted from the Winter Weekends official Facebook page and that they have not been given a response when asking for refunds. When the Manchester Evening News rang the landline number on the Winter Weekend page, it was out of service.   Organisers have not yet replied to further requests for comment, but event manager Martin Robinson spoke to the Bolton News on Saturday. He acknowledged there had been issues with queuing adding: We had a lot more people turn up than we expected. We have moved the grotto and snow globe around to make queuing easier and get more people through in a better way. This event is fantastic for Bolton. The organisers have tried to bring the local community and businesses together. The response at the event has actually been really positive. Most of the people that went away yesterday were happy.

John McMullan, , said he was shocked by the scores in a recent PIP assessment for his son Declan, , who is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Claiming he faced ignorant questioning, he said he feared what other disabled people might face during their assessments for the benefit, which is replacing Disability Living Allowance. Belfast Live reports that are neurological condition that means he is unable to control his movements despite being fully aware. He requires -hour care for the condition, which was triggered when his brain was starved from oxygen during an eight-minute cardiac arrest when he was .   When John recently received a letter informing him Declan must be reassessed for the new payment, he expected the change would be made without question. He explained: The form was very easy to fill in because Declan cant do anything other than blink. He is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Doctors told us to imagine being buried alive - that is what Locked-in syndrome is. But three weeks later, I received a phone call from an assessor to ask questions. John claimed the assessor, who wanted to see Declan face-to-face, displayed a total ignorance of his condition. He said: In my opinion, I supplied ample evidence of Declans disability but I doubt they actually understood what is on that paper. I dont think the people assessing are fit to be doing it. Declan achieved the full payment but John said he was shocked to see that he did not achieve full points for his daily living needs. He said: Declan cannot eat and is PEG fed yet the assessor only gave him  points out of  for the level of assistance he needs with eating and drinking. He cannot move at all, only blink, yet the assessor gave him just two out of eight points on whether he needs supervision or assistance managing his therapies. He got   for needing assistance making budgeting decisions and just   for needing support in social situations.   If a GP is telling the government somebody is sick, who is an assessor to question the doctors judgement  How can a PIP assessor be properly qualied to override those doctors  Declans team include occupational therapists, social workers, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and psychiatrists. A PIP assessor cant be all of that. I knew Declan was never going to be turned down for PIP. It was just the stupidity of the process and the fact even he did not get full points. Declan is probably one of the most disabled people in Northern Ireland. How disabled do you have to be  John said he was convinced the assessors aimed to get as many people off disability benefit as possible and believed a bonus system made them sales people in reverse. Recalling the year and a half Declan spent in hospital following his cardiac arrest, John said they were devastated to be told he was in a borderline vegetative state.   But the family was delighted to realise he could communicate by blinking. One of the first things Declan told his parents was that he wanted to go home. John recalled: That is when our battles began. We had to fight to have the house sorted out for him and we had to take out a bank loan to buy an accessible vehicle as DLA was not available while he was in hospital. I had to fight for a generator to ensure Declan did not die during an electricity outage. And now PIP. How many times do severely disabled people need to be assessed  If professional people are providing professional evidence is that not good enough  When you are disabled, you dont need to prove you are this disabled. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Department expects the highest standards from Capita, who deliver the PIP Assessment Service and they have to conform to a rigorous set of quality standards set down by the Department. Each disability assessor must have a minimum of two years post registration experience which must be fulfilled within an approved health profession and receive extensive training in line with DfC guidelines before they undertake PIP assessments. “Capita is committed to delivering a high quality and empathetic service for people applying for PIP. Its disability assessors are healthcare professionals with the required skills and knowledge to carry out PIP assessments across Northern Ireland. The PIP assessment looks at how iniduals are able to complete a number of key everyday activities. Within each activity there are a number of descriptors, each representing a ying level of ability to carry out the activity. Iniduals receive a point score for each activity, depending on how well they can carry them out and the help they need to do so which is based on the evidence provided and collected. The guidance which disability assessors and PIP case managers are expected to apply is set out in the PIP Assessment Guide. “A robust complaint process is in place for customers who are unhappy with the service provided by Capita which includes the opportunity to escalate a complaint to the Departmentthey feel it has not been satisfactorily resolved. “The terms and conditions of the contracts of employment for Disability Assessors are a matter for Capita and are not set by the Department. However, the Department understands that an annual quality incentive of pound, is wholly based on the Disability Assessor producing consistent high-quality reports on a timely basis and is not related in any way to decisions on entitlement to PIP. “Decisions on iniduals’ entitlement to PIP are made by the Department. Every claim is considered on an inidual basis, and decisions are made based on the available evidence and the relevant legislation. More people are being awarded PIP at the highest rate of benefit than under DLA.” "},{"url":null,"title":"size 32 hermit who ate","story":"NewsSize  \"hermit\" who ate non-stop for two years after her dad died loses  STONESteph Sykes would gorge on food while watching Netflix but decided to make a major change amid fears she would die youngShareCommentsByRosa McMahonChris kitching:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsSteph Sykes weighed more than st when she was at her heaviest \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA size  woman who became a hermit and ate non-stop for two years after her dad died on Father’s Day has lost an incredible st. Steph Sykes, , swapped being a couch potato and gorging on , calories a day - more than twice the daily limit - for healthy eating and exercise - and is now a size . The administrative assistant teamed up with her mum on a joint diet amid fears that st lb Steph would suffer a terrible fate. Mum Karen Sykes, , persuaded her to join a slimming class with her - where her daughter lost a staggering st lb. Steph has told how she feels like a completely dferent person and almost cant believe her new look when she gazes into the mirror.   The young woman, from Billingham, County Durham, said: “I’m st lb, wearing a size  now and I feel so dferent. “When I was a size , I could only get my clothes from one place online and I’d only leave the house to go to my mums, where Id also lie on the sofa. “Now, when I look in the mirror, I can’t believe it’s me. While admitting that she was always very overweight, Steph said her relationship with food became really toxic after her beloved dad, Alan Sykes, , died suddenly of an aortic aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge which can burst open, or rupture, and lead to bleeding inside the body - on Father’s Day in .   Left completely heartbroken, she recalled: “I was on holiday in Spain with my ex and had sent dad a message that morning, thanking him for how much he had done for me over the years and called him the best dad ever. “But that night, around pm, I got the biggest shock when my mum called saying hed died. It was such a shock and I felt broken. “I was always big. My mum was large and so was my dad, and all I’d really known myself as was a size . “Dads death was when I really started eating on my feelings, though, and my weight became out of control.”  Not working then and eating all the time, Steph barely left the house she shared with her now ex. She only left her bedroom to go to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for more food - stuffing down calorie-laden treats like crisps, biscuits, sweets and takeaways like pizza, curries and ready meals. Steph said: “I became a hermit. I was bored and unhappy and didn’t care what I looked like any more. “Le didn’t really feel worth living to me, so I thought, ‘Who cares that I’m so big ’  “My boyfriend didn’t seem to mind that I was letting myself get so large, so I kept eating and eating, only really going from my bed, to the kitchen to the sofa and the bathroom, apart from once a week, when I went to mums house, five minutes away, where I’d just lie on the sofa, too.” But, her sedentary lestyle - sleeping until pm, then gorging in front of Netflix - became a real concern to her mum, who also works as an administrative assistant. Desperate to help, Karen joined a local Slimming World class in April last year, hoping Steph might follow. Her gamble paid off when, impressed by her mums weight loss and surprised by the meals she could still eat on the programme, Steph joined her for her first class a month later.  Finally sticking to a diet plan and eating proper meals, she began having a yoghurt and two brunch bars for breakfast, salad for lunch and pasta with a fresh sauce for dinner - meaning her excess weight started falling off. By the following October, Steph, who was newly single, had already lost three stone. Now,  months after she first joined Slimming World, Steph is unrecognisable, after losing almost st. She said: “I feel like a completely dferent person.  “I can actually buy clothes in high street shops now and when I look in the mirror, I can’t believe it’s me.” But her tremendous weight loss has left her with a legacy from her fat years, in the form of a stone of unsightly excess skin around her body, which she is now desperate to shed. Steph said: “Through my hard work and determination I know I have achieved so much in my weight loss, but now I want to feel as amazing as I know I deserve to. “It’s everywhere, on my tummy, under my arms, my legs, my back.  “I’ve done all the hard work, but now I need to get rid of this skin to feel my transformation is complete.” But an abdominoplasty, or tummy-tuck, is seen as cosmetic surgery, which is not normally available on the NHS, so she is fundraising on GoFundMe to help meet the pound, cost of surgery. Steph, who shares her weight loss photos on Instagram to help others, said: “I want to be able to date again, and not have to explain why I have all this excess skin, it’s the one last thing left in my massive change. As well as the tummy tuck and bum lt, I need a boob job because I have so much excess skin there, as well as an arm lt too. And her mum is backing her all the way. Karen said: At her biggest, I was frightened for Steph. “I am overweight myself and we are a big family, but Steph was taking it to the next level. “She was getting bigger and bigger and I knew it was not going to end well. I am so proud of Steph, but now she just needs this final bit of help. She has earned whatever help she can get next.

From fantastic half price deals on all Christmas trees,  for  on selected decorations and affordable presents for that perfect someone, there’s something for all the family only fromwilko. What are you waiting for  Find your nearest store at wilko  The study also found Brits are planning on spending an average of pound each on experience-based gts, a rise of  per cent from a year ago. Almost half of Christmas shoppers fear that friends and family will be given the same material gt twice, while  per cent worry that they will struggle to find the perfect present. One in five gt-buyers believe making memories is the most important thing when picking a Christmas present, and  per cent want to make sure the recipient has something to look forward to.   It really is the thought that counts for Brits, as almost six in  feel the thoughtfulness of a present is the main factor to consider when gt-giving. Twenty-five per cent feel sentimental value is also an important factor when receiving a present. Nearly four in  millennials admitted the main reason for buying experiences with their parents was to enjoy quality time together. A further  per cent also admit they consider whether a gt they’re purchasing for a loved one will create exciting content for their social media channels, with millennials aged - more conscious of this than any other age group.  Mathieson added: “The emotion and excitement of giving and receiving an experience is something money can’t buy, particularly when it comes to activities that can be shared. “What’s truly heart-warming though, is that people want to spend more time with their friends and family and are choosing presents they can enjoyed together while also providing something to look forward once the festive season is over.”The research was commissioned by Barclaycard to mark its entertainment partnership with Live Nation which offers exclusive  festival pre-sales with  per cent back at the checkout for each and every pre-sale ticket bought through Barclaycard Entertainment.TOP  - EXPERIENCES BRITS ARE GIFTING THIS CHRISTMAS:Theatre   comedy tickets Spa   beauty treatments Concert tickets Meals out  culinary courses Red letter day vouchers Tourist attractions Sporting event tickets e.g. rugby football match Adventure trips e.g. skying, rock climbing Cultural experiences, e.g. art gallery Historical experiences, e.g. visiting National Trust sites"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast storm diana","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Storm Diana threatens travel chaos - will you be affected The Met Office has warned of a \"major change\" in weather with Storm Diana set to hit the UK with heavy downpours and galesShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video storm-diana-way-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStorm Diana is set to plough into the UK as it moves north through the Atlantic, threatening to cause disruption for millions of Britons. The Met Office is warning of a major change in weather this week as Diana lashes the country with heavy rain and strong gusts of wind. Things will begin to take a turn for the worse on Tuesday before the potentially damaging storm ploughs into western parts of the UK on Wednesday, with every region of the UK expecting rain. It will be wet and windy across much of the country for days with periods of heavy downpours and gales, although it will stay very mild until later in the week. The conditions threaten to disrupt travel and put roads and homes at risk of flooding.  Diana is set to batter the country as the Met Office warns that two-third of Britons have been caught out by recent severe weather. Cold winds that have dominated the UKs weather for the last week will give way to milder air from the west as a slow-moving low pressure system and associated weather fronts sweep in. After temperatures dropped to -C in the north on Sunday night, Monday will remain chilly across the country, with morning mist and fog patches in the Midlands and the south of England. Some roads in Scotland and northern England could have ice patches.  Through the day, there will be scattered and occasionally heavy showers in eastern parts of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.At night, it will be frosty in places and patchy fog may make driving conditions dficult in some areas, the Met Office said. It will then change to wetter and windier weather across the UK from Tuesday, although temperatures will be mild. Storm Diana, named by Portugals national weather service, is expected to slam into the Azores on Tuesday as it moves north towards the UK.  The Met Office has warned of gales and spells of heavy rain for much of the country as Diana merges with another low-pressure system. The latest projection shows Diana and its outer bands moving across parts the island of Ireland before hitting Wales and England. Forecasters are predicting rain for every region in the UK. Deputy Chief Meteorologist Dan Harris said: “It now looks very likely that we will see a major change in the UK’s weather early in the week ahead. We expect spells of wet and windy weather to sweep across the UK from the south-west from Tuesday, although at the moment there is uncertainty around the timing and the focus for the heaviest rain and strong winds by Wednesday as Storm Diana approaches our shores. Meanwhile, forecasters believe the odds of a white Christmas in the UK are looking very good.

However, as a young princess she didnt have to guard her emotions so closely. As a teen she closely followed politics and the war effort during World War Two - with one particular event reducing the then -year-old to tears. On May , , Neville Chamberlain resigned as Prime Minister and advised Elizabeths father, King George VI to send for Winston Churchill as his replacement. Chamberlain resigned after losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons following the disastrous Norwegian campaign.  Earlier in , the Allies had approved a plan to seize the northern part of neutral Norway and possibly some iron mines in northern Sweden, where Germany obtained most of its ore.However, Germany had the same idea and on April  their troops occupied Denmark and began an invasion of Norway. The Allies sent troops to Norway but had little success as Germanys soldiers had overrun the country. On April  the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal, prompting a challenge against Chamberlain. He subsequently lost a confidence vote which resulted in Churchill becoming Prime Minister for the rest of the war. In his resignation speech broadcast that evening, Chamberlain told the nation: For the hour has now come when we are to be put to the test, as the innocent people of Holland, Belgium, and France are being tested already.  And you and I must rally behind our new leader, and with our united strength, and with unshakable courage fight, and work until this wild beast, which has sprung out of his lair upon us, has been finally disarmed and overthrown. Princess Elizabeth told her mother that it had moved her to tears, as noted in Andrew Roberts Churchill biography Walking With Destiny.The war continued for another five years with the Princess even joining the war effort.When Elizabeth was , she was allowed to join the Womens Auxiliary Territorial Service, becoming the only female member of the royal family to join the armed forces.  She was known Second Subaltern Elizabeth Windsor and trained as a mechanic and military truck driver. Churchill would go on to be an important figure in Elizabeths le as he was her first Prime Minister when she became Queen in .He remained Prime Minister until  and was instrumental in a number of issues in the royal family - such as the Queen and her children keeping the name Windsor following her marriage to Prince Phillip."},{"url":null,"title":"what palace insiders really think","story":"NewsWhat palace insiders REALLY think about Meghan Markle - and HarryMeghan Markle seems to be taking to the public side of her role well, but a palace insider says shes \"taking time\" with other aspectsShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  NOV NewsTheyre moving away from Kensington Palace next year \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBeing part of the Royal Family is an incredible privilege, but there are some clear ways in which its a double-edged sword. Meghan Markle has shown her passion for the humanitarian work that comes with being a royal, as well as her aptitude for speaking at public engagements. Although being a royal involves travelling the world to meet all kinds of people, there are all kinds of rules and protocol that must be adhered to - which is a far cry from Meghans former Hollywood lestyle. A royal insider has revealed what they really think of the way Meghan has taken to royal le - and apparently the change has taken time for her to accustom to.  Speaking to the Daily Mail, the source said: Shes a woman who has lived le into her s in her way... She is very self-sufficient. Understanding the Palace way, the deference, the politics and the fact that theres a pecking order, is taking a while for Meghan to get her head around. The insider added that she is very opinionated and Harry has become dictatorial of late, which has contributed to tensions. Hollywood living is undeniably starkly dferent to the royal lestyle, which comes with certain rules and constraints. Kensington Palace must feel like a dramatic change of pace to Meghans former lestyle as an actress in Toronto and Calornia - where there would have been signicantly less public scrutiny and restrictions over her activities. Meghan and Harry are moving away from the Palace to Frogmore Cottage on Windsor Estate next year, around the time they are expecting their first child. Speculation has been re about why Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are moving away.Sources have claimed its to do with tensions between Meghan and Kate, while others say its because Harry wants to raise his family further from the public eye and prying papparazzi.

Devastating footage shows some of the whales lying motionless and half-buried in the sand on the countrys Stewart Island. The creatures were discovered by a hiker camping in the area, who notied the Department of Conservationon Saturday night. The DOC said two pods of pilot whales were found stranded on the island, around  miles south of New Zealands South Island. Tragically, half of them were already dead. A decision was then made to put the rest of the whales down due to their poor condition and the remote location, DOC Rakiura Operations Manager Ren Leppens said.  Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully refloat the remaining whales was extremely low, said Mr Leppens, who described it as the most humane thing to do. However, its always a heart-breaking decision to make. The whales are thought to have been on the beach for perhaps a day before being found in two pods, just over a mile apart. Stewart Island, also know as Rakiura, is home to around  people. New Zealand has one of the worlds highest rates of whale strandings, although the precise cause for it is not known. The DOC said it responds to an average of  incidents a year, mostly for single animals.  Many factors could contribute to such whale and dolphin strandings, including sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather, according to the department. Ten pygmy killer whales were also stranded on Sunday at  Mile Beach on the western coast of the North Island. Two have since died and attempts were being made to refloat the rest. The DOC said the two events were unlikely to be related. About  whales died on a beach at the northwest tip of South Island last year in one of New Zealands largest recorded mass whale strandings.

The presidents forces attacked the vessels and blocked the strait - a major escalation that threatened to start a new war - after claiming the Ukrainian ships had entered Russias territorial waters.  Several Ukrainian sailors were wounded as Russia opened fire and captured two gunboats and a tug boat. Russian forces had placed a tanker under a bridge, which links the peninsula to southern Russia. This was to block vessels from accessing the Sea of Azov, which is shared by the two countries.  Ukrainian MPs are due to vote today on declaring martial law in response.

Ky Furneaux, a former Hollywood stuntwoman, appeared on the Discovery Channels TV show Naked and Afraid in a -hour episode, which ran in conjunction with the show Shark Week. Along with four other naked survivalists, Ms Furneaux and the team were taken to a barren island in the Bahamas without resources for their survival. And for food, the group ad to spear fish in one of the most shark-infested waters on earth. Even though there has been a recent spate of shark attacks in Australia and concern over the safety of the ocean Ms Furneaux thinks that sharks are misunderstood. The -year-old added that sharks show warning signs when they are likely to be a threat.  She told Daily Mail Australia: I think theyreamazing, I think theyre hugely misunderstood and I have been working to get more comfortable around them myself. Theyre like any animal, they have certain body language that you watch out for. The survivalist compared sharks to dogs and that it is easy to spot when the animal gets riled up. She said that like dogs, sharks could appear calm but when they feel a threat they show physical signs such as stfness and snarling. Ms Furneaux said: Sharks are very similar. When you see them in the ocean they move quite smoothly when they are not in predator mode. You see them cruising along... and theyre not threatening but then you can see when they start to go into hunt mode.  They do sort of puff up a little bit in their movements and become sharper and more erratic. You can tell that theyre getting excited by something. Ms Furneaux added that while filming Naked and Afraid she would know to be alert when more than three sharks would swim together as this demonstrated pack behaviour. So when trying to catch food for their survival the group had a few close calls with the sharks while fishing underwater. The group carried sticks while hunting and would use them to deter sharks from approaching - by tapping them on their sensitive snout.  She said: The only way we could eat was to spearfish. So obviously youve got a struggling fish in the water and that is one of the things that turns the sharks into predator mode.  Ms Furneaux was invited to appear in the all star shark episode of Naked and Afraid after bracing alligators and venomous snakes in a previous episode. She is excited for the show to air in Australia so viewers can have a greater education about sharks.

Ness Bank and Cavell Gardens ndash on the opposite side of the river ndash is also included in the proposed mph zone.The zone includes a road near the park where motorist John Macdonald knocked down a four-year-old boy and drove off leaving the youngster seriously injured in July last year. Macdonald was later jailed for four months, banned from driving for a year and fined pound.Statistics show several other accidents took place between January  and July  in the planned mph zone.Regional MSP and long-time road safety campaigner David Stewart said winning public support is vital for the project.ldquoWith such issues, I am always of the mind that key stakeholders and those directly affected should always be fully consulted on such matters and consideration given to any concerns raised before a final plan is put forward for approval, he said.ldquoI have in the past been an advocate for wider footpaths to better accommodate cyclists and pedestrians and I have also suggested that the surfaces be painted a set colour to inform those utilising them of their primary use.He added: ldquoWith regards to the mph speed restriction proposed for the Bught Park area, this makes total sense to me since this area is well utilised for sporting and recreational purposes by many people and will make the surrounding roads safer for all.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118523.jpg","title":"Victorian Market to get new look entrance","story":"A NEW-look entrance to the Victorian Market ndash costing pound, ndash has been approved by Highland Council planning officials.The local authorityrsquos plans for the change in Academy Street involve bringing the glazed screen closer to the street in order to improve visibility into the market.The planning application decision, taken under delegated powers, will see work starting in January at the market which dates back to .With Inverness Common Good Fund money, new external lighting will be fitted to highlight the architecture of the building that includes carvings of a sheep and a bull, and signage will be removed to ldquo historic integrity to the Academy Street faccedilade.The project marks the first stage of an action plan by the council and Inverness Common Good Fund to remodel the market hall.A pound, budget has been agreed for the new entrance, and an application for a grant of pound, has been submitted to the Inverness Townscape Heritage project towards the new entrance.The heritage project has plans to improve the appearance of that part of Academy Street, including Station Square, to make it more attractive.A business case for remodelling the Market Hall and entrance was approved by councillors in May and there is no timescale for the work.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118446.jpg","title":"Vital housing service is under review","story":"SCORES of vulnerable people in the Inverness area are set to lose a leline service.The housing support service provides practical help to people at risk of becoming homeless or struggling to manage their everyday affairs.But almost  long-term clients have received letters from Highland Council saying they will no longer receive it as it is only short-term.The move has alarmed charities such as New Start Highland and Gateway ndash previously the Highland Homeless Trust ndash which are contracted by the council to support clients with tasks such as managing money and helping to keep them safe.Following urgent representations, the council has agreed to review cases where there would be signicant hardship but concerns still remain that more people could become homeless or fall into debt.Frank Reid , of Dalneigh, suffers short-term memory loss and has relied on support from Gateway to maintain the tenancy of a bungalow since losing his we four years ago.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two.

But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed.

The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"bustling prestwick town praised national","story":"NewsBustling Prestwick town praised on national stageThe town landed second place in Scotland at the Great British High Street Awards last week.ShareByPippa Smith:,  NOV NewsSuccess Prestwick is boom town \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBustling business in Prestwick has been praised on the national stage.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

Grew up in Sarajevo and lives in GlasgowIrsquove been in Scotland six years and I was in London for  years. I came to work on the Commonwealth Games. The plan was to stay for a couple of years and then move on. But the people were nice and open and I thought that there was no way Irsquom going back to London.It was the people that did it. Does Glasgow feel like home  To be honest I never thought, as a displaced person, that I would find that kind of calm, warm feeling. But as much as I can have it, I have it here.Glasgow is much calmer than London. It is also the right size of city. We have a saying that Sarajevo is made for a measure of a man. Itrsquos the right size to exist in, and I think Glasgow is the same.During my first month here I couldnrsquot understand anybody. My first night I was in the local shop and this woman started talking to me and I thought what is going on here  Then I realised, lsquoYoursquore the idiot, not the person talking to you. Yoursquore the one thatrsquos been completely desensitised by being in London so long.rsquo And I just thought this is lovely.Francois Owiafe, former teacher from Ghana. Self-employed and living in EdinburghThe job that I did in Ghana was examination administrator, a senior job, based in Accra, the capital of Ghana. I came to Scotland because my we had come here to study and had benefited from a scheme which allowed her to stay. It wasnrsquot easy to find work. I could have got work as a teacher in England but that wasnrsquot possible here.People ask questions like, lsquoHow did you come here  Did you come by aeroplane or by boat rsquo Even though we have British nationality, it seems sometimes that people think we are coming in to drain the welfare system. But the job I had in Accra was a very good one.Irsquom a practising Christian and I do volunteer work with the street pastors. I have experienced racism. I had a particularly bad situation where myself and my children were racially abused on the bus. It went to the courts and the guy was found guilty. In spite of all these things itrsquos still better here. For instance, in Africa our healthcare is poor. Also roads are bad. Ghana has one of the highest rates of death by accident in the world. We have people who have come here and made Scotland their home then gone back to visit their family, and never come back because they boarded a car and had an accident and died.Ruzita Millington, grew up in Singapore. Raising her family in EdinburghWhen I was in Singapore, Irsquod never heard of Edinburgh. But, oh my God, Irsquove ended up in a lovely gem of a city. I met my husband in Singapore. He was working there, and he had to come back here with his work. He brought me here on holiday during the festival time. It was love at first sight.The first thing that got me was the culture shock. It was just not what I had imagined. I come from a culture that is quite conservative. I have three children. They know they are Muslims, but they go to Catholic school. They participate in all the Christian events. I think thatrsquos your opportunity to meet other cultures.What I miss most is the food. Recently I made a curry for a girl who had moved from Singapore to study here because I know how it feels to have come here. I cooked her chicken curry for her birthday the way that they have it back home.Lourdes Gala Santos, from Tenere. Lives in Glasgow and works in wind turbine engineeringI moved to Scotland in  because I got a PhD position at the University of Strathclyde. I remember getting on a flight into Prestwick and taking a train into Glasgow and being very excited about my new le. On the train the ticket master was saying, lsquoTickets, tickets.rsquo And he asked, lsquoItrsquos your first time in Scotland rsquo I said, lsquoYeah, Irsquom just moving here. Irsquom so happy to be moving to the north of England.rsquoThe face of this man! He said, lsquoThis is Scotland. Scotland is a country.rsquo So within half an hour of landing I was educated into Scotland being a country. I said I was really sorry. I was so glad that he did not throw me off the train.The following day I kept seeing the St Andrews flag and I phoned my mum and I was saying, they must love Tenere here because our flag is absolutely everywhere. Then I realised that the Scotland flag is exactly the same as the Tenere flag. We share the same flag. It makes me feel at home.My PhD was in aerodynamics and control for wind turbines. So I started a career working in the renewables industry. For wind and tidal and marine renewables, therersquos not a better place to be than Scotland.One of the things that surprised me about people in Scotland is the amount of alcohol people drink with the intent of getting drunk. In Spain and Italy we also drink but not so much to get hammered.Scotland has the most amazing outdoors that Irsquove ever seen. I have travelled quite a bit and when you go to the Highlands or the coast itrsquos incredible. No picture can convey how overwhelming it is up there. I discovered cycling here in Glasgow to my surprise. I had rarely touched a bicycle before that..Praveen Kumar, grew up in India, worked in some of the worldrsquos best hotels and runs Tabla restaurant in PerthBefore I came to Scotland I was working for Sandals hotels in Jamaica and met a couple in the Caribbean. I had been going to go to work in the United States but it was them that enlightened me about Scotlandrsquos quality of le. I found a job at the Turnberry. I came in February  and it was a sunny day, but freezing, and I arrived in shorts and a T-shirt from Jamaica. That two minutes walking from my flight to the terminal was my first experience of actually being in the cold.Later, I got headhunted by Gleneagles. Not long after that my parents found a girl for me, in India, and in March  we got married. In  we opened our restaurant, Tabla, in Perth. Somebody recently asked me, lsquoWhy Perth  Yoursquove got so much talent and knowledge. Why not London rsquo The answer was itrsquos not money that motivates me, itrsquos quality of le. My we and I have built a community around us. The restaurant is embedded in the society in which we live.The most important thing Irsquove found here is the people and their friendliness. Theyrsquore approachable. You can approach anyone in Scotland. If you ask me Irsquom Scottish. Itrsquos been  years so I think I can call myself Scottish.I miss the buzz you get in India. Thatrsquos one thing thatrsquos missing here. In Indiayou want to do something, you can do it straight away. If I want to go and see my friends, I just go. I donrsquot need an appointment. I donrsquot need permission. I just go. And, of course, I miss the food, the street food. Thatrsquos what Irsquom building a business around bringing the rustic street food to all over the UK in a chain of restaurants.Tatsuya Minagawa, , from Yamagata, Japan. Owns renowned whisky venue The Highlander Inn in Craigellachie.I was working in a whisky bar in Japan and I thought Irsquod see more of the whisky environment, this is why I came to Scotland. It was meant to be just for one year. Itrsquos been more than  years now. Probably my biggest surprise was how friendly people were. It was strange for a big city like Edinburgh. Itrsquos not the same as in London or Tokyo. Then I moved to Speyside and was a bit worried because it was so remote...but it turned out to be really good.I was let down by the work attitude at first. It was so much dferent than in Japan. The efficiency of the staff, the attention to detailhellip I still think, to be honest, that itrsquos like that. Back home I had to ask only once for something to be done, but here sometimes you have to ask two or three times. But itrsquos a small issue and I love Scotland. I enjoy living here ndash this country welcomed me very well.Working in the whisky industry, I saw that the drinking culture is very dferent. Here, bars close very early, and people rush to get the last drinks, whereas in Japan they are open for longer hours, which means that people take more time to indulge. We do get drunk, too, donrsquot get me wrong, but in a much dferent way.I find that Scottish and Japanese, we are very dferent but also very similar: we donrsquot have big conversations when we meet the first time: it takes a long time to build a relationship, but when it happens, it lasts longer for forever.Vangelis Stamoulis, , came from Athens, Greece, in  to do postgraduate studies at University of Aberdeen. Sales manager in the oil and gas industry.I found the Scottish culture to be very similar to the Greek one: people are very open, sociable and direct and hospitality is great ndash I felt at home almost immediately. One of the surprises was how the weather was, particularly in Aberdeen, being so far in the north. It doesnrsquot change much ndash itrsquos either cold or very cold, you never actually get a summer.What I really like is that you can get in the car and in less than half an hour you are in the middle of an amazing countryside, andyou like hiking, photography, visiting castles or whisky distilleries thatrsquos perfect.I guess that was the most enjoyable aspect: although I live in a city it felt like living in a village. However, Aberdeen is an international city because of the oil and gas industry, you get to meet people from all over the world, and Scottish people are very tolerant with dferent cultures.I think that Brexit is going to affect all of us, both European and British citizens, and will do so in a very bad way. For me, it has been a beautul home. Irsquove built my professional career here, itrsquos a beautul and safe country, and I hope that I can continue leading my le here.Bola Ugoji, grew up in Nigeria. Runs MaDebrsquos African food shop in EdinburghIn  I came from Nigeria to join my husband who was working in Edinburgh. Irsquod never travelled to the UK before. My -year-old daughter and I came through Heathrow, met my husband and he brought us to Edinburgh. I remember when I walked around then, there were few blacks. But that has changed. Now we have a lot of black people around. Still, even then it was okay because a lot of the white people would come to you and ask you questions, smile at you.After I had my second daughter I felt it would be best for me to set up my own business. I saw a shop space on Great Junction Street and took over that place, selling African food. I was there for nearly five years. Sometimes when I walked down the road, everyone would be waving, lsquoMaDeb! MaDeb!rsquo A year ago I moved the shop to this site on Leith Walk.Here, when your mum is old, she has to go to a home. Where I come from, we donrsquot do that. If my mum is old, I, or my young ones, look after her. I found it shocking when I came here. There was an old lady neighbour living by herself. Sometimes I would go in to say hello, just to chat with her. She was happy seeing us. It was shocking to me that she was alone."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-red-gown-worn-by-st-andrews-university-students-mired-in-legal-wrangle","story":"While the use of gowns at other universities has been relegated to graduation day, undergraduates at St Andrews still cloak themselves in scarlet for chapel services, formal dinners, meetings of the union debating society and the traditional pier walk each Sunday.:Scarlet gowns of St Andrews University worn \"to discourage student vice\"Now the traditional red gown is at the centre of a legal wrangle after lawyers for St Andrews raised an action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh against a private company which is supplying similar garments at around two thirds of the price of the official version.Purchasing a gown from the university shop will set students back pound, but Churchill Gowns, founded in Australia in , is offering red \"St Andrews\" gowns on its website at pound.Churchill also sold gowns in the Fe town during Freshers Week in September, partnering with a local business. The move angered the students association because it holds a sale of second hand gowns to help fund student support services.:University principals urged to take tougher political line on BrexitLegal representatives of St Andrews are alleging Churchill Gowns advertised their products in such a way that suggested \"a  endorsement by or association with the university\" and thus was \"likely to deceive the public into a mistaken belief\" that the goods being sold were official university products.The Churchill website currently states: \"The red undergraduate gown is an icon of the University of St Andrews, and part of a tradition much loved by its students.\"Made from a fleece blend fabric with a velveteen collar, the scarlet gown also undoubtedly serves to keep students cosy and warm, even on the Scottish coast.\"At Churchill Gowns you can order your red St Andrews undergraduate gown brand new. Our St Andrews undergraduate gowns are made to university specications.\"Churchill Gowns have been asked not to sell any university gowns or goods with the trade marks \"University of St Andrews\" or \"St Andrews\" and not to pass themselves off as being associated with, endorsed by, or connected with \"the university or its business\".However, Churchill Gowns defended its methods and said it would continue to advertise and sell its red gowns to students from St Andrews.The company said its online sales page had a clear disclaimer stating: ldquoChurchill Gowns is not affiliated with and does not represent this institution in any way.Oliver Adkins, the UKs managing director of Churchill Gowns, said the business was founded to offer students a more affordable and sustainable alternative to traditional academic dress suppliers.He said: \"We believe participation in these ancient traditions should not be reserved for those who can afford to pay a premium, and instead should be open to all.\"Itrsquos a shame that the University of St Andrews are seeking to deny students this choice and have gone to such extreme s to protect the profits they make.\"Churchill Gowns has never sought to prevent students from buying a university endorsed gown. However, we will strongly defend our right to compete in the marketplace and offer a more affordable option to students for whom a pound price tag is out of reach.\"A spokesman for St Andrews said: \"We believe in responsible enterprise, and that students should expect the purchase of a red gown to be a decision based on clear and consistent information.\"The purpose of the cease and desist letter is to make clear the concerns of the university and its students. In our view it is not sufficient that a company states it is not affiliated with the university, while it also claims gowns are made to university specications.: Parents warned of unprecedented school cuts and redundancies\"This is a  endorsement, which we believe constitutes mis-selling of gowns to students who believe they will be of equivalent quality to the official university gown.\"We know student representatives are understandably concerned that students are being led unwittingly to purchase gowns that are dferent from official gowns, which do not support the Student Association or teaching and research within the university as official gowns do, and that a unique student tradition is being diminished by this confusion. Association staff take seriously their duty to protect student interests, and we expect them to do so robustly and fairly.\"Earlier this year, an independent adviser to the Scottish Government on widening access argued the wearing of the red gown at St Andrews was elitist.Professor Peter Scott said at the time: \"A university such as St Andrews, that prides itself on its traditions, needs to take into account the fact that that might act as a bit of a put-off for certain applicants.\"Students there parade around in red gowns. That is probably not an image some people want to be associated with. Such universities need to work a bit harder to provide to those people that they would fit in and would be welcome there.\""},{"url":null,"title":"patrick-harvie-calls-for-indyref2-date-very-soon","story":"Patrick Harvie, co-convener of the Scottish Greens, said people in the Yes movement were ldquoimpatient and the SNP government should set out its position ldquovery soon.Unionist campaigners claimed the Yes movement was starting to ldquosplinter at the top.The First Minister promised last year that she would set out a ldquoprecise timescale on a new vote this autumn, once the terms of Brexit became clear.But she admitted last week that she may not be able to overcome the UKrsquos government rigid refusal to grant Holyrood the power needed for a second referendum.She saidthat happened, she would make it an issue at the  Holyrood election and seek a fresh mandate, rather than attempt to hold a wildcat Catalan-style referendum.Her comments dismayed many in the Yes movement who want a referendum sooner.Polls suggest Unionist parties are on track to have a majority at Holyrood after , scuppering any chance of a referendum.At last monthrsquos SNP conference, MP Angus MacNeil said his party mustnrsquot ldquodither like the Jacobites and turn back on the road to victory, as ldquothe opportunity is here and now.Speaking to the Herald to mark  years as the Greensrsquo leader at Holyrood, Mr Harvie said he wanted action in the current parliament.He said: ldquoI donrsquot knowit will happen within this term.

If Britain accepts the common rules or ldquolevel playing field on trade and services, it has also to accept ldquothe integrity of the Unionrsquos legal order... including the role of the Court of Justice of the European Unionin the interpretation of Union law.This has been compared to the kind of control the old Soviet Union exercised over nominally autonomous republics like the Ukraine. Thats unfair: the EU is not a communist dictatorship. But it does look very like the current EU arrangement with Turkey, which is in the Customs Union for goods but not in the EU. This is because of Britains commitment to the Northern Irish backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which accompanies the Political Declaration.The backstop began le as an attempt to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but has ended up placing the UK in an intolerable position for a sovereign nation: having to accept laws over which it has no control.

Worse still, Britain can only leave the backstop by mutual agreement with the EU, which gives Brussels an effective veto on Britainrsquos departure from it.

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

The survey also found that one in four people wrongly believed that credit unions make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign – ‘People, Not Profit’ – aims to highlight that credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, providing loans and savings, and that most people living in Scotland would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live. Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has said Albert Street and Bridge Street, in Kirkwall, will be closed to traffic at times in the week ahead while repair work takes place.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Monday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The daughter of a self-made man, Coates gained a first in econometrics and went on to build her business up from scratch as a result of an instinct for the future and sheer hard graft. As that business grew, she based it in Stoke – bringing good jobs to a languishing post-industrial city – and set up a foundation which has donated £m to charities like Oxfam and CAFOD. On top of throwing energy into growing her company, she has five children, four of whom are adopted from the same family.There is a lot to commend there in , her entrepreneurship was recognised when she was awarded a CBE for her services to the community and business and the following year she was named one of the UK’s most powerful women by BBC Radio ’s Woman’s Hour.And yet for all Coates’ undoubted attributes, there is no getting away from the central fact: her online betting company, Bet, which last year had an operating profit of £m, has flourished on the back of the UK’s two million problem gamblers and the obscene salary she pays herself – which is , times the national average – is money that would have been better staying in the pockets of those iniduals who can ill afford to lose on the horses .Much attention has been paid to the evils of Fixed Odds Betting Terminalswhich have been spreading like smallpox in the UK’s most deprived areas where people stake what little money they haveon the vain hope of beating the system.FOBTs – described as the “crack cocaine of gambling” – are so pernicious because bets of up to £ can be placed every  seconds often the terminals are juxtaposed with pawnshops encouraging those who have already lost too much to trade their possessions for one more go.After a succession of suicides were linked to FOBTs, the government promised to reduce the maximum stake to £. Of course, reducing the maximum stake reduces profits, which in turn reduces income to the Treasury. It took the resignation of sports minister Tracey Crouch to force the government to back down on plans to delay the move until October . Thanks to Crouch, it will now take place in April as originally promised.This is a step forward but the understandable focus on FOBTs means the burgeoning issue of online gambling has been less publicised. Which brings us back to Coates. Coates is no stranger to high stakes. She began her career in her family’s bookmakers business. In , she realised the future of gambling was online and borrowed £m from RBS with the family firm as collateral. Her risk paid off as Bet has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, taking £.bn in wagers last year alone.But there are many things about Betthat don’t sit easy. There’s its name for a start. Bet is encouraging consistent, daily betting – not the odd flutter on the World Cup or the Grand National.Then there’s the whole tax avoidance thing. Like most online gambling companies Bet moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its more “favourable regulations” .But mostly, the unease with Coates’ success comes from knowing it is built onan upsurge in online gambling amongst smart phone-using millennials who can place a bet at the tap of a screen. Unlike casinos and indeed FOBTs, online gambling sites can be accessed day or night, sober or drunk, and using a credit card. The service Coates’ company offers is not merely  days a year, but also  .A recent report from the Gambling Commission showed  to -year-olds are the group most likely to have more than five online gaming accounts and to have gambled in the past four months.Online, stakes on casino games like blackjack and roulette have been known to be as high as £,. In sports, there is now a panoply of hypotheticals you can take a punt on. Where once the options were fairly limited – the final result, the highest goal scorer – there is much more focus on in-play betting: the first penalty, the first red card or even, in one famous case, whether or not a particular player will eat a pie on camera. Sure, some of this is harmless – a way of adding a bit of extra excitement to the event but it’s not the harmless gambling that brings the likes of Bet the millions it’s the problem gambling. Coates’ financial success also underlines the way in which gambling and football have become totally enmeshed. North and south of the border, betting companies such as William Hill and Ladbrokes sponsor leagues and cups and strips, largely replacing tobacco and alcohol brands.In Coates’ case, the connection is even closer Bet has . per cent of the shares in Stoke City FC Coates’ father Peter is the chairman and her husband Robert is a director.Online gambling is widespread among players who tend to have a lot of down time sitting around hotel rooms with nothing to do but play on their phones there is peer pressure too. It gives the players something to bond over, the irony being, of course, thatthey are caught gambling on football matches they face a fine or suspension.I suppose you could argue that making money out of gambling is no worse than making it out of smoking or drinking all three involve fostering potential addictions. But in Coates’ case, it’s the sheer scale of the inidual profiteering that shocks. The £m she is pocketing this year alone is more than double the total wage bill for Stoke City.That sum would be offensive enough in any sphere butshe were making her money from manufacturing a product or providing a service or creating something of social value, then at least there would be a quid pro quo.As it is, it is dirty, predatory money, and she’s made no attempt to cleanse it the addiction charity Addaction claims the sum she paid herself is over  times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment, and her foundation has made no contribution to that cause.To say Coates has worked hard for what she has earned is not enough to say she is not breaching any laws is a cop-out.The growth of Bet depends on persuading more and more people to squander money they cannot afford on a game that, in the long-run, they will always lose. And – successful woman in a man’s world though she is – that’s not something to celebrate.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835020.1543237517!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour says jeremy corbyn would relish tv debate on brexit deal","story":"Jeremy Corbyn would #relish# a debate on television with Theresa May over the terms of the Prime Minister#s Brexit deal, a spokesman has revealed.

It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail.”Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson branded the Prime Minister’s deal a “disaster” and a “humiliation” for the UK.In his regular Dailycolumn, he said: “The other EU countries have signed the deal immediately, because they know that they have us exactly where they want us.“We are a satellite state - a memento mori fixed on the walls of Brussels as a ghastly gaping warning to all who try to escape.”More than  Tories have rejected the deal, with opposition parties - and Mrs May’s allies in the DUP - also set to oppose it.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834948.1543230848!/image/image.jpg","title":"michael russell scotland sold out and sidelined by brexit deal","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scotland has been sidelined by the deal agreed between the UK and the EU, according to Scotland#s Brexit Secretary Mike Russell.Mr Russell said the Withdrawal Agreement, signed off by EU leaders in Brussels on Sunday, would also sell out vital national industries.The Scottish Government said it will publish its analysis this week of the impact the deal could have on the Scottish economy and living standards.Mr Russell said: “Far from providing certainty, this is a blindfold Brexit which will lock in years of negotiations and uncertainty with no guarantee there will even be any sort of trade deal at the end of the process.: Britain ‘taught lesson’ over Gibraltar“The UK Government’s focus has been on Gibraltar and, rightly, Northern Ireland, but Scotland has been sidelined.“It is not just the fishing industry that is going to be sold out by the Tories, the whole economy will be damagedthe Tories succeed in dragging Scotland out of the Single Market, which is eight times the size of the UK alone.“This week we will publish evidence-based analysis of the damage this deal will do to jobs and living standards in Scotland and why we must instead stay in the EU or at least the Single Market and Customs Union.”: Reaction to EU Brexit dealEuropean Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned Britain cannot expect to get a better Brexit dealthe UK Parliament rejects the agreement.He told reporters in Brussels: “This is the deal.

Mossa-Rahmani said that its assets would be “better placed in the bosom” of DNO, which is Norway’s oldest independent oil and gas company.The offer comes on the back of weaker oil prices in recent weeks. The price of Brent crude has tumbled since hitting a four-year high in September, with a barrel trading at  on Monday morning.Analysts at BMO said the offer of p per share was below their valuation of p per share.“DNO’s bid looks opportunistic, coming on the back of recent weakness in commodity markets,” they said.“Faroe’s strong balance sheet and growth trajectory means it is relatively well insulated against short-term oil price moves.”This was echoed by Cantor Fitzgerald, who said: “While DNO’s signicant existing stake may make a takeover now appear ultimately inevitable, in our view investors would be ill-advised to accept what is clearly a “low-ball” offer.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4834895.1543221305!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch every scot should see film nae pasaran","story":"The story of the Scottish workers# solidarity against Chile#s General Pinochet is more relevant than ever, writes Lesley Riddoch.It’s , East Kilbride. Bob Fulton, a Rolls-Royce engine inspector, s to his section, upset and anxious. He’s just told colleagues that a Chilean Air Force jet engine has arrived in the factory for maintenance and he’s refusing to let it go through, in protest against the recent military coup of General Pinochet. He’s seen the images of people packed into football stadiums awaiting charge, torture and execution. He’s seen the Chilean Air Force jets bombing Santiago on TV News, and now one of the engines from those very planes is right there, waiting for inspection. He can see his supervisors approaching, he knows he’s about to be fired yet he feels a responsibility to people he will never meet, from another continent, hemisphere and culture.Why  WellBob was living in Chile, not Scotland, he would likely have been in those trucks, on those torture tables and maybe finally in those gutters.As a trade unionist, survivor of war, skilled craftsman and active citizen, the shape of Bob’s entire le produced the conviction that he could and should take a stand.So Bob and his colleagues refused to service the Rolls Royce engines and began the astonishing train of events that placed an almighty Lanarkshire spanner in Pinochet’s mighty killing machine, saving the lives of countless Chilean folk.This story of everyday heroism is being told for the first time – and just in time given the age of participants -- in a film called Nae Pasaran, showing in art-house venues around Scotland and the UK right now. It’s a moving, painstakingly researched, funny and beautully made film which demonstrates the power of solidarity and comradeship among men lucky enough to complete their working lives before our diminished and precarious world of de-unionised, casual employment, out-sourcing and zero hour contracts drew breath. It shows the dogged determination of one filmmaker to track down interviewees across generations and two hemispheres.And, as we stand on the brink of a shameless, corrupt and nakedly greedy milestone in British history – it shows with searing clarity how British society has changed.The relatively confident, moral and organised society of the s produced citizens able to make easy connections between workers across the world. That society has gone – though it’s not completely extinguished in Scotland.Over four intervening decades, Britain has become a byword for political hostility to immigrants and indference to Windrush citizens a country where scapegoating the EU for every British problem and accusing EU nationals of queue-jumping has poisoned the well of democracy so badly that no rational decision about Brexit can be taken for fear of further infuriating a ripped-off underclass of workers with no hope of change in their lives, except a downward spiral into the abject poverty described recently by an UN envoy whose report has been dismissed as impertinent by the UK government.Over the  years that Bob and his friends grew older, retired, watched families grow up and passed on their values to children and grand-children, Britain has morphed into an elitist, market-led society where citizens experience the state as atomised consumers and humiliated claimants – not primarily as well-resourced workers. The British economy depends on the privatisation of natural monopolies and the deregulation of almost everything . Our state acts without pity or mercy, lies as it breathes and uses a balance sheet for a moral compass.So it’s no surprise that Britain refuses to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite the international outcry over Jamal Khashoggi’s killing, the role our weapons continue to play in perpetuating war and famine and the principled stand by Germany, Finland and Denmark who’ve ended arms sales. What a contrast to the s Labour Government which led worldwide condemnation of the military coup in Chile and created an escape route for dissidents until Margaret Thatcher won power and helped prop up Pinochet and his murderous regime.A friend to dictators – that’s what Britain has become. And that’s why Scots desperately need an injection of the insight, determination, morality and clarity of Bob Fulton, John Keenan and Robert Sommerville right now, because we face some massive moral decisions – as voters, workers and citizens.Can every union and worker at Scots-based arms manufacturers just ignore the powerful parallels with  or will just one worker draw inspiration from the men of East Kilbride, and refuse to supply weapons to the Saudi regime Nae Pasaran’s Facebook page contains this powerful observation from a recent viewer: “Many of the folk making bombsights for despots will never work againthey down tools for political reasons. It’s going to take decades to reverse that situation...we ever do. But when I come to be judged, the crime that will send me to the underworld is that my generation allowed the present political class to take power uncontested.”Such abdication of responsibility is just not possible now. Scotland is set to be hauled out of the EU in coming months – out of an arena in which workers rights are taken seriously, trade unions are part of enduring social contracts and respect for human rights underpins international law.If that happens, the journey back to something resembling an equal, caring society will look so long and arduous that many Scots will simply give up. And we can’t. That’s why every Scot should see this filmthey possibly can. Nae Pasaran is testimony to how much Scotland has lost as a society but also how much is retained – above all the knowledge that we have a choice about serving the super-rich, facilitating their wars and creating tools of repression and a choice about remaining in a union that demands our compliance and ignores our political priorities. The old heroes of East Kilbride will stir something in every person lucky enough to see their story.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He

Highlands and Islands Enterprise who commissioned the report have described the findings as a starting point.But it appears that there would have to be very persuasive arguments to now veer from this set course.HIEs head of business development Susan Smith told the Strathy: \"This is the start of a long journey but at the centre of this needs to be the buy-in from stakeholders and the local community.\"Naturally an element of funding has to come from the public purse.\"There are large infrastructure funds for which this project may be eligible.\"Intriguingly she continued: \"Without setting hares racing it is prudent that we look at what alternative funding mechanisms might be available.\"I would put the option forward there may be a number of philanthropic investors out there who are passionate about Cairngorm who may with a sensible model and plan consider some form of philanthropic investment.\"Ms Smith would only add when pressed: \"We have a very loose expression of interest which suggest to us there may be the opportunity to do a bit more work to tease out whether this is an alternative strategy but there is absolutely no guarantee.\"On Coire na Ciste, she said the consultants found there was no business case to develop the area as campaigners and many ski visitors would like to see.The HIE boss said: \"They have come back quite unequivocally saying that it would not stack.\"They have looked at the two sites and said it is unsustainable as a second site until there is a capacity of  peopleor more using CairnGorm Mountain because facilities would have to be doubled up.\"This is the view of the experts and they have consulted widely and I have to take confidence in that... to deviate from these findings there would have to be a signicant rationale to do so.\"Ms Smith said the two new chairlts would replace some of the surface lts but was unable to say which ones.She said that their partners Highland Council, Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Enterprise Scotland were enthused and excited by the vision.She said: \"They believe that for the first time in many years this is a sensible approach for the way forward.\"She also said HIE wants to be much more inclusive working with the right community representatives.Ms Smith explained: \"It can not be a free for all.

not the pound.m which Councillor Bruce has claimed.\"HIE also acquired pound.m in preference shares.\"However, due in large part to delay, obfuscation and obstruction by the previous administration of Highland Council, planning permissions were still not able to be delivered after  frustrating years of trying.\"As a result, and to the intense dismay and signicant financial cost of the three partners involved, the scheme, which would have created hundreds of much-needed jobs locally in an area of the country which desperately needed them, was forced into administration.\"This obviously meant the loss of pound.m of public money, which was utterly lamentable and deeply regrettable, as well as millions of pounds of losses to the three partners involved, but it also delayed huge investment in the local economy.\"It was only because Macdonald Hotels had a rock-solid commitment to regenerating the resort that we reached an agreement with the administrators in June  which prevented it from closing down completely for a second time.\"Ironically, it was only after the administration process that Highland Council granted the planning permission which had been applied for  years previously and which two previous owners had walked away from during that time.\"There was nothing controversial within that planning permission and itrsquos no more than the design of the resort as it is today.\"Since then we have invested pound.m in transforming the infrastructure at Aviemore and are now the largest private-sector employer in the area, with hundreds of full and part time staff employed there and an annual wage bill of pound.m.\"\"Indeed, we estimate that the resort will have hosted over , overnight stays, including several international conferences ndash some of them with up to  delegates - in the current year, many of which will provide vital additional income to local bars, restaurants, shops and attractions.\"Gordon Fraser, deputy chairman of Macdonald Hotels  Resorts, said: \"It is, of course, right and proper that local politicians get involved in such important issues, but for Councillor Bruce to insist that we should simply swallow the enormous increases in rates, salaries and energy costs at Aviemore without seeking a reasonable increase in the amount we receive for allowing Highland High Le members to use private leisure facilities, is blatant double-standards.\"Itrsquos a bit rich for the council to increase our annual rates bill by . per cent in the year to March  and yet when we seek a modest uplt in charges to help us cover a small element of those and many other cost increases, one of the councilrsquos own officials described our request as lsquounaffordablersquo.\"Like us, many local businesses might consider their large rates increases to be lsquounaffordablersquo but we have no choice other than to pay them.\"Councillor Bruce should remember that we entered into this agreement, and were happy to do so, on the basis that it saved Highland Council from having to spend many millions on building their own swimming pool and leisure facilities locally.\"And he should also bear in mind that the annual sums we are discussing are far, far lower than those which Highland Council would face each year for running their own facilities.\"Despite the ill-judged intervention of Councillor Bruce, we have been encouraged by the constructive and helpful approach of other politicians and hope to meet with senior council officials in the very near future to resolve what has been a damaging and unnecessary episode.\"The sooner we can welcome High Le members back into Aviemore, the better, but it has to be on a sustainable and viable commercial basis.\"Councillor Bruce was unavailable for comment.He had asked: \"Given that HIE awarded an pound. million funding package to Macdonald Hotels to develop the Avie-more Resort ndash including the construction of the leisure arena in the early s ndash should Macdonald Hotels not allow High Le card members to use the swimming-poolfacility in view of the public funds they enjoyed and has this point been raised in negotiations rsquoHighland Council has said it remains open to restarting negotiations.Aviemore Primary School pupils recently wrote to Mr Macdonald asking for the pool to reopen and the schools parent council led by Judith Thurlow has also been part of the campaign.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118344.jpg","title":"Its far from being the end of the line","story":"Tom Ramage\"IM nervous as heck!\" confessed Karen Blessington, as she prepared to launch her own railway line last Friday.\"I have never spoken in public in my whole le so please bear with me...\"The huge crowd certainly did that and they loved every minute of the occasion as the flag went up again at Grantown East exactly  years to the day it last went down.It had been quite a journey \"from sadness to joy\" as she put it, following those drastic Beeching cuts of the s.\"The Phoenix has risen from the ashes of a derelict brown site.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

Small steps towards big dreams!There will be  pieces on display at the exhibition and everyone is welcome to go along and show their support.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"alanah is a real inspiration","story":"ALANAH McGlinchey tells this reporter that it has been “such a boost” to have been the recipient of Inspirational Secondary School Teacher at the recent Andersonstown News Inspirational Youth of the West gala ceremony held in the Devenish Complex.The Religion teacher who has been a familiar face among the halls and corridors of St Louise’s Comprehensive College since  also teaches a Year Nine form class who are still bringing in congratulatory cards and presents for the popular teacher.A graduate of St Mary’s University College, Alanah told the Andersonstown News that she felt “really proud of myself, of St Louise’s and for the pupils when I heard about the Inspirational Youth nomination”.“When it actually happened, that my name was read out on the night, it was just so nice. I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family. There isn’t a day I don’t laugh in this school,” she said."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"football tops at coca cola plant causing division says local man","story":"A COCA-COLA worker has described working conditions at the multinational’s Lambeg plant as “intimidating and antagonising” for Catholic employees as breaches of the company’s policy on work clothing are on the rise.The man said that though the wearing of football tops is expressly banned, Rangers and Northern Ireland jerseys are routinely worn by members of staff with no action being taken. And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs. This is an intolerable situation for the NASUWT, we are committed to defending the rights of our members in this school and hope that a constructive engagement can begin soon with the employers to fully address the situation.”A spokesperson for the CCMS, which oversees St Patrick#s said: “CCMS fully appreciates the right of teachers to take industrial action. However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup claims there is a third way on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jon Tonge: Desire to retain the deal with Tories is still there Nigel Dodds: Brexit plan binds us into an EU straitjacket DUP to meet with business groups to discuss concerns \"There is a better way,\" Mr Dodds writes.\"Rather than waste any more time putting forward  choices, we need the Government to get on with securing a better deal.\"Our party wants a good deal for the United Kingdom, a deal which delivers upon the referendum result and a deal which ensures that Northern Ireland leaves with the rest of the UK.\"But it is not this deal. It is not a deal at any price.\"The DUPs Westminster leader said the UK has \"ended up with the worst possible outcome\".\"Leave voters are outraged at the betrayal of Brexit and Remain voters are asking what on Earth is the point of losing all our say, but still taking the EUs rules.\"The more people pore over the details, the more problematic the whole mish-mash becomes.\"The political declaration, despite previous promises, does not set out a clear future relationship and raises signicant issues in its own right.\"And the legally binding withdrawal agreement is fatally and fundamentally flawed.\"The DUP - on whose support the Prime Minister depends for her majority in Parliament - has vowed to oppose the draft withdrawal agreement with the EU over its concerns about the Irish backstop arrangement, which is designed to prevent the imposition of a hard border.The party says it cannot support any Brexit arrangements - such as the backstop - which treat Northern Ireland dferently from the rest of the UK.The North Belfast MPs call for a rethink comes a day after Mrs Mays planned withdrawal agreement was agreed by European Union leaders meeting in Brussels.But a raft of European leaders have insisted that there will be no more negotiations, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who insisted that the deal agreed by the EU  was final.Mrs Mays deal must now go to the House of Commons for approval - which is by no means certain.In addition to the  DUP MPs, more than  Conservative MPs have indicated their opposition to Mrs Mays deal, as have the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party.Speaking to the Andrew Marr TV show yesterday, DUP leader Arlene Foster called for a Brexit \"third way\", insisting the choice is not between the current draft agreement and no deal.As EU leaders endorsed the proposed legally-binding withdrawal agreement in Brussels, Mrs Foster made clear there were no circumstances under which her party would vote for it when it comes before the House of Commons.\"I believe we should use the time now to look for a third way, a dferent way, a better way,\" she said.She added: \"We shouldnt just accept an outcome for the sake of it - we should try to get a deal that is good for everybody.\"Were not advocating a no deal, were advocating a better deal. We want to see the Irish backstop gone. There is no need for the Irish backstop, so lets get rid of it.\"Askedshe would support the Prime Ministera parliamentary defeat triggered a confidence vote in the Government, Mrs Foster added: \"We will have to see what happens at that time.\"I think this last couple of weeks should tell all of us that you shouldnt jump ahead of ourselves.

The scandal is also making it dficult for patients who are desperate for treatment and are unable to wait for NHS care to see a neurology specialist.The earliest available appointment at two of the biggest private hospitals is in mid-February, while the waiting list at another clinic is six to eight months.It comes as neurologists who work at private clinics are devoting their spare time to running recall clinics and have scaled back on private work.With a shortage of neurologists, NHS neurology waiting lists had already been creeping upwards before the recall was announced.Health officials have insisted the recall process is not impacting upon the waiting times for first outpatient and review appointments.However, David Galloway, director of MS Society NI, said: \"Undoubtedly the recent patient recall has put additional strain on an already stretched service and increased the workload of the dedicated MS specialists who currently hold the service together. I am concerned the recall will impact further on these waiting times.\"The Department has made assurances that first time appointments will not be made worse. The same cannot be guaranteed for review appointments.\"Simply put, many of Dr Watts patients will ultimately need to be added to the caseload of another specialist consultant.\"Mr Galloway said the current crisis being faced by neurology is bringing into sharp focus the dficulty being faced by patients waiting for appointments.He continued: \"The Department of Health announced a review of neurology back in July. \"There is much work for that review to complete in order to tackle waiting times, provide patients with the standard of service they deserve and ensure sustainable, safe working conditions for medical professionals.\"The review needs to engage directly with patients and charities and bring tangible recommendations for improvement which the Department will need to deliver on.\"This review is an important part of restoring public confidence in neurology.\"Northern Ireland Director of Parkinsons UK Nicola Moore said: \"We are very aware of the issues people with Parkinsons are facing in regards to long waiting lists for neurology appointments and continue to highlight our concerns. \"The stress of waiting for an appointment can exacerbate Parkinsons symptoms and cause further deterioration of the health of someone living with the condition.\"Paula Bradshaw, Alliance Party health spokeswoman, said the waiting times are unacceptable.She said long-running promises made by the Department of Health to address problems in the service have not delivered for patients.\"One of my primary concerns is the emotional wellbeing of the patients on the waiting list,\" she said. \"This, in itself, is creating further pressures on the system as conditions worsen and mental wellbeing suffers.\"A spokesman from the Belfast Trust said it is working with the Health  Social Care Board to resolve the situation.He said: \"We appreciate waiting times are much longer than we would like.

Furthermore, few predicted that one of the biggest threats to the deal would eventually come from Brexiteer MPs when, in the early stages of the negotiations, Remain campaigners took the Government to the highest court in the land in order to secure a meaningful vote for MPs.

Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a “satellite state” of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal “does not deliver” on Brexit and “instead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state”.DUP oppositionLIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA - Party Leader’s Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast  https:w… https:t.co yhGYiTEN— DUPNovember , The Eurosceptics’ rejection of the plans stems in large part from the deal’s backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

“best deal” available to the UK and that one of the “big benefits” of the backstop is that it provides a single customs territory.The Taoiseach added thatthe UK Parliament vote against the deal, it will risk crashing out of the EU with no customs arrangements in place.“If they sign up to this deal, and evenwe can’t achieve a future relationship treaty, they have the assurance that they will continue to have access to EU markets no matter what and in the same deal we have the assurance that there will be no hard border.“I don’t want to speculate on a no-deal scenario but what I will say

take up their seats.He also said that Sinn Fein should take their seats ahead of the crucial Brexit vote despite its abstention policy.“Sinn Fein is an unusual party in that it isn’t taking up its seats in Westminster for one reason and not taking its seats in Stormont for another,” he added.“Generally, people who get involved in politics do so because they want to make a dference and they want to use the democratic process to get good outcomes for their citizens.“If they are not willing to take up their seats because they feel they can’t because they got elected on the basis of abstention,

But considering the makeup of Mitsubishi’s board, little opposition to his dismissal is expected.The board consists of Ghosn, Mr Masuko, two people from Nissan, two from the Mitsubishi group companies and two outsiders – a writer and an academic.Worries are growing about the future of the alliance between Renault and Nissan, while the future of the alliance with Mitsubishi, being more recent, could be even more precarious.Alliances often benefit carmakers because they share technology, parts, and supplier and sales networks, and sales volume tends to lower costs.Analysts say such sharing has been growing in importance as companies develop electric vehicles, net connectivity and articial intelligence for cars."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOFxcXC8xMVxcXC8yMzE3Mjc0NFxcXC9TY3JlZW4tU2hvdC0yMDE4LTEwLTEyLWF0LTE1LjQ2LjEyLTc1MHgzNTAucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvd3d3LmRlcnJ5bm93LmNvbVxcXC9hc3NldHNcXFwvaVxcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmc_dj0xXCJ9IiwiaGFzaCI6Ijk3MmMxMTk4ZmE5YWU1MzJmN2Q4ODNmMTdkODBlMzc4Mjg5MWY1NmIifQ==/screen-shot-2018-10-12-at-15-46-12-750x350.png","title":"irish filmmaker wants james bulger film screened derry reopen debate case","story":"The writer and director of an award-winning film about the murder of Liverpool toddler, James Bulger, screening in Derry this weekend, said he hopes the film will open up a new debate on what made two -year-old boys murder a child.Vincent Lambe’s film, ‘Detainment’, is based on the true story of James Bulger, abducted in Liverpool in  and found brutally murdered two days later. However, the most shocking aspect of the case was that the main suspects were just children themselves - two ten-year-old boys, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. Based on their interview transcripts, the film dramatizes the police interviews which took place at the time.Detainment stars Will O’Connell , David Ryan , Tara Breathnach , Morgan C. Jones , Brian Fortune , Kathy Monahan , and introduces two exceptional young actors, Ely Solan and Leon Hughes.Speaking to the Derry News, Vincent Lamb said that he hopes the film will challenge public perception of the boys who committed the murder and open a wider debate on the matter.When asked what drew him to the story, he replied: “I was asked that same question when I was over in London where I did an interview for Sky News the UK audience find it strange that an Irish filmmaker would be interested in something so deeply rooted in the British consciousness.“But it affected the people here in Ireland just as much as the people in the UK. I was  at the time it happened and I remember it very well.“I remember growing up hearing about it and heard it mentioned again as an adult and it was unexpected how I felt about it at the time.“I started reading everything I could find on it and then I got the transcripts [of the police interviews] and felt that I was seeing something not everyone  was seeing.”SensitiveVincent said that casting the child actors for the roles of Thompson and Venables was challenging but that the young actors, Ely Solanand Leon Hughes , who have been critically-acclaimed for their astonishing performances, were ‘phenomenal’.“I had a lot of apprehension about making a film on such a sensitive story,” he said.“The public outrage at the time was unprecedented and it hasn’t gone away, it’s still there. So many people just seen these boys as being evil and couldn’t cope with the fact that they were just two little boys. The only way they could make sense of it was to see them as evil.“Newspapers labelled them as ‘evil monsters’, the spawn of Satan’ and ‘freaks of nature. People hadn’t really looked at other points of view andyou did, you were criticised – people couldn’t see any other reason for it other than they were evil.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“When I was , I accepted that they must have been evil but as an adult when I researched it a bit more, my opinion altered and I hope that this film will help other people change their minds.“By looking into the boys’ family background, I got a better understanding of what could have led two -year-old boys to commit such a horrible crime.“This film is not sympathetic to the boys and is not trying to make an excuse for them in any way but it humanises them. People may be more comfortable thinking of them as evil monsters but, after reading the transcripts, it was a tragedy for three families and that’s not a popular opinion.“The film is entirely factual, there is no embellishment – it is almost entirely verbatim. When I was making the film, given my apprehensions, it was very important to me that everything was factual.”‘Prevent this happening again’Vincent said that he was especially nervous when he heard that journalist and expert of the James Bulger murder, David James Smith, was attending one a screening of the film at the Winchester Film Festival. Smith wrote a book on the matter, The Sleep of Reason: The James Bulger Case.“He turned up at the last screening in the UK and I was terried,” he said.“He’s such an expert on the case, I was dreading to hear what he thought but he said the film was ‘authentic’ and a ‘remarkable achievement’ which was an amazing endorsement.“He also wrote a lovely review saying thatthe audience were willing to find the truth out about those boys, they could not ignore their inescapable smallness.”“People don’t talk about this case enough, butyou have any other opinion other than the boys were monsters, it’s rejected and it stles debate on the issue. We want to prevent this happening again so we need to understand the case.“I remember the Judge’s comments about the boys and I thought it was a ludicrous decision to name them but the more I read, the more I understood his reasons – he wanted a discussion about it, to look into the background of the boys and see how something like could be prevented from ever happening again. I hope that people will debate the case again after watching the film.”Vincent finally had a word for the Bulger family: “I don’t want anyone to think that I don’t have sympathy for the Bulger family, I have enormous sympathy for little James, for what he went through and what his family have been through.”‘Detainment’ by award-winning director, writer and producer, Vincent Lambe and Irish producer, Darren Mahon, will screen at Foyle Film Festival in the Nerve Centre on Sunday, November , at pm.More information about the film and upcoming screenings can be found at: www.detainmentfilm"},{"url":null,"title":"new hotel set open derry march next year expand capacity additional","story":"A new hotel set to open in Derry next year is to expand its current capacity by  rooms, it has emerged.The new -bedroom Holiday Inn Express Hotel is currently under construction at the site of former Strand Bar and Flamin’ Jacks complex on the corner of Strand Road and Great James Street.It will create  new jobs once completed and boast a Marco Pierre New York Italian Restaurant, two meeting rooms and three retail units and will provide accommodation for up to , visitors a year.Speaking to the Derry News earlier this week, Brendan Duddy of the Duddy Group, the applicants behind the new development, said that it is hoped that the hotel will be operational by March .He added that the hotel would also be expanding its capacity to  bedrooms with the conversion of an existing floor at the top of the building.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshMr Duddy added that once opened, he hoped it would ‘transform’ the Strand Road area into a thriving hospitality hub.“We’re delighted to be extended the capacity, and we’ll be doing that through the conversion of what’s known as a ‘setback floor’, which will now be used for accommodation,” he said.“We’re currently looking at a March  opening date, and we’re excited about the impact this will have on the Strand Road area.“There’s been a lot of investment in that part of the town over the past years, there’s a great iety of places to eat and of course we’ve had Primrose really putting a lot of effort in.“Hopefully, we’ll also play our part in transforming the Strand Road and helping to increase footfall.”He added: “What you have to keep in mind is that every person who stays in Derry, spends in Derry, be that going out for a bite to eat, a drink, or taking a taxi somewhere, that is money which is pumped into the local economy and will not be lost to other areas.”"},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas lights","story":"Prize winners in the decorated lantern competitionreceive their prizes as Sue ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtHill presents Sophialtspan classtruncate-full-screengt Morgan with her first place award.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And the provisos we secured and she entered into then.... she is now casting aside.”The most generous comment about Mrs May from the  on Saturday came from Arlene Foster, who said: “I want to acknowledge the hard work and determined efforts of the prime minister to secure an agreement.“I believe she is genuine when she says she wants to see an outcome that does no harm to the Union and the internal market of the United Kingdom.”However, even that mild support was followed by sharp criticism, with Mrs Foster saying that the draft agreement “fails her own key commitments” and is “not in the national interest”.Mr Dodds also lashed Dublin for its handling of the situation.Although he did not name Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney, Mr Dodds delivered explicit criticism of them, accusing them of acting in a way which had made a no-deal Brexit more likely.He said: “There will be those who will continue to exploit Brexit, to try and weaken the Union and to further their own political agendas, but in doing so, they do irreparable damage to the public’s faith in politics and to relationships on these islands.“Be it those using the hard won peace in Northern Ireland as a political football to thwart or delay Brexit.Sam McBride: Arlene Foster is seeking to reinvent herself as a reformist Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Or those in other jurisdictions, trying to play up their republican credentials in advance of a forthcoming general election. By their actions they do more to advance the possibility of a so called no deal Brexit than anyone.”The DUP MEP Diane Dodds also denounced the prime minister.Mrs Dodds, the we of Nigel Dodds and a fervent Eurosceptic, will lose her job in March as a result of Brexit. She said that Theresa May was now prepared to sign off on a deal which she said no British prime minister could ever sign.She said that the backstop arrangement for Northern Ireland would mean “more influence for the Irish government than for a Stormont Executive” where ultimately businesses would have to lobby Dublin, not Belfast,they wanted to secure changes to EU regulations.try catch     .               ..

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story POLITICS DUP. Photo credit should read: Michael Cooper PA WireRather than the party being led on this issue by Mrs Foster, there is a sense that the party has led her.The issue was raised in robust terms at a recent meeting of the party executive and DUP councillors are concerned about it hanging over them as they campaign ahead of May’s council elections.Mrs Foster’s supporters point to her having at a very early stage – just a fortnight after BBC Spotlight in December  – made a speech to the Assembly in which she said that the absence of cost controls from the RHI scheme was “the deepest political regret of my time in the House”.However, that carefully calibrated phrase stopped short of an apology and was delivered in the strident tone which has marked most of Mrs Foster’s response to the scandal.While DUP critics will be sceptical about Saturday’s apology coming almost two years later, it is a shrewd move, pre-empting the inevitable criticism of Sir Patrick Coghlin’s report and allowing DUP councillors to point back to Saturday when voters confront them about RHI.The apology fitted into a broader and bolder argument from Mrs Foster who attempted to present herself as an agent of radical change who could fix the problems identied by the RHI Inquiry – even though she has been a senior figure in the Stormont Executive for every moment of the ten years of devolution.And it contained what may be a covert hint of her latest attempt to strike a deal with Sinn Féin to get Stormont back.With last February’s draft deal perishing on the refusal of the DUP to accept Mrs Foster’s willingness to agree to an Irish language act, the leader’s proposal on Saturday for “a new cultural deal for everyone in Northern Ireland that respects dference and fosters understanding” could be the latest incarnation of the proposed Irish legislation, alongside other issues such as Ulster Scots.Whether Mrs Foster’s attempt to reinvent herself as a reformist of the system in which she was a central figure for so long can work will first be determined by whether she can survive the outcome of the RHI Inquiry and then persuade both Sinn Féin and her own party to re-enter Stormont.DUP can’t support Theresa May deal which gives NI no say in EU laws, says Nigel DoddsMan in s tied up during aggravated burglary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A gt in your will can ensure that your most loved charities can continue to make a dference for many years to come.Will to Give member USPCA We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our valuesEimear McCooey, Will to Give Chair, agreed: ldquoWe plan for lersquos major milestones births, weddings, anniversaries but most of us shy away from talking about and planning for death - yet it is the one thing that is guaranteed to happen to us all!I strongly believe that talking openly about the future can help ensure we have a better experience when it eventually does happen, and one of the things we can plan for is the legacy we want to leave behind.Making a will is important because it gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your wishes will be respected and the ones you love are looked after, whether that be family, friends or even a well-loved charity.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
