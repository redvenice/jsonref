I remarked to Leanne that I hoped they stay on the path. Millie waved at the bus and ran off the path. It all happening in a split second.\u0027I braked straight away the minute she hit the bumper. I\u0027m completely sad and devastated at what happened. My thoughts are with Millie\u0027s family.\u0027  Bus driver Mr Walker said: \u0027I looked to the right, saw one car coming and halted and then saw the Mercedes coming from the left.\u0027I saw Millie and a friend stood on the path. I saw Millie look at me then she ran out. A girl on the bus shouted Millie and got off the bus and started CPR.\u0027              Millie (pictured left and right) had signed up as an organ donor just a few months before the crash and she subsequently saved the lives of three people by donating her liver and kidneysThe inquest heard there were no mechanical defects with the Mercedes that caused or contributed to the crash.Forensic collision investigator PC Michelle Ford said: \u0027I don\u0027t think Mr Turner would have been able to do anything to avoid that collision.\u0027Timothy Brennand, senior coroner for Lincolnshire, concluded that Millie died as a result of a road traffic collision and the cause of death was a head injury.He said Mr Turner was driving appropriately and lawfully, and said he had no opportunity to brake or avoid the impact.Mr Brennand added that Millie moved quickly off the pavement without looking, perhaps because of what she perceived to be a signal from the bus driver and a misapprehension that it was safe to cross.He said: \u0027The evidence is evenly balanced. The bus driver cannot recall a hand signal but he concedes that subconsciously he may have presented some sort of signal that he cannot remember.\u0027The witnesses recall a hand signal. Either way, the right thing for Millie to do would have been to look before she stepped out.\u0027 \u0027This is a tragic case for all concerned, from beginning to end.\u0027 Mr Brennand said: \u0027It seems to me that very often the generation that is to follow me are far more proactive, altruistic and far-sighted by making themselves familiar with giving these gifts of life.

We hope that he will reply within the timeframe.\u0027      But James Cleverly, the Tory Party chairman, said it was the job of Parliament to hold the Prime Minister to account, not the London Assembly and that the PM might refuse to appear at City Hall.The Sunday Times reported that Ms Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was treated to privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London.         Jennifer Arcuri and Boris Johnson (pictured in 2014). The Prime Minister signed off some £126,000 to the former model and businesswoman during his tenure as Mayor of London         Asked previously about the allegations, Mr Johnson (left) said \u0027everything was done with complete propriety\u0027 but declined to clarify the nature of his relationship with Ms Arcuri (right) Mr Cleverly, who previously served on the London Assembly, poured doubt on whether the PM would comply with the Assembly\u0027s demands for information.\u0027The London Assembly\u0027s job is to scrutinise the mayor of London, and in that capacity they need to focus on the failings and ineptitude of the current mayor,\u0027 he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.\u0027When I was on the London Assembly, it was quite common for Government ministers to refuse to appear.\u0027The body that exists to scrutinise ministers is the House of Commons, the body that exists to scrutinise the mayor of London is the London Assembly, and there is a clear ision and role there.\u0027When told the PM could be in breach of the law for failing to explain himself, Mr Cleverly replied: \u0027That\u0027s not my understanding.

I thought she should phone him to clear it up.\u0027He denies conspiracy to blackmail.His brother Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft relating to the footballer\u0027s Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.Prince Rowe denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.

Balpa also called a strike for this Friday, prompting BA to cancel all flights, before calling it off last week.Balpa said on Thursday it was “completely disingenuous” of the airline to blame pilots for its profit performance. The union said BA could have avoided the strikes, and their cost, for an outlay of just £5m in the pay negotiations. The airline, however, has claimed that the pilot demands would cost the airline an extra £50m.Brian Strutton, Balpa’s general secretary, said: “This is proof that BA’s intransigence towards its pilots is economic madness. Their total disengagement is evidence of a senior management team that has lost the plot and doesn’t know how to resolve their dispute with their pilots.”A total of 4,521 flights were cancelled over seven days to account for anticipated disruption on 9, 10 and 27 September, IAG said, although 2,196 flights were reinstated leaving 2,325 cancellations.BA also allowed passengers on other flights left unaffected by the industrial action to rebook or receive a refund. The financial impact of those pilot strikes was put at €137m. In addition, threatened strikes by ground staff at Heathrow airport cost IAG a further €33m.The company said it had also been hit by lower bookings at its low-cost carriers Vueling and Level, resulting in a further €45m hit. This means its 2019 operating profit, excluding one-off items, will be €215m lower than last year’s €3.48bn. IAG warned that further strike action would hit profits again.Willie Walsh, IAG’s chief executive, told analysts: “Clearly, BA bookings have been disrupted by the industrial action.”He said IAG would be looking at acquiring Thomas Cook’s slots at Gatwick airport following the travel company’s collapse, adding he was “pleased with the slots acquired from Monarch” when it went bust two years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1df2484da9667c097de17af1a51f89005e7b8496/0_143_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d33326514fdb463b37e9014ecaee87a0","title":"haunted lego fortnite blaster tipped top christmas toys hamleys","story":"Hamleys unveils 10 expected bestsellers amid efforts to mix physical play and internetA “haunted” Lego set with a ghost-catching app and a 3D version of the “blaster” guns from the Fortnite video game are predicted to be among the Christmas bestsellers at Hamleys, as toymakers bridge the gap between toys and screens.About a quarter of all toys sold in the UK each year are purchased in December and buyers at the retailer, famous for its flagship store on Regent Street in London, think the £55 Lego Hidden Side paranormal bus and £30 Nerf Fortnite guns will be topping children’s Christmas lists.

Pragmatic, liberal-minded, still in his thirties, he was a poster boy for the European establishment – living, breathing proof that the country had got its act together after the Silvio Berlusconi years.Then he became prime minister – the youngest in Italy’s history – and it all fell apart. In an attempt to dramatically extend the powers of his government, Renzi called an ill-judged constitutional referendum. He was heavily defeated and forced to resign. His fall from grace would prove fatal not only for his own reputation, but for that of Italy’s entire centre-left.Now Renzi is back in government, and eager to prove his mettle. His return is hardly surprising. Renzi has always been a skilled and Machiavellian politician. It was he who thwarted the plans of Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League, to force early elections and trigger a rightwing insurgency this summer. By going against the policy of his own Democratic party (PD) and opening talks with the Five Star Movement, Renzi succeeded in setting the conditions for a new coalition government, in which PD replaced the League.While little is yet known about its programme, the stated aim of the new parliamentary group – “to bring passion and participation back into politics” – is typical of the kind of hyper-optimistic and sometimes shallow rhetoric that propelled Renzi to power in the first place. The schism had been a long time coming. Even before Renzi, the PD had been ided down the middle between old “centrist” Christian Democrats and those with leftwing, socialist allegiances. Italia Viva’s 41 parliamentarians have so far come overwhelmingly from the former camp.Make no mistake, Renzi’s decision to bring down Salvini was motivated as much by self-interest as blocking the far right. The very fact that Italia Viva will remain part of the ruling coalition confirms that Renzi’s main goal in all of this was to reconstruct his once-powerful influence, and bolster his fellow centrist MPs. His gambit was made easier with the support of the EU, which has been particularly pleased to see the back of the Leauge. The surprise appointment of Paolo Gentiloni, a PD loyalist, as European commissioner for economic and financial affairs was, without doubt, a reward to the Italian centre-left for ousting the imprudent populists. Renzi, for his part, will be trusted by Brussels to contain the threat of political radicalism at home.By launching a new party, Renzi has been accused of undermining the new government. But that claim is short-sighted. For now, at least, he has pledged to support his ex-colleagues. Likewise, it remains to be seen how successful Italia Viva will be. Can it attract a sufficient number of PD rebels, and other waifs and strays, to become a serious political force? Or will it head the way of Change UK, another breakaway centrist group?For now, Italy is stable, but it’s a peculiar kind of stability. While the prospect of Renzi drafting policy once again may be reassuring for those seeking to defend the EU from the threat of a homogeneous “populism”, the long-term picture is more complicated. The real danger now is not that the government collapses overnight but that it ends up reproducing the kind of establishment politics that the Italian electorate has so vocally rejected in the last few years. Such a scenario would eventually prove fatal for all parts of the coalition. This, of course, is Salvini’s hope. With all of his opponents united against him, he is backed into a corner. If they fall, though, they will fall together.None of this is inevitable. While many have pointed to Renzi’s split from the PD as a loss for the party, it is also an opportunity. The Italian left has long been blighted by sectarian bickering and a lack of vision. Today, without the centrists who have left for Italia Viva, they have an unprecedented opportunity to develop a new path. And the party’s latest policies are, on the surface, intriguing. Among other things it promises a minimum wage, investment in the southern regions, and even some form of Green New Deal. The reality, though, is that most Italians have given up on the idea that such initiatives can ever be realised, and this latest round of cynical manoeuvring will only reinforce the sense of resignation that is so widespread across the country.For now, it’s still possible that PD and the Five Star Movement will manage to deliver their plans and outflank Salvini. If they fail, he will likely return to power, stronger than ever.• Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in Florence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/359049a420cab77f379049a29c82249dee3bf1d2/209_0_2170_1302/master/2170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35e43714aa1a8fff6847f6eeca778989","title":"tory moderates conservative party","story":"If Boris Johnson is capable of shame, then he should surely now be feeling it. He has brought this country to the point where an election is genuinely to be feared, no matter who wins, because of the violence that may follow where MPs facing death threats will need all the courage they can muster just to go out campaigning, and decent voters will switch off from the spite and hysteria surrounding them.It should go without saying that Johnson’s dismissive response to the Labour MP Paula Sherriff, when she challenged his deliberately provocative talk of surrender and betrayal over Brexit, was awful. Having listened in the past to Sherriff matter-of-factly describe the threats she has faced from the far right, and the depressingly elaborate precautions so many of her colleagues must take just to go about their everyday life, I too feel rage bubbling up at the idea that this was somehow faux concern. But what if rage is what they want, those determined to turn this next election into some kind of political hunger games? For only when we are goaded beyond reason, red mist descending at the slightest provocation, can they get the reaction their ide-and-conquer strategy needs.As Jo Cox’s widower, Brendan, gently pointed out this morning, political language is now sliding out of control on both sides. Emotions are running so high that we are all slightly losing the plot. The word “fascist” is cheapened by overuse on the left, along with talk of coups and unelected dictators and witch-hunts. There wasn’t much milk of human kindness on show in Brighton either, where Labour’s party conference began with an attempt to abolish Tom Watson and ended in reports of a grim little gathering outside the official conference fringe to protest against expulsions on the grounds of antisemitism. If it’s dangerous for Brexiters to toss around words such as traitor and surrender, it’s hardly edifying for the suspended MP Chris Williamson to compare party officials charged with rooting out this racism to “the Stasi”.To claim that hate-filled leftwing rhetoric doesn’t really count, because the far left hasn’t murdered anybody, meanwhile, is to overlook not only British Jews’ real fear of violence but the way one form of extreme language provokes another, driving everyone to the edge of things that should not be said. All of us have a choice over whether to pour more petrol on the flames, although that responsibility clearly weighs far more heavily on the prime minister than on anyone else.For all the understandable emotion in parliament, this may not prove much of a turning point for voters. The first rule of politics is that everything matters, but nothing matters as much as it would if more people were actually paying attention. Most voters are too busy cooking supper, supervising the kids’ homework or watching box sets to spend their nights glued to BBC Parliament, and millions are now so sick of Brexit that they are shutting out political news altogether. Among those interested enough to catch the headlines, remainers who fear the country is heading for dark places will have had their worst fears confirmed, while hard Brexiters who hate having their language policed won’t see what the fuss is about, any more than they did whenever Johnson casually tossed something incendiary into a newspaper column. But if it doesn’t shift entrenched political allegiances, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter.Should Johnson ever bring back the deal he says he wants, it’s now infinitely harder for Labour MPs who instinctively wanted to support it to vote with him. The pressure on moderate Tories still in government to quit rises hourly, and tensions within No 10 over Dominic Cummings’ aggressive tactics are bubbling to the surface. Downing Street sources – and I think we can all guess which Downing Street sources – came out swinging, comparing Johnson’s use of the phrase “surrender act” to describe the legislation aimed at preventing no deal with that notoriously inaccurate referendum pledge of £350m a week for the NHS. All controversy is good controversy, we’re told. Liberal outrage only bolsters the idea of a showdown between parliament and people.Well, maybe. Perhaps Johnson really did meticulously plan what he’d say to someone like Sherriff, rather than instinctively lashing out with only the vaguest idea of her history. But as the supreme court ruling suggests, the sledgehammer tactics that worked for Cummings in a referendum don’t always translate so well to Westminster. Much now depends on how well the man who once boasted of never having joined the Conservative party really understands the mood inside it, turning this week’s party conference in Manchester into a crucial litmus test.The night after the supreme court ruling, the former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron tweeted that he was seeing lifelong Tory voters switching on the doorsteps, reeling from what he described as a sense that “the Tory party has become uncivilised”. And if that’s exactly what a mischievous Liberal Democrat would say, you don’t have to scratch the surface of grassroots conservatism very hard to find a quiet unease even among activists who have been loyally knocking on doors for decades.They may have gone underground since David Cameron resigned, but there are still legions of instinctively Tory voters out there in what are no longer wholly safe Tory seats who value good manners, steady leadership and a quiet life. Many still hope that once Brexit is done, their party can return to what they regard as its senses. But it’s beginning to dawn on some that if that’s what they want, then they need to fight for it. If moderate Tories don’t find their voice in Manchester this week, they may wake up and find it’s too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2356ba6038e787905b6f78e073c26311b8400d46/0_194_3008_1805/master/3008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30d31cef749196f43a14a6dcf5c81c0e","title":"10 unmissable autumn experiences to have in british columbia","story":"From catching some waves off the Pacific Rim to getting up close and personal with the province’s abundant wildlife, or simply unwinding in the hot springs – autumn in British Columbia showcases British Columbia at its bestKayak with whalesEnter the realm of the whales on these multi-day tripsSpotting the whales that frequent the waters of British Columbia’s wild coast is an unforgettable experience, but Spirit of the West Adventures takes whale watching to the next level, with multi-day kayak trips into the realm of these magnificent creatures. Group tours depart from Quadra Island, which is just a 10-minute ferry ride from Campbell River, Vancouver Island, with various excursions available. It’s not all about the whales, either – paddling alongside the towering coastal cliffs and ridges, camping (or glamping!) in the wild, and tucking in to fresh, local food prepared by guides, all make for a once-in-a-life-time experience.Soak in hot springsSoak your body as you take in the viewsThere are hot springs all over British Columbia, so the question is not so much “where?”, as it is “where first?” For serious fans of a natural soak, the 530-mile Hot Springs Circle Route is a relaxing road trip worth taking, starting in the historic railway town of Cranbrook before winding through the breathtaking Kootenay Rockies with five scenic springs stops along the way.Horseback ride at Canada’s oldest guest ranchDiscover the prairies of the pioneersThe Flying U Ranch has been at the forefront of western culture since 1849, and as the oldest guest ranch in Canada it’s got some serious historical clout. Book a stay in one of the old west-style cabins on the shores of Green Lake, Cariboo, and settle in for an authentic ranch experience, including unsupervised horseback riding along trails that meander through meadows, forests, and groves of aspen. Enjoy your packed picnic lunch before heading back to the ranch’s Longhorn Saloon – a charming spot, perfect for quenching your thirst after a long day’s ride.Spend a night in the treesRelive your childhood treehouse fantasyIf the fact that every North American child in every North American movie has a treehouse bigger than most one-bed rentals in central London has always irked you, then BC has your back – because treehouse rentals are a “thing”.

Rent a bike, or a tandem if you’re feeling adventurous, and take in the sights from the comfort of your saddle, passing the futuristic dome of Science World, through the False Creek Marina, under the soaring feat of construction that is the Lionsgate Suspension Bridge and into Stanley Park, home to more than 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of temperate rainforest (yes, the word park is a bit of an understatement) just waiting to be explored.Go grizzly spottingIf you go down to the woods todayObserving grizzly bears in the wild can be a little tricky, as it is important not to disturb the creatures in their natural habitat. The good news is that bear-spotting tours allow you to do this in a safe and sustainable way, and several operate from the north end of Vancouver Island. Experienced guides will take you to the best spots to watch the famous grizzlies as you explore the island by covered boat or floatplane. The bears usually start “denning” in preparation for hibernation mid-November, so plan your trip accordingly.The handsome old port city of Prince Rupert was once a major point of trade and convergence for the region’s First Nations peoples. Now it serves as the stepping off point for the Haida Gwaii. The remote rainforested islands of Haida Gwaii are a nature-lover’s dream, with wild empty beaches, crashing surf, and wildlife at every turn. At the southern end of the archipelago lies the Gwaii Haanas national park reserve and Haida heritage site, the protected and preserved First Nation ancestral lands of the Haida people, where cedar longhouses, moss-covered canoes, and centuries-old totem poles all remain alongside ancient village sites. The heritage site offers several kinds of tours and talks, allowing travellers to learn more about spirituality and traditions of its First Nations people.Surf in UclueletGnarly, broOn the west coast of Vancouver Island lies the gem of Ucluelet, part of the Pacific Rim national park and home to more than 15 miles of long, sandy shoreline and rolling waves. It makes for some of the most accessible and scenic surf breaks in Canada, which are suitable for all levels of experience, year-round. So what are you waiting for? Book a lesson, wetsuit up from head-to-toe and go catch some waves. You could also head up into the nearby mountains with Long Beach Nature Tours, which runs backcountry hiking tours along the rainforest and coastal trails surrounding Ucluelet. Extend your trip with a visit to the neighbouring district of Tofino – a hub of activity with a slew of shops, restaurants, pubs and yet more beaches.Climb a mountainAin’t no mountain high enough …With a number of major mountain ranges ning British Columbia, you won’t exactly be hard-pressed to find hiking options – trails for all levels are as plentiful as they are beautiful. Just make sure you’ve got your camera with you: the views are guaranteed to be breathtaking. Guided hiking tours, such as Cove Adventures Hiking in Vancouver Island North, are also an option for those wanting to make the most of insider knowledge. If you’re visiting Vancouver and short-but-sweaty is your thing, try the Grouse Grind. Nicknamed “Mother Nature’s Stairmaster”, it’s a 2,380-step slog to the top of Grouse Mountain, and scaling it is a badge of honour for all visitors to the city.Wander with wolvesNot to be confused with the Kevin Costner film of a similar titleWalking with wolves is a reality thanks to the Northern Lights Wolf Centre in Golden, British Columbia. Yes – along with educating visitors on wolf conservation, the centre also offers the chance to join the resident wolf pack in their natural habitat on one of their exercise sessions in the park wilderness, just outside the borders of Yoho national park.

In August 2018, aged 15, Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in more than a dozen countries, in climate strikes that have become regular events. A global strike in March drew more than a million people, surpassed in September by the biggest yet with at least 4 million.Thunberg has described the rapid spread of the strikes around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walkouts to demand better gun controls in response to multiple school shootings.Veteran climate activists have expressed surprise at how much impact Thunberg has had on public awareness in such a short time.Thunberg has begun travelling to spread her message outside Sweden. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.”Born in Stockholm in January 2003, her mother is Malena Ernman, who gave up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father, Svante Thunberg, is an actor. Greta has Asperger syndrome, which has, her father says, in the past affected her health. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift that has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis.She has attracted criticism, particularly from rightwing commentators, who claim she is too young or naive to know what she is talking about and is being manipulated by her parents. One commentator on Fox News referred to her as a “mentally ill Swedish child”, for which the network was forced to apologise. She has rebutted these criticisms and shown that she can live her low-carbon values with a vegan diet and by sailing to New York, rather than flying.Thunberg has insisted she is just relying on the science. Rather than submitting prepared remarks before an appearance at the US Congress, she submitted a landmark IPCC climate report that warned of the rapidly approaching catastrophe of global heating, asking them to read it. She says: “I think that as long as they go after me personally with insults and conspiracy theories then that is good. It proves that they don’t have any arguments.

Her glare became a social media viral sensation.

Nor do I care about those who do not accept the science. I don’t have as much experience, and therefore I listen more. But I also have the right to express my opinion, no matter my age.

This is key to the success of Chloé, founded in 1952 and with a stellar designer alumni including Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney, Phoebe Philo and Clare Waight Keller. Chloé is interesting enough to be cool, but never so cool as to be intimidating. It is the Paris fashion week channel for contemporary culture’s obsession with the allure of French style.Now in her fifth season at Chloe, 39-year-old Ramsay-Levi made a bold statement by making it clear she had almost nothing new to say on the matter of getting dressed. Timeless chic and inidual style have always been more important than trend in the French philosophy of style, and this season Chloé, as the ultimate French-girl label, gave a Gallic shrug to novelty and trend.The show opened with an ivory silk blouse tucked into tailored dark trousers, worn with chunky gold jewellery and lots of black eyeliner. A silk blouse is the little black dress of the Chloé wardrobe, and was the star of this show – in café au lait or the pale pink of Camargue flamingos, with scooped neckline or trailing ribbon ties. Airy georgette dresses, delicately accordion pleated, floated at ankle length and were grounded with biker boots. Ramsay-Levi said: “A lot of this collection was about repeating looks I have already done. It was a statement – a sincere statement – that what I am doing is building a wardrobe which is not disposable. We are not making clothes that we expect you to throw away. This time around I didn’t try to add a lot of fashion novelty where we don’t need it. My point of view is becoming more mature. So the very first look was a blouse and a pant because those are perennial clothes, and the jacket this season is almost exactly the same as one I have done before.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5bbc26117aedb51e5ff9835b2bc61ae15748b7/119_685_1758_1055/master/1758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cc355b3f25620f85b8f8e5eb48f2588","title":"buckle up the 10 best trench coats in pictures","story":"From classic to cord, checked to colourful, this trans-seasonal staple is the perfect choice for when the leaves start to fall"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71f39287ad882fbc5d70107c43560cba4d5a1bda/0_236_2830_1698/master/2830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f36f704d794de4c4cd74395c450ee68","title":"britains queen of happiness a fairytale ending for silent film star betty balfour","story":"Once thought to be lost for ever, the 1923 rags-to-riches story Love, Life and Laughter has been found and restored, bringing Balfour’s magnetic charm to a new audience “There was once a happy little chorus girl who lived alone in a garret, and there was a lonely boy in the attic above, who wrote tales nobody wanted, except perhaps the girl.” The chorus girl is called Tip-Toes, and she is destined for great stardom. The young man, not so much.This is the fairytale scenario for a movie made in 1923 by George Pearson, an ambitious, occasionally self-aggrandising British director. It is a scenario that he reprinted in his florid autobiography, Flashback. The cheery chorine was to be played by Pearson’s protege, and one of the biggest stars in British silent cinema, Betty Balfour. The resulting film, Love, Life and Laughter, combines whimsy with realism to tell a story about optimism and ideals. Most importantly, it is a bespoke star vehicle for Balfour.Love, Life and Laughter opened to some impressive, if reserved reviews. The Manchester ’s CA Lejeune accused it of “tickling the intellectual vanity of its audience with a goose feather, coloured peacock by imagination”, but said it was “ambitious, spectacular … lit and photographed with a beauty to dream of”. Nevertheless, she rightly predicted it would be a hit.Unfortunately, Love, Life and Laughter soon became one of the great casualties of the silent era. For decades, it was thought to be lost, and was placed on the BFI’s list of “most wanted” films. So when a copy was discovered in the Netherlands in 2014, legions of Balfour fans, who had precious few chances to see her on screen, celebrated. And now the film has been restored by specialists at the BFI Archive and will have its world premiere at the London film festival in October, with live musical accompaniment by Meg Morley, the acclaimed jazz composer and pianist. Morley is also an expert in the art of improvising for silent cinema, and although, of course, this film has no soundtrack, its subject matter means that music takes on a vast importance.Balfour was an expressive comic with an infectious smile, and the historian Rachael Low wrote that she was “able to register on screen a charm and expression unequalled among the actresses in British film”. Not surprisingly, she was once thought to be the feather in the cap of our national film industry. She led a successful film franchise, playing a cockney flower-girl called Squibs, acted for Alfred Hitchcock in his silent film Champagne and was popular with audiences and directors all over Europe. However, she found it hard to shake her cockney typecasting and her career faltered in the sound era. She died in 1977, aged 74, and by the turn of the 21st century the reputation of the woman once known as “Britain’s Queen of Happiness” had gradually diminished – simply because the films she made were hard to see.So what can we expect from Love, Life and Laughter? Balfour’s presence on screen is as magnetic as it is charming if you have not seen her before, you may be surprised by the energy of her performance. She is constantly in motion, eyes twinkling and limbs snapping: a gamine with get-up-and-go. In this rags-to-riches story, she plays in the working-class mode for which she was most famous, but when she bursts out of that slum to become a star, she can indulge in the elegant 1920s glamour that suited her so well.It is a sentimental film, with a story-within-a-story narrative, and a central motif provided by a balloon-seller who lives in Tip-Toes’s tenement building: “The ’opes of young people is like the air in balloons,” he says. “The more ’ope, the ’igher you goes. Too much ’ope – bust!” Tip-Toes becomes a star while the author suffers rejection, but even at the height of her fame she misses him and remembers their promise to meet again. There are still some segments of the film missing – about 20 minutes over the course of the feature – mostly, it is thought, dealing with the young man’s story.There are some fascinating intersections of early 20th-century musical culture at play here, too. Pearson’s first inspiration for the film was Marie Lloyd, the music-hall star from east London who was celebrated for singing favourites such as The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery and My Old Man (Said Follow the Van), as well as for her saucy use of innuendo. Lloyd died a few days after collapsing on stage at the Alhambra theatre, Leicester Square, in 1922. That was just two years after Pearson first saw Balfour perform in the same venue and hired her for his film Nothing Else Matters (1920).In Love, Life and Laughter, Balfour dances and sings Oh! My Sweet Hortense, a popular American song first published in 1921 (“she ain’t good-lookin’, but she’s got good sense”) to her friends around the piano. In a Dutch print that survives, the song has been switched to Yes, We Have No Bananas – no doubt due to that song’s massive popularity on its release in 1923. It is a simple change in a silent film, just a matter of changing what is written on the title cards. So, likewise, Dutch audiences were told that the central character was called Squibs rather than Tip-Toes, rather like pretending Daniel Craig is always playing James Bond, no matter what the movie. In a different scene, Tip-Toes takes the young man to a jazz bar, where neon lights sizzle, a dancer performs the Shimmy, and a band plays the night away.Love, Life and Laughter is always poised between two worlds: success and failure, rich and poor, and the traditional and the modern. Just the kind of film that it is most exciting to revisit, with fresh eyes, nearly a century after it was first seen. It is certainly the kind of fairytale ending that Pearson would appreciate for this showcase for his favourite star.Love, Life and Laughter (1923) is at the BFI London film festival on 3 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b48a865cb43f65e33171626e21ca6b29e35b4ea9/0_2599_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01f8a2d2e0976ecb4c15a0c4aba55aa8","title":"20 best easy autumn recipes nigel slater meera sodha","story":"Fish curry, figs with pistachio biscuits, ceps with artichoke – the last in our series of easy autumn dishesA Japanese style “roast duck” that’s quickly seared and then cooked in brine for 10 minutes.

I love its pastoral elegance – it feels and tastes like you’ve stolen the soul from an autumn woodland. That feeling (accentuated perhaps by how many ciders you’ve drunk), is a testament to good ingredients and simple cooking. If you can’t find ceps or porcini mushrooms locally during the autumn months, then, of course, you can buy them online from a variety of wild- and foraged-food specialists. There are alternatives: firm, cultivated chestnut mushrooms would work really well, too.Serves 2Jerusalem artichokes 350g (about 6-8), peeled, skins reservedgarlic 2 cloves, bashed but skin onthyme 4 sprigsextra virgin olive oil 3 tbsp butter 1 knob sunflower oil for deep fryingcep mushrooms 2 large, cut into 1cm sliceschives 1 small bunch, finely choppedsalt and freshly ground black pepperHeat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Cut the peeled artichokes into 3cm cubes. Place the cubes into a roasting tray, with the garlic cloves, thyme sprigs and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season all over with salt and pepper, then place in the oven. Roast, stirring once or twice, for about 1 hour, or until the artichoke cubes are tender and caramelised. Squeeze the softened garlic flesh from its skin and place it in a blender with the roasted artichoke, the butter and just enough water to loosen, then blitz to a smooth, spoonable puree. Check the seasoning and keep warm.Wash the reserved artichoke skins, drain and pat dry (they need to be completely dry for frying). Heat 2-3cm of sunflower oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. When it’s hot enough for frying (170C on a cooking thermometer or when a cube of bread sizzles and crisps quickly), fry the skins in batches for about 1-1½ minutes each, until crisp and golden. Don’t let them get too dark or they will taste bitter. Drain each batch on kitchen paper, then season with salt and set aside.Heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat until hot. Season the mushroom slices with salt and pepper and place them in the pan. Fry the slices for 2-3 minutes on each side, until they have taken on some colour. Remove the pan from the heat and stir through half the chopped chives. Divide the artichoke puree between two plates. Arrange the fried mushrooms around this, then scatter over the crispy artichoke skin. From Gather: Everyday seasonal recipes from a year in our landscapes by Gill Meller (Quadrille, £25) Fish curries are among my favourite things to eat but too often their base is either tomato or coconut milk. This one is different, here the base is a beautiful spiced broth in which the celeriac is poached until you can mash it against the side of the pan using a wooden spoon and it thickens in the broth. It isn’t traditional, but it has warmth, body and spice, which are all good company in autumn.Serves 4rapeseed oil 4 tbsp black mustard seeds 1 tsp fresh curry leaves 12 onions 2, choppedginger 3cm piece, gratedgarlic 3 cloves, mincedgreen finger chillies 2½, finely choppedground cumin 1½ tsp salt 1 tsp celeriac 1 small (around 400g), peeled and cut into 3cm piecestomato puree 1 tbsp fish stock 750ml hake fillets 600g, cut into pieces (3cm)baby leaf spinach 100g lemon juice 1 tbsp to serve lemon wedges and basmati riceIn a large sauté pan or casserole, for which you have a lid, heat the oil and, when hot, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves. When the mustard seeds start to pop, add the onions. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the ginger, garlic, chilli, cumin and salt and cook for a further 5 minutes. Add the celeriac, tomato puree and stock, bring to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes.Once the celeriac pieces are tender, use a stick blender or potato masher to crush about 8 pieces of celeriac, to add texture to the sauce. Finally, add the pieces of hake and baby spinach, cover with a lid and simmer for 4-5 minutes until the spinach has wilted and the fish is just cooked through. Take off the heat, squeeze over the lemon juice, and serve with rice.Meera Sodha is a food writer and the author of East (Penguin, £20)Baked or poached fruits cry out for a crisp accompaniment – a ginger snap, perhaps, or a triangle of sugar-dusted shortbread.

Use a small knife to score the flesh of the aubergines in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through the skin. Mix the olive oil with the garlic, salt and pepper, and brush very generously all over the flesh of the aubergines. Place on a tray in the oven and roast, cut-side up, for 15-20 minutes or until the flesh is beautifully golden and feels soft when pressed. Remove from the oven.In the meantime, place the diced onion and oil in a frying pan over a high heat and cook until golden. Add the minced lamb and salt, keep the heat high and use a spoon to break the meat into little pieces so that it starts to brown. Mix in the spices and cook for 3-4 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree and 4 tbsp of water, and continue to stir while it cooks for a further 3 minutes.Spoon the mince onto the roasted aubergine boats, using up all the mixture, and spread to cover the cut surfaces.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!The fifth largest city in the UK with a population of almost 500,000 people, Liverpool’s history can be traced back to the year 1190, just the 702 before the formation of its eponymously titled local football club. On Thursday, in what was possibly the most eyebrow-raising football-related story The Fiver had heard until some Derby players motored past, it emerged that the club in question had its attempt to trademark the word “Liverpool” rejected by the government’s Intellectual Property Office due to the “geographical significance” of the city.The Big Cup holders had attempted to trademark the city’s name in order to prevent counterfeiters from flooding foreign and domestic markets with cheap, unofficial, mass-produced replica shirts and other bits of branded tat. The logic, presumably being that it would be a shame to lose out on so much easy money when they could flood both markets with over-priced, official, mass-produced replica shirts and other bits of branded tat themselves.We have been here before. Liverpool have already trademarked both the Liver Bird logo and the expression “You’ll Never Walk Alone”, and apparently have a similarly brazen attempt to do the same with “Allez Allez Allez” – a song their fans appropriated – in the pipeline. Nobody could accuse the good folk in their legal department of leading lives that are unfulfilled. Trademarking the name of “Liverpool” seems to have been an act of grasping corporate avarice too far, but club chief suit Peter Moore has taken it on the chin. Sort of.“It should be stressed that our application was put forward in good faith and with the sole aim of protecting and furthering the best interests of the club and its supporters,” he parped. “We will continue to aggressively pursue those large-scale operations which seek to illegally exploit our intellectual property and would urge the relevant authorities to take decisive action against such criminal activity wherever it exists,” he added, possibly mulling over future options involving the water in the Mersey, Jimmy Corkhill from Brookside and the observation deck of Radio City Tower.Having campaigned to prevent Fenway Sports Group, the owners of the club they support, from getting dibs on a word they rightfully claim “is not for FSG or anyone else to own”, Liverpool supporters’ group Spirit of Shankly described the IPO’s decision as a victory for common sense. “Without fan activism this issue may not have ended like this,” they cheered. “Without fan involvement there would be no challenge to the corporate greed within football. SOS remain vigilant to the stealth of the club in their relentless pursuit of money at any cost.” And who will watch these SOS watchmen? The Fiver hears Abba’s lawyers might already be on the case.“Part of the process of being a good record shop is listening to your customers and trying to get stuff in that’s going to appeal to them.

The hostia is the body of Christ, the holy host, the consecrated bread, and bloody brilliant – a Spanish equivalent of the dog’s dingly-danglies – and Real Madrid’s manager was right. What Rodrygo had just done was special where he had done it and when he had done it was, too. It was 10.30pm on Wednesday when Casemiro’s long, high diagonal reached him way over on the left. His first touch was impeccable, the ball tamed with the outside of his right foot, supposedly the wrong one, and coaxed into obediently joining him as he set off. Five seconds later, it was in the net.He was 94 seconds into his Real Madrid career.As the ball dropped, TV commentator José Sanchís had cooed: “Oh, I love that control.” As it hit the back of the net, he had shouted: “I can’t believe it.” All around him, they couldn’t believe it, either. Some 57,270 people leapt. Lots laughed, which is what you’re supposed to do when something like that happens. Suddenly, there was this 18-year-old they’d never seen play kneeling then bowing before the Bernabéu, doffing an imaginary hat, and all was well with the world.It had happened fast. Signed for €45m in 2018, Rodrygo didn’t actually join Madrid until this summer and hadn’t played a competitive game. At the weekend he didn’t even play for Castilla, the B team, for whom he had missed a penalty in his only appearance. Instead he travelled with the first team to Sevilla only to be left out of the squad entirely. “We know exactly what we’re doing with him,” Zidane insisted on Tuesday and the following night he stood on the touchline with his arm around the Brazilian’s shoulder, whispering in his ear. The clock showed 70.22 when Rodrygo ran on and, while it wasn’t actually the first ball he touched, 71.56 when he scored to make it 2-0 against Osasuna.“I don’t remember a debut like this,” Sanchís had said. Alongside him, Jorge Valdano noted: “It might not exist.”There have been pretty special starts for Madrid before: everyone remembers Robinho at Cádiz, David Beckham had scored 124 seconds into his first game at the Bernabéu and there may, genuinely, never have been a beginning quite like Jonathan Woodgate’s, which he neatly summed up in two words afterwards: “fuck” and “me”. But there haven’t been many like this. Only two foreigners have scored for Madrid younger than Rodrygo – Raphaël Varane and Vinicius – and no Madrid player has ever scored their first league goal faster. Only (original) Ronaldo, who’d been at Barcelona before, scored quicker on his Madrid debut: it took him 64 seconds.“If I could control it well, I thought the rest would come off well,” Rodrygo said afterwards, still in his kit, wearing flip-flops and looking every bit as young as he is. “I don’t really have the words for this. I’m lucky.”And so it starts the excitement, the expectation, the pressure. A few metres away, beneath the Bernabéu stands, Osasuna’s Fran Mérida, who joined Arsenal at 17, was asked if everyone risked running ahead of themselves. “Rodrygo’s the one running,” he said.Week six had been marked by kids, born after 2000. Six hundred kilometres to the north-east they were still talking about Ansu Fati, again impressing for Barcelona’s after a late cameo in a 2-1 win over Villarreal 350km away on the east coast, Kang-in Lee had just scored his first for Valencia in a wild 3-3 draw with Getafe. Aged 18 years and seven months, only two younger players have ever scored for the club. Over in Palma, meanwhile, João Félix scored the second in a 2-0 win over Mallorca. Atlético Madrid’s most expensive player ever, he’s still only 19.They are related, especially at Barcelona and Madrid. As the radios raved, some of the same things said about Fati come up again. Not least because, in that tiresome way that it’s always about them, the clubs that can’t live with each other and can’t live without each other either, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler going at it again. As if it’s not hard enough to live with your own club’s expectations you have to match the expectations of your rivals too. Yet the concerns expressed parallels as well, an awareness of what could go wrong, of the warping power of expectation and pressure.Back at the Bernabéu, Merida said: “I wouldn’t dare to tell anyone how to handle it there are no lessons.” Yet there are many: countless examples and warnings, reasons why people try to rein in their excitement, even if they can’t help it. There’s always that slither of fear lurking in the excitement, a reluctance to emotionally invest, a concern at getting too excited and getting hurt, a resistance to playing a part in potential going unrealised and the dream dying. No one wants to be responsible somehow. Or, worse still, wrong.There is a word used endlessly here that doesn’t translate well: ilusión. A false friend – and rarely has that description fitted better – it’s not illusion it’s more like hope, excitement, enthusiasm, joy, a dream even. And yet it can become an illusion too, sometimes precisely because of the ilusión. Bojan Krkic broke Barcelona records and it broke him for a while. Gerard Deulofeu was the best player many of them had seen. In the end, though, neither was the new anything. Robinho started as a saviour, but ended up as a triathlete in a joke: corre, bicicleta y nada, it runs and although it doesn’t translate it’s enough to know that, if a little unfairly, he became someone to laugh at.If Rodrygo (or the rest of us) needed any other warning, an indication of how hard it can be, there was also the man he replaced. The man? The boy. Light amid the gloom last season, the excitement building, a glorious future assumed and celebrated before it had actually happened, Vinicius’s performances had delighted but then dipped. He had suffered injury and hadn’t scored in 16 games. Chances slipped away, each more painful than the last. Then, at last, he bent a superb shot into the corner, taking a deflection en route. Madrid were 1-0 up and Vinicius slipped to his knees and sobbed, released at last.“Since my injury, everything was hard,” Vinicius said. “I wasn’t the happy person I am. I have lifted that weight off now and I’m delighted to please the Bernabéu again.”“I’m happy for them you could see the emotion when they scored, what it meant,” Zidane said. “We sometimes forget they’re both just 18.” Vinicius is actually 19 now, but the point remained. And for all the lessons, the warnings, there are examples that say the opposite. The ilusión is natural, it is right: it’s also the point. What is football, what is life, without it? Even the most rubbish teams live in hope. Iker Casillas was at school in a drawing class when they came for him he won the World Cup. Valdano confided to Raúl that he was thinking of playing him but worried that he might freeze. Raúl, aged 17, replied: “If you want to win, put me in if not, don’t.” He missed sitters that day, and became the best player Madrid ever brought through. And there was something about Messi.Besides, it is too often forgotten that there is dignity, joy and triumph in careers, even when they aren’t what others demanded they become. There is life beyond those teams. There’s a second chance. And a third, a fourth, a fifth. There’s also time. Ask Bojan, finding satisfaction in his success, no one else’s finding enjoyment too. Ask 37-year-old Jorge Molina Jaime Mata, who never even made it to primera until he was 29 and is now a Spain international or Aritz Aduriz, whose goalscoring figures improved after he turned 30. Or ask Martin Odegaard, who joined Madrid at 16, disappeared to most Spaniards, and has now reappeared aged 20, years still ahead of him and playing for Real Sociedad, with a genuine claim to be the best player in La Liga so far this season. Or Sergio Canales, able to be himself on his own terms, one of Spain’s outstanding players, an international many years and many injuries after that teenage move to the Bernabéu.Best of all, ask the two men who really marked week six in La Liga. Because while there’s a thrill in seeing young players suddenly emerge, there’s something special, maybe even deeper, in seeing the men who resist, who belie their years at the other end of the scale. If kids are alright, the adults might be even better. Especially when they are like these two, made to make you smile.Santi Cazorla is 34, has been operated on 10 times and was told he would be lucky to be able to walk around the garden with his son, but refused to give in and returned, still playing like no one else – included in last season’s best XI in La Liga, he may be on course for this season’s too. On Tuesday, he was handed a standing ovation by the Camp Nou, having outperformed everyone on the pitch and scored a brilliant goal. “That’s what I will take with me when I retire,” he said afterwards.And then there’s the man the Benito Villamarín rose to applaud a little over an hour earlier. Joaquín Sánchez left to an ovation after a ludicrous performance every bit as good as anyone of any age anywhere had produced for months. Everybody’s favourite cheeky scamp, he’s also a brilliant footballer still, maybe even better than he’s ever been. He provided three perfect assists as Betis beat Levante 3-1, and produced a piece of skill so brilliant, so absurd, so maddening, that all you could do was fall about the kind of trick that, as teammate Borja Iglesias put it, “really, really pisses you off” if you’re an opponent: a cola de vaca nutmeg, sweeping the ball through the legs of poor Toño that drew olés from everyone.Which was why on the day Fati proudly showed off his new, Spanish ID card, Joaquín was asked to show his too – to prove that really was his date of birth. There’s no way he could be 38, but he is. On Tuesday, Joaquín played his 874th senior game the day he played his first, Rodrygo hadn’t even been born."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef1cd89841af6b05d9d59617d622adce3e6cd86/0_229_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6f7dfde16047cdc2caee6be578318f9","title":"labradoodle inventor lifes regret frankenstein monster","story":"Wally Conron says he created a ‘Frankenstein’s monster’ as unethical breeders now make hybrids with serious health problemsThree decades ago, Wally Conron bred two unlike animals to unleash a creature the world had never seen. Today, he says it’s his “life’s regret”: “I opened a Pandora’s box and released a Frankenstein’s monster.”Conron decided to breed a poodle and a labrador following a request from a blind woman in Hawaii, who needed a guide dog that wouldn’t inflame her husband’s allergies. First he tried poodles, but they lacked the personality required for guide work, he told Australia’s ABC. The solution was “a dog with the working ability of the labrador and the coat of the poodle”, he said.He found a labrador mom and a poodle dad, and a resulting puppy, one Sultan, was deemed up to the task.It seems the trouble arose from an ensuing branding effort. According to ABC, Sultan’s two half-poodle-half-labrador siblings were struggling to find homes. So Conron, who worked for a guide dogs association now known as Guide Dogs Victoria, sought help from its PR department. “I said: ‘Can you get on to the media and tell them that we’ve bred a special breed? A breed called the labradoodle – it’s non-allergenic,’” he said.Demand for labradoodles soared. The name for this new hybrid breed was a selling point, Jessica Hekman, an expert on the species, told ABC. It meant people asked about their dogs could say more than just “she’s a mutt”.“When you start attaching cool names, then it starts turning into a new, cool story,” Hekman said.He expounded on his concerns about designer dogs – the offspring of two different purebreds – to Psychology Today in 2014: “All these backyard breeders have jumped on the bandwagon, and they’re crossing any kind of dog with a poodle,” without concern for potential health implications, he said. “There are so many poodle crosses having fits, problems with their eyes, hips, and elbows, and a lot have epilepsy.”He was so concerned, he said, that when he heard Barack Obama was considering getting a labradoodle, he wrote to him to advise against it. It’s unclear whether the president listened, but the Obamas ended up with a pair of Portuguese water dogs, also known for being hypoallergenic. (Politicians, however, are not immune to labradoodles’ charms: Michigan’s governor recently acquired one.)Not everyone shares Conron’s worries. A veterinarian told the BBC labradoodles are typically “happy, healthy dogs”, and they have topped polls on favorite breeds. Barney, for example, “has the perfect mix of lovingness, intelligence and everything”, labradoodle aficionado Martha Watton said.One clear drawback, however: from cavoodle to schnoodle to goldendoodle (shouldn’t it be goldenoodle?), it seems the labradoodle has fueled an outbreak of annoying names."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f86085dd510c5819ab21b839896e6d92144e251/0_2227_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fce0c4cf9b74ae361eea124569fc106f","title":"rick owens brutalist furniture","story":"His brutalist furniture has been inspired by rocks and bunkers. But the designer known for his gothic aesthetic has created a new range with a warmer influence – his mother’s homeland of Mexico. Has the ‘Donald Judd of fashion’ gone soft?This year, designer Rick Owens and his partner Michèle Lamy went to Mexico for the first time. “I’ve never really explored my Mexican heritage, even though my mother was from there,” says Owens. “But I was thinking about using it for my next clothing collection.” He returned to Paris inspired by what he’d seen. “Not the piñatas and the Frida Kahlo Mexico,” he says. “More the hot colours that Luis Barragán used, and Aztec architecture, and the photographs that Josef and Anni Albers took there in the 1930s, which I saw at the Guggenheim in Venice last year. Loud colours. And sequins.” Sequins? Colours? From the man who loves grey? “Yeah! I’m a flashy guy!” he giggles.Another, rather different, strand of influence emerged from the trip, seen in a new furniture collection that launched in London at Carpenters Workshop on 16 September. “We went to the cenotes in Tulum,” says Owens of the underground cave systems. “There was something about the enclosed spaces that felt insulated and grand at the same time.” Channelled through the designer’s brain, this culminated in a work called Glade – seating units that form an enclosed monochromatic landscape. “It’s like a hole in a forest,” says Owens, “which is what a glade is.” The seating, made with ply and covered in the grey vintage army blankets that have appeared in his work for two decades, comes fitted with internet and lighting connections. “I like the option of putting a hundred of them together,” he says. “You could fill a stadium with them. It’s like my version of wallpaper.”Owens’ clothing designs and muscly-goth image might imply a certain transgressive darkness, but his conversation is sparklingly bright, and runs from Egyptian sarcophagi (a regular stop on Louvre visits) to Cher videos (his favourite is Hell on Wheels, in which the singer wears a zebra-striped leotard over cycling shorts and rollerskates to a truck stop full of drag queens). When we talk, he is in his office in Paris’s classy 7th arrondissement. (He chose the area for its “imperious” quality.) Lamy is in London, installing Glade at Carpenters’ Mayfair gallery. While Owens comes up with the furniture concepts, it is Lamy – who cuts an equally unusual figure with her khol-rimmed eyes, dye-stained fingers and diamond-studded gold teeth – who carries them forward. “I do a few shapes, then she responds,” says Owens. “I might do sketches, maybe a cardboard sculpture. Then she goes to the workshop, which is an hour outside Paris, and works her magic. She likes constructing things – the bigger the better. Give her a crane, she’d be thrilled.” A series of eight Aztec-inspired crowns, which Lamy has also developed, cross the ide between the furniture and the clothes. They will be seen in the exhibition and on the catwalk in October. Owens describes them as “improbable and poetic”.Owens considers the furniture to be his couture line. “It’s custom-ordered, it moves at a stately pace,” he says. “Me, I like the speed of fashion, though partly because I have the privilege of being in charge of my own company.” Owens is just about the only thriving fashion house in Paris not to have been subsumed by a conglomerate. “I don’t have the pressure of bosses observing what I’m doing. I don’t know how those guys do it. But it’s thrilling to watch as a competitive sport, the way the players are traded.”Owens started his label in Los Angeles in 1994 and later teamed up with Lamy, who ran the Les Deux Cafe over the road from his studio on Las Palmas Avenue, first working as a pattern cutter for her fashion line. The pair moved to Paris in 2003 and married in 2006.Owens describes his earlier aesthetic as drippy. “There was a collapse implied and a sense of melancholy,” he says of the draped clothing, the sleeves that extended beyond the fingers. By his own admission, there was a lot of partying and drugs back then. “But as I got healthier and happier, there was a joyfulness in working with shapes. When you drape it’s always about creating extensions and exaggerating lines. I still drape, but now there is more strength in what I do.” Owens, then as now, looks to fashion’s archetypes – armour, uniforms, T-shirts. “I want to be the Donald Judd of fashion,” he says, referencing the American minimalist master. “I have a very rigorous set of shapes and forms I keep going back to.”Owens’ and Lamy’s furniture is often brutally restrained and bare. The materials are immutable – bronze and concrete, alabaster and marble. Kanye West has a table made in another favourite – petrified wood. “I love basalt and alabaster,” says Owens. “They’re almost biblical and primitive. When I’m making furniture I think of timelessness and I think of clothes that way too. The way they drape on the body has a classical influence.” The plywood of Glade, though, is its antithesis. “It’s opposite, transient. Like a Scotch Tape version of something.”Their home decor is brutalist too, with concrete floors and raw walls in Paris. Their beachside penthouse in Venice is lined with pale Sardinian stone. “It was very World of Interiors when we took it on, with a patchwork of 1940s tiled floors and Scarpa-style doors,” says Owens. “We lived in it like that for one summer, then we ripped it all out. There are floor-to-ceiling mirrored doors – you slip in and out of them, as though they’re mirrored walls.”The couple dine at the Aman Hotel in the 16th-century Palazzo Papadopoli. They travel by a water taxi that has been fitted out with a huge portable stereo, kept specially on charge for these journeys, that pumps out hard techno. Or Cher. “I’m not a foodie,” says Owens. “I don’t like those little places with low ceilings, where everyone tells you the food is wonderful but the bathroom is on the other side of a paper-thin wall. It’s disgusting.” In Venice he eats fish and vegetables. In Paris he eats cakes, because he likes the craftsmanship of their creation. “But really, I have cheap taste. I like cheese and ice cream. The sluttier the better.”This tension between taste and tackiness, control and collapse, is encapsulated in his growing love of art nouveau. “We all strive to reach a higher level of serenity, and there’s always the danger of giving in to our id, our weaknesses,” says the regular gym-goer. “That’s what art nouveau is, a lugubrious collapse. So it’s super sexy, and ominous, and it’s the only stuff I buy. We all need a little disruption. Don’t we?”Glade is at Carpenters Workshop until 25 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9adf199ee34a97f4a616ae286addfb3d52c5417b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e13cb6eefbc27ad6930201103a1296c","title":"how to your way into an ivy league school","story":"Journalist Evgenia Peretz discusses how US college tutor Rick Singer persuaded so many parents to take part in one of the biggest university scandals the Department of Justice has ever prosecuted.

Now in seventh place among the 227 MEPs with outside earnings, Farage earns about €360,000 (£319,000) a year from his media company, Thorn in the Side.The Brexit party’s London member Ben Habib is the EU’s best-paid MEP. Elected in May, Habib declared €960,000 annual earnings from First Property Group, the property fund manager he founded.Three other Brexit party MEPs make the top 10 ahead of Farage. At No 3 is Ann Widdecombe, who declared a second income of €240,000-€480,000 a year. The former Tory minister and reality TV contestant makes between €5,000 and €10,000 a month writing her  column, with a further €20,000 a month coming in from speaking and broadcasting.The Brexit party chairman, Richard Tice, has annual earnings of between €264,000 and €360,000 from his business interests.In 12th place is the Conservative Brexit evangelist Daniel Hannan, who is paid at least €5,000 a month to advise the machinery manufacturer JCB. Chaired by the Brexit-supporting Lord Bamford, JCB paid Boris Johnson £10,000 in January and has also had the former Brexit secretary David Davis on the payroll.Another prominent name in the top 10 is the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, who earns between €180,000 and €426,000 for sitting on company boards and giving speeches.All the outside earnings figures cited were before tax. Transparency International said the Brexit party contingent were “the top earners by a long way”, with its 28 MEPs earning a total of between €2m and €4.7m on top of their monthly MEP salaries of €6,825 after tax.The exact figures are unknown, as MEPs are only required to declare outside earnings in approximate amounts. The study reports MEPs annual earnings, but if Brexit goes ahead on 31 October, British MEPs would have sat for only four months of the current five-year term.About a third of the parliament’s 748 sitting MEPs declared income from second jobs.“Based on some of the details, including in some of the declarations of the Brexit party, it is impossible to judge what some of these companies are engaged in and therefore the exercise of determining if there is a potential conflict of interest is impossible to undertake,” said Nick Aiossa of Transparency International’s Brussels office. “Particularly with the sums of money involved with the Brexit party.”The group argues that the current system is too lax, fears fuelled by revelations that Farage failed to declare lavish funding from the Brexit tycoon Arron Banks.The Brexit party did not respond directly to questions about a potential conflict of interest, but issued a statement from the West Midlands MEP Rupert Lowe, who has the fourth-highest income from a second job. He earns between €204,000 and €444,000 from companies including a business running cancer treatment centres and another involved in solar energy.“Isn’t it wonderful that Brexit party MEPs earn more money than arch-federalist Guy Verhofstadt, and get a lot more votes than him as well,” said Lowe, who is one place ahead of the Belgian MEP.“Many Brexit party MEPs are successful in the work that they do, the decisions they make, and the earnings list reflects that fact. It’s important that voters who wish to attain the goal of leaving the EU have capable, experienced people to represent them to the best of their ability.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

Until 2015 nursing attracted an high number of mature students, who often already had debts totalling tens of thousands of pounds from paying tuition fees for their first course. Applications have declined since then.Sources close to the discussions say ministers are cautious about endorsing “debt forgiveness” as an inducement because it would cost too much money.Any financial incentives for nurses are likely to be made available only to certain groups, and not to everyone starting a three-year nursing degree. They would be targeted at mature students and those seeking to specialise in mental health and learning disability nursing, two areas in which workforce shortages are particularly acute.Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, has hinted at his support for reintroducing bursaries.Dame Donna Kinnair, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, welcomed the possibility of financial packages to persuade people to become nurses.Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said: “The commitment towards greater financial support for nursing students would be extremely welcome if implemented.“The shortage of nurses, and low rate of applications for training, shows that the current financial offer for nursing students is inadequate.“With a relentless rise in demand for care, today’s commitment would be progress towards filling these vacancies to ensure that services are safe and appropriately staffed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7377724544cc8e392d7746d578a6ebfb698c0cbe/686_339_5020_3011/master/5020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d8261fe4e702343648edf456a7fd12","title":"iaaf drop fastest loser world championships","story":"• Phrase will be replaced by ‘fastest non-automatic qualifier’• Concern that term might devalue athletes’ achievementsThe IAAF is discreetly moving away from using the term “fastest loser” on the eve of the world championships after complaints from some inside the sport and on social media that the phrase might devalue athletes’ achievements, the  can reveal.Reporters and commentators have been told the phrase “fastest non-automatic qualifiers”, which has already been adopted in some quarters, is more appropriate to describe athletes who do not win a race but make it through to the next round of competition.One well-placed source said: “I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s ‘banned’ but effectively yes.” Another joked: “Soon we’ll have to call them all winners … but some were just a little bit faster than the others.”The IAAF, however, insists the move is merely a sign of the times. As a spokesperson for athletics’ governing body put it: “There hasn’t been an official policy to drop the phrase ‘fastest loser’ but the move away from it reflects the evolution of the language. We want to recognise making finals or making it through a heat is a good thing, whatever place an athlete finishes.”With Qatar two hours ahead of Britain, much of the world championships will be shown in primetime on the BBC. That should provide a rare showcase for a British team that the UK Athletics performance director, Neil Black, insists is “incredibly well prepared” and primed to do better than many expect.However, Black said the 1500m star Laura Muir, one of Britain’s most reliable medal hopes alongside the sprinter Dina Asher-Smith and heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson, was not in ideal shape as she attempts to recover from a calf injury sustained in July.“Laura doesn’t have to race a lot to be able to race well,” said Black. “It’s about getting there in a week’s time and the biggest challenge is the obvious one of three races in four days. That’s the bit that’s kind of unknown. Laura will be there in good shape. And then we’ll all see what the outcome is.”When pressed about her condition, Black added: “Everything suggests she’s in good shape, progressing towards great shape. The honest phrase is Laura Muir is still going to be competitive to win a medal.”A spectacular 10 days of athletics almost certainly lies ahead. In the men’s 200m the American Noah Lyles says he is going for Usain Bolt’s world record, while the long-standing world record for the 400m hurdles could be broken by any one of Karsten Warholm, Abderrahman Samba or Rai Benjamin, the son of the former West Indies fast bowler Winston.On the women’s side, the Belgian Nafi Thiam is aiming to show again she is the best female athlete on the planet in the heptathlon while Asher-Smith is bidding to become the first Briton to win three medals at the same world championships.However, many inside the sport are nervous about the potential poor crowds after the ’s story this week about only 50,000 tickets being sold – which will lead to migrant workers and children with free tickets being bused in. For context, 700,000 people watched the same event at London 2017.Richard Kilty, who is captaining Britain, believes the sport needs an injection of razzle and dazzle to appeal to more fans. “I think we need to do a better job of building the image of our athletes,” he said. “Eddie Hearn has just rejuvenated boxing completely by creating rivalries and then suddenly everyone’s a boxing fan now. I think it’s going to take someone like him to come in and slightly change the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad540f9583b69bef01129394bd1e90c70218c09/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ffe4de37c75581e18ef9840bb5b685a","title":"our teachers whooped for avenue q readers pick the 21st centurys best theatre and dance","story":"Following our selection of this century’s best new plays and dance shows, readers give their reactions and suggestions – from Book of Mormon to The Red Shoes‘Best thing I have seen’: Chris135I put off seeing Hamilton until a couple of months ago on the basis it would be over-hyped, preachy, woke and way too much money. Also the fear that if it was as good as rumoured, I would end up some annoying evangelical banging on about it constantly. It’s the best thing I have seen in my life. If you haven’t seen it: beg, steal or borrow the money and get a ticket.The most beautiful, heartbreaking piece of theatre I’ve ever seen.‘Emotional and spectacular’: Nomadteacher205My favourite dance experience of the last decade. The first half was a slightly languid affair, but the second half was outstanding, emotional and spectacular in equal measure.The Danny Boyle production of Frankenstein at the National theatre was incredible.‘It should be there’: Iron MikeThe Mother with Osipova should be there as should anything with the great Zakharova.‘Guillem looked like she was bathed in flames’: BrightdaylerPush is indeed fantastic, but I also love the solo Two, choreographed by Russell Maliphant in Two: Four: Ten. I was lucky enough to see both performed more than once. When I saw Two at the London Coliseum, during the more animated segments Sylvie Guillem looked like she was bathed in flames. It was one of the most stunning things I’ve ever seen (along with the opening of the balcony scene in the Budapest Opera House’s Romeo and Juliet).The Book of Mormon was pretty damn fabulous, and deserves a place on this list.The Book of Mormon – obviously. Nemo81What, no Book of Mormon?! YorkshireExPatKinky Boots is easy to dismiss as flippant, but it’s a very poignant story dealing with a lot of deep issues, with heart and laughter, tears and great fun combined. Matt Henry as Lola was just incredible – Olivier and MBE very well deserved. I’m not in London nowadays but made the trip to see this several times. I’m very excited to catch it on tour next month, can’t wait!It proved to be one of the most exhilarating nights I have ever spent in the theatre.Michael Clark’s work was absolutely stunning. Its combination of precision and energy was a joy I found it a wonderfully dynamic and hypnotic work.We saw Avenue Q on a school trip and our English teachers whooped and clapped embarrassingly loudly after What Do You Do With a BA in English?‘Not sure I’d seen anything like it before’: RobRoy1975The Lehman Trilogy was an impressive bit of theatre – not sure I’d seen anything like it before.After The Encounter it was the best piece of pure storytelling I have seen this millennium. KentishTownie‘Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience?’: NDL1234Slightly surprised that there is no mention of Akram Khan’s Abide With Me at the London 2012 opening ceremony. Has a piece of contemporary dance ever had a bigger audience? Many of whom commented on just how moved they were by something they had not been exposed to before.A small but perfect piece of theatre by The Wooster Group, featuring Eric Berryman. This piece had a quiet stillness, spare set and the magnificent voices of Eric Berryman, Jasper McGruder and Philip Moore all coming together perfectly to bring to life the pain and pathos of work songs, spirituals, and toasts recorded in 1964 in Texas’s then-segregated prison farms. It’s a piece of theatre that exemplifies the very special and unique value of live performance.‘Hilarious and poignant’: freewheelingfrankieI loved Graeae Theatre Company’s by turns hilarious and poignant Reasons to Be Cheerful, which did superb justice to most of Ian Dury’s best songs and wove them into a rite-of-passage story that was much more than a contrived excuse for playing them.‘Blew me away’: dude1981The Flick deserves its spot. Blew me away. Felt like I was seeing someone of my generation writing a play for someone like me.‘Hilarious and scary’: BacteriaThe Pillowman by Martin McDonagh was the most enjoyable new play I saw this century. Hilarious, scary, constantly surprising and finally intensely moving. It screams out for a major revival.‘Thrilling, gorgeous and joyous’: richardthomsonShobana Jeyasingh’s Counterpoint, performed in 2010 as a Cultural Olympics test event, filled the whole of the fountains area of Somerset House. Big-scale, fast, expansive, lovely patterns, lots of performances so easy to go and see and above all, thrilling, gorgeous and joyous. There was a lot of good outdoor and site-specific dance all over London in 2010 and 2012. It feels like a different world now, never mind a different country. It will never happen again.‘So good I saw it twice’: ThespionicGirl from the North Country is definitely one of the best I’ve seen and certainly the best vocalssongs.

Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet – once you’ve experienced tangle-free listening, you’ll never go back.Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it’s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here’s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.This  buyer’s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 26 September, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.Nailing the combination of connectivity, sound, in-ear comfort, controls and case size has proved far more difficult for truly wireless earbuds than you might expect. Thankfully Samsung has managed it on the third try.The Galaxy Buds are small, light and comfortable earbuds, with a traditional silicone tip on one end and a small body that sits within your concha, even if you have fairly small ears, allowing you to completely forget about them. They come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them, but stay put perfectly fine without them.A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. It all works very well, although I wish you could trigger ambient sound on pause.The Galaxy Buds sound pretty good too, with reasonable sound isolation and a well-rounded tone most will like. They’re fairly balanced, not overly dominated by bass or treble, with good separation and punch where needed. The buds are capable of uncomfortable volume levels when cranked right up and there’s a limited EQ available in the Galaxy Wearable app. Audiophiles might turn their noses up, but they sound good compared with the competition at this price.Bluetooth connectivity between the buds and to the phone is rock solid, regardless of whether you’re using a Samsung or other phone. They can be used as a stereo pair, inidually and hot-swapped between left and right in mono without skipping a beat, even when on a call – something only Apple’s AirPods have been capable of until now. The Galaxy Buds support AAC and Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec for high-quality music, with no noticeable lipsync issues even when connected to a non-Samsung device. Call quality is good, but a little distant similar to when you’re on speaker phone.Even the case is really good. It flips open and closed with a satisfying snap, is small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and provides just over one full charge of the earbuds. Combined that means the Galaxy Buds will last up to six hours of continuous playback with an additional seven hours in the case. In practice that means having to charge them once a week for the commute via the USB-C port or even wireless charging on any Qi-compatible pad or phone.Pairing with an Android phone with Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app installed is as easy as opening them up and waiting for the prompt. Everything else needs a quick trip into the settings menu like any other Bluetooth device. They worked well with various Android phones, PCs, iPads and iPhones.The Galaxy Buds offer the best combination of sound, connectivity, size, comfort case and price, making them the ones to buy for Android unless you don’t like canal-buds.Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that just workDon’t buy if: you only use iOS or don’t like canal-budsThird time’s the charm for Sony. The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless.Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). Controls are good, but lack volume on the earbud. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They’re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy.Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are the best-sounding true wireless earbuds yet.Buy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancellingDon’t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendlyIf you don’t like blocking out the world, or can’t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple’s AirPods, now in their second generation.They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won’t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple’s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.Where they fall down is on-board controls - there’s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There’s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.With the second generation AirPods you can also just say “Hey Siri” at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple’s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.The AirPods’ other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (£40$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android usersBuy if: you use Apple products and don’t need sound isolationDon’t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside worldIf you want the smallest, most discreet wireless earbuds available, the Earin M-2 deliver. These tiny earbuds sit within your ear with only a flat touch-sensitive surface visible.Available in black or white, they’re light and easy to forget you’re wearing them. They produce a balanced, relatively flat sound with good treble and fairly crisp highs. Those looking for pumping bass or truly sparkling audio will have to look elsewhere, but they make a good go of most music genres.An Android or iOS app sorts updates, and tweaks transparency settings, but there are no equaliser settings.Noise isolation is good but not great. The M-2s can feed ambient sound in when the music pauses, but it sounds like you’re listening to the world down an old phone line - fine for listening to an announcement but it takes some getting used to.Unusually, there’s no left or right earbud. They can be inserted in either ear with the buds working out which way round they are, and either can be used on its own for mono listening. They support AAC and aptX, and maintain a stable connection to your phone and between the earbuds, which communicate via magnetic induction, not Bluetooth. The result is lag and lipsync issue-free audio. Call quality is good, but a little quiet, meaning you’ll have to speak up, and there’s no sidetone, so it’s difficult to know how loud you’re talking.Tap once to pause, twice to skip track or tap and hold to invoke Google Assistant or Siri on either bud. The controls work well, but there’s no volume control at all, so you’ll have to reach for your phone for that.They last a good three hours of constant playback and charge about three times in the cylindrical aluminium case, which slides open and shut with a satisfying clunk.If you want your truly wireless earbuds to be as small as possible, but still have good sound, great connectivity and a good case, the Earin M-2 are it.Buy if: you want the the smallest of truly wireless earbudsDon’t buy if: you want a smaller case or better soundIf you wish Apple’s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro.Like the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They’re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout just don’t run them under a tap.The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It’s robust and works just fine, but you’re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They’re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren’t for you.You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that’s unshakeable.Buy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won’t come off no matter what you doDon’t but if: you want something smaller and cheaperCreative, known for PC soundcards and MP3 players from the 90s and 2000s and now gaming headsets and headphones, produces some of the best value true wireless earbuds around.The Creative Outlier Air (also available in a more expensive “gold” variant) manage to tick almost every box. They’re light and comfortable to wear for extended periods, with a kidney shape that keeps most of the hard plastic body away from the fleshy bits of your ears. A traditional silicone earbud tip holds it in place fairly well, but only two sets are included in the box, meaning you might need to buy some extra ones if it doesn’t make a good enough seal.They have excellent connectivity with Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC and aptX support, can be used independently and best of all last up to 10 hours between trips in the case, which is about double the average battery life of most true wireless earbuds.The case is fairly big, but is light, just about pocketable and holds two full charges of the earbuds, making up to 30 hours before needing to be topped up by USB-C.The Outlier Air sound surprisingly good for the money too, producing well-rounded audio with punch in the bass (once you get a good seal at least) and good clarity in the mids and highs. They won’t touch the best-sounding, but they are a cut above the competition at this price and will even give the likes of the Galaxy Buds and AirPods a run for their money.A button on either bud takes care of playback and volume control, which is a bit stiff, requiring you to grip the bud with your index finger and press the button with your thumb. Press once to pauseplay, twice on the left to skip back or on the right to skip forward. Pressing and holding on the left turns the volume down or on the right turns the volume up.Call quality is surprisingly good, with only a little bit of background noise audible by the recipient while speaking. The earbuds are also IPX5 sweat-proof so fine for a run or similar. Small niggles include poor selection of earbud tips, a slight hiss on pause and hints of lipsync issues with Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.Great sound, connectivity and long battery life, plus solid controls including volume, combine with an OK case to make some excellent value true wireless earbuds.Buy if: you want great-sounding truly wireless earbuds on a budgetDon’t buy if: you want a small case (buy the Anker Liberty Air instead)There are many different types of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but the newest and neatest are the truly wireless earbuds.Unlike neckband earphones or regular Bluetooth earbuds, truly wireless earbuds have no cables connecting between them, freeing the wearer of all cords and cables.Removing all cables means transmitting audio and data between them through your head, which is not an easy task. Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts.A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony\u0027s LDAC and Qualcomm\u0027s aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some.Apple\u0027s iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX.Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues.Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem.Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what\u0027s happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEach earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges.Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket.Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place.Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don’t fit the bill.Anker’s AirPod-like true wireless earbuds are second only to the Creative Outlier Air as the best budget option. They have good but not great sound, solid connectivity and AAC support in a light and comfortable earbud design with stalks.Controls are basic, with no volume control, but call quality is excellent and the case is one of the smaller and easier to pocket variety. You’ll get four hours out of the earbuds and an extra three charges in the case.Anker’s smaller true wireless earbuds are an excellent budget option, but have a larger case and are bettered on sound and call quality by the Liberty Air. They can be found for slightly cheaper and don’t have the AirPod-like stalk design, so are still worth buying if the price or earbud design suits you better. Not good for phone calls though.B\u0026ampO’s second-generation E8 are a solid mix of sound quality and connectivity with a fairly small case. They last just under four hours’ playtime, with two full charges in the case, which itself is charged via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. Touch panels on each earbud take care of controls, including volume, and they have an reasonable transparency mode too. They support AAC, can connect to two devices simultaneously, but can’t be used independently. Call quality is reasonable.The biggest issue is their size: the E8s are massive for earbuds and don’t feel all that stable in your ears unless you use the included Comply foam tips. They’re also expensive and bettered by the Sennheisers on the audio quality front.If you want more isolation than the AirPods but can’t get on with canal-bud style tips, the Bose SoundSport Free provide a good halfway house. The StayHear+ tips rest in your concha but don’t enter your ear canal, holding themselves in-place with a flexible fin.They sound good, connectivity is rock solid with AAC support, call quality is really good, and they last more than four hours between charges. The large case provides two full charges. The biggest problem is that they’re huge and stick out your ear a mile. At least the call quality is good.The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 come very close to delivering on all counts. They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio.The case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best.The problem is, they’re huge. They have a really large aperture making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols’s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame.The Jabra Elite 65t are a good alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Buds. They have rock-solid connectivity, support for AAC, no noticeable lipsync issues and sound good, with punchy, controlled bass plus a full equaliser in the Jabra Sound+ app.There are volumetrack skip buttons on the left earbud and a pauseplay button on the right, which activates ambient sound when double pressed. Call quality is good with clear voice, but background noise bleeds into the mic a little. The case is pretty compact and charges the buds twice totalling to 12 hours’ playback.The Elite 65t twist to lock in place in the ear, but are fairly large and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions for smaller ears.Some of the best true wireless earbuds available, the Track Air+ are narrowly beaten by the Samsung Galaxy Buds for general earbuds on price and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 on noise cancelling.The Libratones have it all: attractive design, rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with aptX support, great sound and even reasonably effective noise cancelling. Add to that a tiny case that’ll fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans just like the Galaxy Buds and AirPods, and has wireless charging. Plus battery life of just shy of six hours and three charges in the case. They’re even sweat resistant.The downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case. Still, if you wish Apple made noise-cancelling AirPods with silicone earbud tips for a better fit, the Libratone Track Air+ are the ones to buy.If the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless don’t fit the bill but you want great sound, then the Master and Dynamic MW07 are worth a look.They sound good, with pronounced bass and crisp highs, but fall slightly short of the better-sounding Sennheiser. There’s a slight hiss when nothing is playing, but have rock-solid connectivity with AAC and aptX support. The buds are also fairly large and certainly a statement in piano gloss. The wings are a bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t need them.The case is medium sized, and feels good in the hand, but is heavy and the earbuds don’t quite snap into place unless the lid is closed. Physical buttons for controls are great, including volume. Calls sounded echoey.Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect sound good with strong bass and solid isolation, but poor call quality.Connectivity is pretty good including AAC support, with only a very occasional blip while suffering only minimal lipsync issues with video. Latency is more of an issue with games. They last four hours per charge, with four full charges in an attractive, medium-sized case.A button on each earbud handles volume, track skip, pause, play and the voice assistant all accessible with multiple clicks. The button felt mushy on one set requiring replacement.Previously ranked as the best-sounding true wireless earbuds, the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless are still great. The earbuds are quite large, but are comfortable with a solid set of earbud tips. They last up to four hours between trips in the case, which itself is one of the better ones, although not quite as pocketable as the best.Connectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with AAC, aptX and the new aptX Low Latency codecs, and no hint of latency issues. Call quality was good but a bit distant. Silver touch pads handle playback and volume control.The best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, with produce crisp highs and deep bass, sounding great with most music genres.The Tranya T3 are a solid set of budget true wireless earbuds with a reasonably bassy sound, good connectivity and AAC support. A button on each earbud takes care of controls. Isolation is fairly weak and the case is pretty bulky and easily marked. Call quality was abysmal and there was a small lipsync issue with YouTube on an iPhone.CrazyBaby Air Nano – Connectivity and latency issues – £70Jabra Elite Sport – Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite 65t – £200Jaybird Run – Solid for runners, but unacceptable latency issues – £159JBL Free X – Large case and terrible latency issues – £120JLabs JBuds Air – Sound fine, but only SDC support means latency issues – £50NuForce BE Free8 – OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues – £200Rowkin Ascent Micro – small, sound OK, but serious latency issues – £125Skullycandy Indy – Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone – £70Taotronics BH053 – sound OK, but cheap plastic with questionable durability and lag with YouTube – £38TicPods Free – Good sound and controls, but terrible latency – £120Urbanista Stockholm – AirPod ripoffs with poor fit and weak sound – £89 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

ByteDance, the Beijing-based company that owns TikTok, says the moderation guidelines were replaced in May.As well as the general moderation guidelines, described as the “loose version” to moderators, TikTok ran at least two other sets.One, the “strict” guidelines, were used in countries with conservative moral codes, and contained a significantly more restrictive set of rules concerning nudity and vulgarity, which ban, for instance, “partially naked buttocks”, exposed cleavage with “a length of more than 13 of the whole cleavage length”, and lengthy depictions of sanitary pads.The other was a set of guidelines for inidual countries, which introduced new rules to deal with specific local controversies – but also further restricted what can be shown. For instance, the  has seen Turkey-specific guidelines in which TikTok explicitly banned a swathe of content related to Kurdish separatism, and adds the country’s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, to the list of political leaders who cannot be criticised, defamed or spoofed on the platform.TikTok is a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers. Users film themselves in 15-second clips, typically set to music, and upload them to be viewed by followers and strangers alike. It has been the No 1 app on the worldwide App Store for five consecutive quarters, with an estimated 500 million users worldwide.Owned by Chinese startup ByteDance, the app as it is today is a merger of the original TikTok, which was launched internationally in September 2017, and the viral sensation Musical.ly. The latter had already become one of the most popular social media platforms for UK and US teenagers by the time it was purchased by ByteDance in November 2017. The merger meant TikTok ended up on the smartphones of more than 60 million users overnight.Bytedance has a valuation of $75bn (£60bn), based primarily on the extraordinary growth of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin. Lil Nas X found fame overnight when his track Old Town Road was used extensively on 15-second clips on the social network. That enthusiasm took the artist to a record-breaking run at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.However, Bytedance was fined a record $5.7m in the US for illegally collecting personal information from children under 13, and has been under investigation in the UK for how it handles the personal data of its young users, and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network.And an entire section of the rules was devoted to censoring depictions of homosexuality. “Intimate activities (holding hands, touching, kissing) between homosexual lovers” were censored, as were “reports of homosexual groups, including news, characters, music, tv show, pictures”. Similarly blocked was content about “protecting rights of homosexuals (parade, slogan, etc.)” and “promotion of homosexuality”. In all those guidelines, TikTok went substantially further than required by law.The country-specific guidelines took on a new relevance following the ’s initial reporting on TikTok’s censorship, in which ByteDance said that the guidelines had been retired in May in favour of “localised approaches, including local moderators, local content and moderation policies, local refinement of global policies”.The Turkey and Strict versions of the moderation guidelines suggest those localised approaches may not be less censorious than the previous centralised approach.In a statement, TikTok said it was “a platform for creativity, and committed to equality and ersity”.“Our platform has experienced rapid growth in Turkey and other markets, and as we grow we are constantly learning and refining our approach to moderation. The referenced guidelines regarding LGBTQ content in Turkey are no longer in use, and we have since made significant progress in establishing a more robust localised approach. However, we recognise the need to do more and we are actively working with local third parties and independent advisers to ensure our processes are appropriate.” also reported that TikTok took the unusual approach of erring on the side of risk when it came to sexualised content featuring children: videos of them wearing “sexy outfits” or “dancing seductively”.The platform’s guidelines advised moderators to treat subjects as though they were over 18 if their age was unclear, while other platforms instead recommend their moderators take the side of caution, particularly if the content has been reported as underage.Andy Burrows, the NSPCC’s head of child safety online policy, criticised the approach, and said: “These guidelines demonstrate that TikTok has woefully failed to grasp the seriousness of child abuse imagery.“Furthermore, TikTok is taking a cavalier approach by telling moderators that if they aren’t sure whether someone is a child or not, to assume they are an adult.“Ultimately, TikTok needs to fundamentally reassess its attitude to handling inappropriate images of children on its site. The fact that they use wholly unsuitable language like ‘underage pornography’ and ‘sexy outfits’ to describe this horrific content speaks volumes.”TikTok says it has since reversed the policy, and now requires moderators to treat people as under 18 if there was any doubt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830b4b5b0b4f4bed5b20dfc9c8dabd719b3bab20/0_121_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7ad73ffa94e5d5cd1811f80d2be277","title":"send us a tip on a modern building or space in europe and win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"An amazing looking bar or hotel, a jaw-dropping museum, a radical revamp of an older building … share your design favourites from the UK and elsewhere in EuropeTell us about the eye-catching modern architecture and interior design you’ve loved and lingered over on your European and UK travels.

They will become the first line of defence in conservation.”While the main hubs of Chilean Patagonia – Punta Arenas, Puerto Montt, Balmaceda, and the Torres del Paine national park – already have well-established tourist infrastructure, Tompkins hopes communities across the region will see the Route of Parks as an opportunity to start tourism ventures for all budgets. “We want backpackers and people who can only afford to camp – we want an assortment of offers.”A team from the foundation has already travelled around Patagonia visiting towns and villages to talk about the reason for the parks’ existence – to “throw the brake on the extinction crisis” by restoring the landscape to its natural state and where necessary reintroduce endangered species – and to encourage local people to establish tourist services that will create income for communities and contribute to the long-term preservation of wild habitat.The Tompkins Foundation has developed trails and infrastructure in two of the five new parks, Parque Patagonia and Pumalín – the former has two small lodges, three campgrounds and a visitor centre the latter has nine cabins and a network of campgrounds. But the aim is for communities to develop low-impact accommodation, guide and transport services, cultural tours and more around all the parks.As a result, vast swaths of Patagonia such as the spectacular but overlooked Aysén region will become more accessible, taking the pressure off Torres del Paine, where the W trail is so busy in peak season that travellers have complained of overcrowding.Starting in northern Patagonia, Route of Parks is an epic scenic highway taking in three existing routes: the Carretera Austral road between Puerto Montt and Villa O’Higgins, the central fjordlands (accessible by ferry only) and the End of the World route in the far south, ending at Cape Horn. The launch of the route – which is broken down into different itineraries on the website – follows the creation of five new national parks and the expansion of three others, all in Chilean Patagonia after the Tompkins Foundation handed over a million acres to the Chilean state – the largest private donation of land ever.The handover was the culmination of 25 years of strategic land acquisition by Kristine and Douglas (who died in a kayaking accident in 2015), aimed at returning farmed land to its natural state and creating wildlife corridors. The Foundation also owns land in Argentina, where its flagship rewilding project is seeing species being reintroduced to the newly created Iberá national park in the north-west. In January, three jaguars will be introduced. In total the Tompkins’ philanthropic work amounts to $345m.Tompkins said she was still shocked at the successful outcome of her and her husband’s vision which began in 1991 with the purchase of 200,000 acres at the toe of Reñihué Fjord in what is now Pumalín national park. “We made the outrageous proposal to create five parks and expand three more and I’m still dumbfounded that it reached its conclusion.”Over the decades a multitude of rewilding projects have included removing 25,000 sheep and 500 miles of fencing in what is now Parque Patagonia, the recovery of endemic species including guanacos, Andean deer, and Darwin’s rhea and encouraging well-managed agriculture to serve as biophysical buffers.To date the Foundation has helped protect 5.75 million hectares across Chile and Argentina. The next phase is ensuring its long-term protection by setting up Amigos de los Parques (Friends of the Parks), a scheme to encourage Chileans to feel a pride in their national parks system a private-public fund to ensure the parks are properly maintained and the establishment of the Route of Parks to promote the region locally, nationally and internationally.Looking back over 25 years of philanthropic work, she said her proudest achievement was the creation of Kawésqar national park, a vast region of mountains, forests, glaciers, fjords, lakes, wetlands and valleys of the west coast. The Tompkinses owned 28,000 hectares of it and used it as leverage to persuade the state to give 4 million hectares to form the second-largest national park in Chile (after Bernardo O’Higgins). About 26,000sq km of surrounding water is also protected.Future conservation work will focus on areas where land meets sea with the aim of winning protection for marine areas. Ever ambitious, Tompkins is going for the highest level of protection there is: “We are trying to get waters established as no-take zones.”Alongside the continued conservation work across the region, Tompkins said she wanted to position the foundation as a supporter of the youth climate activism movement, both financially and in terms of direct involvement. “I personally want to be involved and I want my teams to be involved. We should be joining the marches. If there is no march in an area where we work, we should help support one.• See a comprehensive map of the Route of Parks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33437f4bea9094b37dac6bda8fe76575b140f7f9/0_144_2520_1512/master/2520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf29137d8d59f43409fd7b2d412027b","title":"pivot your favourite moments from friends","story":"The holiday armadillo, Danny DeVito as a policeman stripper, Brad Pitt’s I hate Rachel club ... here are readers’ best bits from FriendsThe aftermath of the Vegas wedding (and Ross not arranging the promised annulment) produced some of my favourite Chandler lines: “I couldn’t face the idea of another failed marriage” “Well. Can I ask at what stage you considered this to be a successful marriage?” and: “Ross, just for my own peace of mind, are you secretly married to any more of us?” mattyjjI love the one where Danny DeVito played the male stripper. Any time I hear the Soft Cell version of Tainted Love, I always picture DeVito in the policeman uniform. “Did someone call for the looong arm of the law?” DeVito seems like a good sport for taking the part. FrancoBegbieJnrThe one where the neighbour Mr Heckles dies and Chandler sees a foreshadowing of his own lonely future. The realisation comes when Chandler hears the noisy girls upstairs and whacks the ceiling with Heckles’ broom, then looks at it and throws it aghast to the floor like it’s on fire. I love that bit it’s classic Matthew Perry physical comedy. He was brilliant. And it had the melancholy that American comedy does so well. The last scene of Chandler alone in the empty room, turning the light off, was very human, which is why we loved it. And you did … even if you pretended you didn’t. colin_robinsonThe one where Brad Pitt comes to Thanksgiving and tells everyone he started the I hate Rachel Green club in high school. Chandler breaks Monica’s special dinner plates and the day’s been so disastrous she says: “Oh my God, I’ve lost the will to scold.” NorthernsoulgirlFor me, the single funniest moment of the entire thing is Chandler’s crazy roommate’s goldfish cracker. Also, Ross – he’s undoubtedly a weirdo and a bit of a creep, which is what makes him the best character in the show. Chandler has the best quips, but in terms of plot-based humour, Ross has the best episodes hands down. I mean, holiday armadillo! diibiiI remember laughing so much the first time I watched The Baby on the Bus episode. And I like the episode where Phoebe and Mike (Paul Rudd) are donating and un-donating money to charity – and when they change their names to Princess Consuela Banana Hammock and Crap Bag. ID027179Best single shot? The bit where it looks like Joey is mournfully looking through a rain splattered window and missing Chandler, then the camera pulls back and he is actually looking through a piece of ‘art’ he bought in some post Chandler-moving-out shopping spree. It was pretty much always great. This and Frasier on a Friday night were a great start to the weekend. Good days. arcaneenchanterThe One Where No One’s Ready is my favourite.

You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07de465ff0e8520c45419baca16f64114ee955bc/0_283_2148_1288/master/2148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2d5cc11e3ce0b26a2471601b6695fb6","title":"french politicians pay tribute to former president chirac","story":"Emmanuel Macron says former president ‘protected France from hate’ and François Hollande hails him as a ‘fighter’Politicians from around the world have paid tribute to the former French president Jacques Chirac who has died at the age of 86.“President Jacques Chirac died this morning surrounded by his family, peacefully,” his son-in-law Frédéric Salat-Baroux announced. The road near his Paris home was protected by police in the afternoon, as the French parliament observed a minute’s silence.The country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, in a speech from the Elysée, paid tribute to Chirac, calling him “a great Frenchman”. He said Chirac was “a familiar face: whether we shared his ideas or not”. He said that he brought the country together.He that Chirac championed a “proud and independent France” on the world stage and “protected France from extremism and hate”.The Elysée Palace will be open to the public on Thursday evening so people can write in condolence books. There will be a day of national mourning on Monday.Richard Ferrand, the head of the lower house, said Chirac was larger than life and likened him to a literary character. “In Chirac, France has lost a hero from Alexandre Dumas: charmer, fighter and much deeper than he wanted to appear.”Ferrrand said: “The French people have lost an indefatigable republican, visionary, attentive to the great debates of his time ... Jacques Chirac is part of the history of France. A France in his image: spirited, complex, often full of contradictions, always driven by a tireless republican passion.”The French Green politician David Cormand said that what stood out about Chirac on the French right was that he “refused” any linking up with the far right, a critique of how later leaders on the centre-right increasingly courted far-right voters.The former socialist president François Hollande hailed Chirac as a “fighter” who “knew how to create a real link with the French people”.Paris’s socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said the city was “grieving”. The European commission president and former Luxembourg premier, Jean-Claude Juncker, was “moved and devastated” to learn of Chirac’s death, a spokeswoman said, adding that Europe was losing a “great statesman”.Twice elected head of state in 1995 and 2002, his 12 years in the Élysée Palace made him France’s second-longest-serving postwar president after his socialist predecessor François Mitterrand, with one of the longest political careers in Europe.Marine Le Pen, head of the far-right National Rally (formerly the Front National) and daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, paid tribute to Chirac for his stance on Iraq, saying he was “capable of opposing madness and the war in Iraq”.Tony Blair, who was infuriated with Chirac at the time of the Iraq war, hailed him on Thursday as “a towering figure in French and European politics over many decades”.Vladimir Putin heaped praise on Chirac as a “wise and far-sighted statesman” and also singled out “his intellect and huge knowledge”, the Kremlin said. Angela Merkel said he was “an outstanding partner and friend to us Germans”.During his lifetime Chirac was attacked by the French left for failing to address deep social isions, unemployment and debt, but was hailed for reconciling the nation with its history by acknowledging that France as a whole was responsible for the roundup of some 76,000 Jews sent to Nazi death camps during the second world war.Called a “weathervane” for shifting his political ideas so often, he was seen as a master of the art of electoral campaigning and hand shaking. He was an instinctive conservative but with an appeal that extended beyond the right. Chirac also served two stints as prime minister in 1974-76 and 1986-88 and was mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.It was his time at the helm of the French capital that resulted, once he had lost his presidential immunity, in a conviction for embezzlement and misuse of public funds. When he left office, he became the first former French president convicted of a crime – receiving a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of embezzling public funds as Paris mayor in order to illegally finance the rightwing party he led.Chirac had rarely been seen in public in recent years and was long known to have been suffering from ill health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9d96b131c9a53913f27f1e860db476208b6986/955_122_1648_989/master/1648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df2c2d03f0ab04b5215f949c9970082","title":"meps reject two eu commissioner candidates","story":"Candidates from Hungary and Romania are rejected in unprecedented move over alleged conflicts of interestThe European parliament has rejected EU commissioner candidates from Hungary and Romania over alleged conflicts of interest, in a blow to the incoming president, Ursula von der Leyen.The unprecedented move by MEPs ratchets up pressure on Von der Leyen, who must get her team of 26 EU commissioners approved next month if her new commission is to be ready for its launch day on 1 November.In a closed-door meeting, MEPs on the European parliament’s legal affairs committee rejected Romanian socialist Rovana Plumb and Hungarian Fidesz party appointee, László Trócsányi. Both were deemed to have a conflict of interest and denied permission to take part in hearings in front of the relevant European parliament committee, the next and essential step in becoming a European commissioner.The committee approved the remaining candidates, allowing 24 would-be commissioners to be questioned in a series of hearings due to begin on Monday.Von der Leyen and her team of 26 commissioners – one from each EU member state (excluding Brexit Britain) – can only take office after a vote by the European parliament scheduled for late October.While the parliament usually rejects one or two iniduals for a weak performance in the three-hour hearings, this is the first time it has rejected candidates before those public encounters. The show of strength is the result of a 2016 rule change to tighten scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest.Responding to the decision, Trócsányi said he had answered all the questions asked of him “in a transparent fashion” and warned of legal action. “In the case of the Hungarian commissioner-designate, a political decision was made lacking any factual basis, and I fully intend to take all necessary steps against it.”The former diplomat, appointed to Hungary’s dream job of commissioner for enlargement and relations with neighbouring countries, had already been warned he faced “a rough ride” from liberal MEPs over his record in constructing Viktor Orbán’s legal order.Plumb, nominated to lead EU transport policy, was reported by the Romanian press to have allegedly taken out loans that she later donated to the ruling party. She was rejected by 15 votes to six with two abstentions.Plumb told the Romanian media she had answered the legal affairs committee’s questions with “clarity and openness” and had not received any official decision from the parliament. She did not immediately respond to the ’s request for comment.In theory both candidates could still become EU commissioners if they satisfy the parliament they have no conflict of interest in their new roles. But their suspension could prompt their governments to nominate alternative candidates. Any new contenders would have very little time to prepare for the hearings, where they would face a barrage of questions from MEPs on their political vision and fine technical policy detail.Von der Leyen, who has said she wants to lead “a geopolitical commission”, was a surprise choice to lead the EU executive after EU leaders failed to agree on someone from a shortlist of politicians who had competed publicly for the job.The parliament’s assertive move could also raise tensions with governments in Hungary and Romania, who have clashed with Brussels over the rule of law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1002702cf170e6582ce2ad6aad025e68080f247/0_214_3738_2243/master/3738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b42a6350a616a542ca1f172c903e47","title":"racism in italian football a scourge of youth game too say campaigners","story":"Youth players targeted with racist insults similar to high-profile Serie A stars, study findsRacism blights youth football in Italy as much as it does the top leagues, with about 80 cases recorded over the last two seasons, campaigners have said.The issue has resurfaced after a string of incidents in Serie A in recent weeks, but scant attention has been given to what occurs in the lower rungs. Children as young as 12 are suffering racist abuse from adversaries and spectators, according to an independent organisation that collates data on racism incidents.“The attention on racism in football has only been noted when it happens in Serie A or B,” said Mauro Valeri, who leads the Observatory on Racism in Football. “However, there are many episodes in the youth teams, especially among very young players. The issue is not considered to be a serious problem. But in reality, if you look at the quantity – in the last two years alone I’ve registered about 80 episodes.”Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, urged the Italian football authorities to punish racists on Sunday after a Serie A match was briefly suspended following complaints from the Fiorentina player Dalbert that he was the target of racist chants and monkey noises from Atalanta fans.“You can’t have racism in society or in football,” Infantino said. “In Italy the situation hasn’t improved and this is serious.”Days earlier the Inter Milan coach, Antonio Conte, noted that racism in Italian football was getting “worse and worse” after Inter’s Romelu Lukaku was subjected to abuse during a match against Cagliari. A high-profile pundit was then sacked after using the word “banana” when describing Lukaku’s play.Valeri depends on local newspapers to track the prevalence of racism in youth football. In March, spectators yelled racist abuse at a 14-year-old goalkeeper, Eddie Gallinari, born in Italy to Ecuadorian-Italian parents, during a game between local sides in Savona, Liguria. The insults were heard by Gallinari’s mother, Ana Montoya Vera, as she watched her son’s team, Priamar, play Cairese.“It was very upsetting and it affected Eddie more at the time because he had just lost his grandad,” said Montoya Vera. “But he is mature and we spoke about it and challenged it. The problem of racism has grown and if it’s not dealt with adequately then the taunts could lead to something more serious, especially if it happens to a child who is not so strong.”The racists were never identified and while Cairese apologised, the club shirked responsibility for its fans.Gallinari’s case received more media coverage than usual following the intervention of Simone Valente, a parliamentarian with the Five Star Movement, who at the time was an under-secretary at the Ministry of Sport.“It’s important that the government condemns these acts immediately,” said Valente, who was born in Savona. “But essentially, confronting racism needs to start in schools. Almost every week you read about a case at youth level, but even if it only happens once a year it’s no different. Racism shouldn’t exist at all.”According to guidelines from the Italian football federation, a referee can abandon a match if two warnings, given over the PA system, fail to stop racist chants. Players found guilty of racism face disqualification. But racism is most prevalent among fans, who are more difficult to identify and punish. Cagliari escaped punishment over the alleged abuse of Lukaku because the stadium chants were inaudible.The issue is even more difficult to address in youth games as matches are played in stadiums that are not equipped with the technology to record the evidence. Valeri said racist abuse in the stands came from children and parents of rival players. He said it was not taken seriously as people denied they were being racist even when they used racist language.“Those in positions of responsibility just say that words don’t hurt,” said Valeri. “The problem is very deep … Italy has never regarded itself as a multi-ethnic country, and while other countries have seriously addressed racism in football, Italy never has.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7601afa768799b9839e9c06b3c427c0a2b68f336/29_146_2746_1647/master/2746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e11f9ceb7cd6db528c6ca1148bcbda47","title":"jacques chirac a life in pictures","story":"A look back at the life of Jacques Chirac, who had one of the longest continuous political careers in Europe"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister for Health to press ahead with plans for exclusion zones outside hospitalsThe \u0026euro20 million spent paying members for 15 minutes overtime to be briefed at start of shifts \u0026lsquogrieves some of us\u0026rsquo - Drew HarrisMental Health Commission also finds several shortcomings at children\u0026rsquos unit in GalwayTaoiseach also says there are no plans for a supplementary budget for BrexitGirl on camping holiday with parents was on her way from toilet when man (61) asked her to go into bushes with him\u0026lsquoThe reality is there are people who must be held accountable for what happened that night\u0026rsquoMinister for Sports Brendan Griffin says sports action plan will be presented to Government \u0026lsquoby the end of the year\u0026rsquoWRC found postings such as \u0026lsquorent allowance not\u0026rsquo breached the Equal Status ActsLabour court found Waterford Institute of Technology did not do enough to prevent harassment by male studentsDublin TD\u0026rsquos departure follows failure to resolve year-long dispute over party strategyGarda\u0026iacute still trying to confirm identities of the dead following Parteen crashCalf born in last fortnight is \u0026lsquofull of energy and very inquisitive\u0026rsquoDoherty says companies use data mining to implement \u0026lsquowidespread, extortionate\u0026rsquo dual pricing policyF\u0026oacutersa trade union criticise \u0026lsquobadge of honour\u0026rsquoculture of long working hoursExpanded Usher\u0026rsquos Island treatment centre will be opened by the end of 2021Some barristers are being \u0026lsquorewarded for failure\u0026rsquo by insurers. says Rossa FanningData Protection Commissioner stands over her report and is going ahead with enforcement proceedingsAdditional resources will mean \u0026lsquotemporary deficit\u0026rsquo where surplus otherwise expectedAgsi and GRA do not believe Drew Harris\u0026rsquos plans are based on any firm evidence"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4031487.1569516845!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paul murphy leaves socialist party to launch new group","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul Murphy is leaving  the Socialist party after it failed to resolve an internal year-long dispute over the extent and level of co-operation it should have with other left-leaning parties and movements of the left. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe The Dublin South West TD Paul Murphy is leaving the Socialist Party and will launch what he describes as a new socialist group next Monday.Mr Murphy, who has been a TD since 2014, is leaving after the party failed to resolve an internal year-long dispute over the extent and level of co-operation it should have with other left-leaning parties and movements of the left.Mr Murphy and a small group of his supporters had argued for deeper engagement with parties such as Sinn Féin and the Green Party, and with grassroots left-wing groups and movements such as Extinction Rebellion. A majority of party members opposed this approach.Another area of contention surrounded the level of engagement in civil campaigns such as Together for Yes. Mr Murphy, and the two remaining Socialist Party TDs, Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry, met The  as a group on Thursday. The three TDs said the parting was amicable and the two groups would continue to work together.“There was a genuine discussion on the struggle for socialism. We exhausted that process of debate,” Mr Murphy said. He said that rather than pulling the party apart it was better to recognise the reality of the differences that existed. And that meant two separate entities, but ones that would collaborate and cooperate. Mr Murphy’s new group will still be involved with the broader Solidarity-People Before Profit alliance but will no longer be part of Solidarity.Mr Murphy decided to leave the party ahead of its national convention last weekend. Unusually he did not attend the convention. “Our side of the party would have placed more emphasis on engaging in broader movements and participating in coalitions with others,” said Mr Murphy.No elected representative will leave the party with him. Among those who will join Mr Murphy’s group are former spokesman Dave Murphy, Diana O’Dwyer, and a number of trade union members and abortion rights activists.Difference of emphasisMr Barry said there was a difference of emphasis of engagement but he believed they had more to do with relations with existing political parties such as Sinn Féin than new grass roots movements. He said a “big majority of Socialist party members have chosen not to go with the new group”.The two groups disagreed over the extent of involvement of the Socialist Party in grass-roots movements such as Extinction Rebellion, the youth climate change strikes, new socialist groups in Britain and the US as well as civil society coalitions such as Together for Yes. Mr Murphy has argued in favour of more engagement with these groups and movements while his Socialist Party colleagues argued that the primary focus should be on building up the strength of the party. There were disagreements over the extent of the party’s role in Together for Yes, the broad umbrella group which campaigned to repeal abortion laws. While supporting it, and participating in its campaigning, the majority view, as set out by Ms Coppinger, was that the extent of its involvement should be limited.“Together for Yes was very conservative and very linked to the Government… It was in effect the Government campaign. (It was) not willing to advocate a pro-choice position which we believed was necessary.” Mr Barry said Mr Murphy had raised the issue that a significant number of workers and young people had voted Sinn Féin and they were an anti-establishment force.”“It’s something of a different issue (now) given the Sinn Féin tack to the right and the support for the market and coalitionism,” he said. “For us that’s problematic. We have members in the North of Ireland who are building cross-community socialist politics and building a base for fighting in the trade union movement,” he said. Ms Coppinger said the Socialist Party also viewed Sinn Féin as a sectarian party as “they can only represent one side of the ide” in the North. She said there was a huge appetite for working class politics in the North. “The reality is that Sinn Féin are part of the establishment of the North where they are implementing cuts and the austerity programme,” she said. Mr Murphy’s group also looked more favourably at the influence of Momentum in the Labour Party in Britain and looked at the possibilities for such movements in Ireland. Ms Coppinger said they all supported Jeremy Corbyn and his attempt to have a left programme for the Labour Party. The difficulty, she argued, was Mr Corbyn was “imprisoned by the Blairites.“He is trying to tack between the right and the left,” she said.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Number of criminals brought to trial hits record low amid warning justice system is \u0026#39grinding to halt\u0026#39Sir John Major fears Boris Johnson’s Government could use Privy Council to bypass Brexit extension legislationMore than half of young people are going to university for the first time, figures revealBanker\u0026#39s wife who spent £16m in Harrods escapes extradition to Azerbaijan on embezzlement chargesDying former soldier given guard of honour as he pleads not guilty to killing Northern Irish man during the TroublesCatherine the Great, Sky Atlantic, first look review: Helen Mirren dazzles in a lush, lusty costume dramaRobert Mugabe to be buried in home village as Zimbabwe government abandons mausoleum plansComment: It is misery to be a night owl on a schedule set by larksComment: Jeremy Corbyn is a busted flush, and his humiliated party is all too aware of itComment: After those shocking scenes on Wednesday, the mood in the Commons has turned utterly rancidComment: Far from being unprecedented, British politics has always been a raucous bear pit\tBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson says MPs will not be \u0026#39bullied\u0026#39 into curtailing their languageDonald Trump impeachment inquiry: Intelligence chief testifies to Congress about Ukraine scandalChina unveils 500 megapixel camera that can identify every face in a crowd of tens of thosandsComment: Blocking or even delaying Brexit threatens to destroy conservatism as we know it\tBreakthrough in fight against antimicroboial resistance as scientists discover how bacteria is \u0026#39hiding\u0026#39 from drugsGovernment barrister who took \u0026#39upskirt\u0026#39 photo of woman on the tube caught by off-duty police officer, court hearsRoman fort discovered by workmen building new bus station in ExeterRRS David Attenborough: William and Kate bow to broadcasting royalty at launch of \u0026#39Boaty McBoatface\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/04/15/17/ABN-amro.jpg","title":"abn amro money laundering investigation danske bank latest","story":"Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsProbe announced just a day after\u0026nbspthe former head of Danske Bank in Estonia, the unit at the centre of a €200bn\u0026nbspdirty money scandal, was found deadEurope’s widening money laundering scandals took a new turn on Thursday as Dutch lender ABN Amro Bank\u0026nbspdisclosed a criminal probe over alleged failures to check on clients and report suspicious transactions.Shares of the bank slumped to its lowest\u0026nbspin more than three years and its bonds fell as investors assessed the financial impact on a lender that’s still trying to exit government ownership after a bailout.

On Tuesday, Germany’s Deutsche Bank received a visit from law enforcement officials over its role in the scandal.ABN Amro is under investigation for failing to report suspicious transactions and not conducting sufficient checks on its clients, the Dutch prosecutor’s office said on Thursday. The bank said separately that it faces an investigation under the Dutch anti-money laundering and terrorist-financing law, without providing further detail.Created with Sketch.Biggest business scandals in pictures  Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.VW admitted to rigging its US emission tests so that diesel-powered cars would looks like they were emitting less nitrous oxide, which can damage the ozone layer and contribute to respiratory diseases.

The Dutch bank’s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.“There’s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,” said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. “The big question is whether there’s actual money laundering involved in this case. That’s what the prosecutor’s investigation probably is trying to find out.”The Dutch bank said in July said that it needs to review all of its 5 million retail clients after receiving a warning from the Dutch central bank. ABN Amro took a €114m\u0026nbspprovision for the checks in the second quarter, after already setting aside 85 million euros at the end of last year for stepping up financial crime prevention in commercial banking and the credit card business.Ex-CEO of bank unit at heart of money-laundering scandal found deadThe bank said at the time that sanctions may be imposed by the authorities but said it hasn’t made a provision for a possible fine as the “amount cannot be estimated at this time”.The investigation and the resulting share price drop may make it harder for the Dutch government – which still owns 56 per cent\u0026nbspafter a bailout in 2009 – to sell off the rest of its stake as it pledged to do during the bank’s IPO in 2015. Meanwhile, the bank is still looking for a new chief executive officer after Kees van Dijkhuizen announced in June that he will leave when his term ends in April.Following the ING fine and the central bank’s criticism, the largest Dutch banks have been stepping up compliance spending, including adding more staff to its crime prevention teams. Earlier this month, five of the country’s largest lenders said they are exploring a system to jointly monitor transactions in the fight against money laundering after the government pledged to clear legal hurdles that might prevent them from doing so.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.The legal documents say that, by contrast, Ms Morales runs a “small business” with just a “handful of employees”, a small online presence and poorly subscribed social media accounts.“The Opposition, which claims that consumers are likely to be confused between a boutique wedding event planning business and Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world, is frivolous and should be refused in its entirety,” the court documents add.Beyonce recently collaborated with her daughter on her Lion King soundtrack album The Gift, which made Blue Ivy the youngest female artist in history to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\u0026nbspBlue Ivy frequently appears with her parents at prestigious events, including the 2019 Grammy Awards and the world premiere of The Lion King.\u0026nbspBeyonce and Jay-Z are also parents to two-year-old twins Rumi and Sir Carter.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Dutch bank’s Additional Tier 1 bonds fell the most in six months following news of the probe.“There’s so much uncertainty for the shareholders now,” said KBW analyst Jean-Pierre Lambert by phone. “The big question is whether there’s actual money laundering involved in this case.

For one, sudden delays at the border would damage the vital “just-in-time” supply chains across the English Channel, costing it as much as £50,000 a minute.JLR joins Toyota and BMW who have both announced temporary plant closures after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspToyota will stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derbyshire on 1 November.BMW is planning to shut down its Oxford site on 31 October and 1 November.

But overseas immigration, already lower than to England, has dropped sharply in recent years.“Now that net migration is falling and we face the coming challenge of Brexit, we find ourselves once again facing a major demographic challenge,” the authors write.By 2041, Scotland’s pensionable-age population is projected to increase by 265,000, while the working-age population is seen rising only by 38,000, according to National Records of Scotland. Net migration from overseas, or inflows minus outflows, is forecast to decline substantially in the next few years.The report says part of the solution will come from future technological change and from encouraging more people of working age to enter the labour market.“But even together these will not be enough to cover expected shortages. Immigration must, therefore, be a priority,” it notes.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

One example is the shops, hotels and restaurants sector. Another is what is known as the caring, leisure and other services industry.“Given the ageing population, the health and social care sector is likely to be particularly affected by labour shortages,” the authors write.In turn, the ageing of Scotland’s population will be partly determined by immigration, since foreign nationals living in the country are on average considerably younger than the domestic population.Given Scotland’s peculiarities, including a lower birth rate than in all other parts of the UK, it needs an immigration policy tailored to its needs, the report argues.The report\u0026nbspgoes on to examine the example of Canada where inidual provinces design the immigration policy together with the federal government, taking into account their distinct needs.“Evidence suggests this approach has mitigated depopulation in some provinces and has had a significant economic benefit,” the paper says.The authors stress they do not suggest importing Canada’s immigration model wholesale but, rather, using it as a starting point for designing a system for the UK and Scotland.“The biggest challenge to implementing such a system in the UK would be the tradition of centralised decision-making in this area, as well as the lack of a political consensus over the benefits of immigration,” they write.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That site had a rather obvious picture at the top: a photo of a hairy hand on top of what appears to be skin, with large letter saying “BackRub” placed on top of it.It became Google in late 1997. The look was a little reminiscent of Word Art of old: the 3D letters tipped back, with strange pixelated edges.Created with Sketch.Here\u0027s how the Google logo has evolved  Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This was Google\u0027s first ever logo, used from September to October 1998 Google went with an exclamation point from  October 1998 to May 1999 This newer logo lasted for 10 years and 11 months,  from May 31, 1999 to May 5, 2010This Google logo was used from May 6, 2010 to September 18, 2013The Google logo used from September 19, 2013 to September 1, 201566 The new additionThe newest Google Logo launched on the 1st of September 2015 This was Google\u0027s first ever logo, used from September to October 1998 Google went with an exclamation point from  October 1998 to May 1999 This newer logo lasted for 10 years and 11 months,  from May 31, 1999 to May 5, 2010This Google logo was used from May 6, 2010 to September 18, 2013The Google logo used from September 19, 2013 to September 1, 201566 The new additionThe newest Google Logo launched on the 1st of September 2015 At that time, the site was just as youthful. It was still functioning largely as a search engine for Stanford University, as well as the web, and offered an explanation of what it was at the top with a little text box underneath.The logo then got slightly more grown-up. It got a little flattened down –\u0026nbspthe 3D letters becoming curvy rather than looking like real objects – and the colours changed.Google also briefly got an exclamation mark in 1999. It disappeared a year later.That shouting logo would be the last very different one that the site would have. Until today’s redesign, the site stuck by its formula: two blue letters, two red and one yellow and one green, all in an entirely unobjectionable serif font.The company would gradually change that look, moving letters around, softening the colours and getting rid of shadow, but the concept remained the same until 2015.Most recently, it dropped the serifs that made the letters distinctive but harder to read on the tiny screens of mobiles. In doing so, it recognised one of the most important changes during its 21 years –\u0026nbsplike Google itself, the logo had been designed to be looked at on screens, but now a huge proportion of web browsing is done from phones and other mobile devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For one, sudden delays at the border would damage the vital “just-in-time” supply chains across the English Channel, costing it as much as £50,000 a minute.JLR joins Toyota and BMW who have both announced temporary plant closures after the Brexit date.\u0026nbspToyota will stop production at its Burnaston factory in Derbyshire on 1 November.BMW is planning to shut down its Oxford site on 31 October and 1 November. If Britain leaves the EU without a deal and there is major disruption to BMW’s operations, the carmaker will send its Oxford workers on unpaid leave for at least two weeks.Anticipation of Brexit has compounded the problems facing UK carmakers.

As it did, it sent out an alert to international astronomers, so that they could track it themselves.Nasa plans to send ‘shapeshifter’ robots to alien worldsHoloien\u0026nbspreceived that alert and pointed two telescopes towards the incident and asked for more to look that way too.Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspTESS was already looking towards the right part of space. It spends its time watching vast parts of the sky known as sectors for 27 days each, with the aim of spotting moments where stars go dark that could indicate a planet has passed in front of them.Astronomers thought it might also be able to catch the earliest moments of flare-ups around stars, such as\u0026nbspsupernovae and tidal disruptions. And it did see this one: first spotting a week before\u0026nbspASAS-SN\u0026nbspsaw it, but unable to tell Earth straight away because it sends back its data once every two weeks, and that must then be processed by Nasa.Researchers could then look back at that data and see the star as it was being torn up by the black hole.“The early TESS data allow us to see light very close to the black hole, much closer than we’ve been able to see before,” said Patrick Vallely, a co-author and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at OSU.“They also show us that ASASSN-19bt’s rise in brightness was very smooth, which helps us tell that the event was a tidal disruption and not another type of outburst, like from the center of a galaxy or a supernova.”Much about tidal disruptions is still mysterious to astronomers, but observations of this kind could shed more light on why they happen. They are unclear about why they throw out so much UV emissions but so few X-rays, for instance.“People have suggested multiple theories — perhaps the light bounces through the newly created debris and loses energy, or maybe the disk forms further from the black hole than we originally thought and the light isn’t so affected by the object’s extreme gravity,” said S. Bradley\u0026nbspCenko, Swift’s principal investigator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspin Greenbelt, Maryland. “More early-time observations of these events may help us answer some of these lingering questions.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But overseas immigration, already lower than to England, has dropped sharply in recent years.“Now that net migration is falling and we face the coming challenge of Brexit, we find ourselves once again facing a major demographic challenge,” the authors write.By 2041, Scotland’s pensionable-age population is projected to increase by 265,000, while the working-age population is seen rising only by 38,000, according to National Records of Scotland. Net migration from overseas, or inflows minus outflows, is forecast to decline substantially in the next few years.The report says part of the solution will come from future technological change and from encouraging more people of working age to enter the labour market.“But even together these will not be enough to cover expected shortages. Immigration must, therefore, be a priority,” it notes.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

One example is the shops, hotels and restaurants sector. Another is what is known as the caring, leisure and other services industry.“Given the ageing population, the health and social care sector is likely to be particularly affected by labour shortages,” the authors write.In turn, the ageing of Scotland’s population will be partly determined by immigration, since foreign nationals living in the country are on average considerably younger than the domestic population.Given Scotland’s peculiarities, including a lower birth rate than in all other parts of the UK, it needs an immigration policy tailored to its needs, the report argues.The report\u0026nbspgoes on to examine the example of Canada where inidual provinces design the immigration policy together with the federal government, taking into account their distinct needs.“Evidence suggests this approach has mitigated depopulation in some provinces and has had a significant economic benefit,” the paper says.The authors stress they do not suggest importing Canada’s immigration model wholesale but, rather, using it as a starting point for designing a system for the UK and Scotland.“The biggest challenge to implementing such a system in the UK would be the tradition of centralised decision-making in this area, as well as the lack of a political consensus over the benefits of immigration,” they write.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there is expectation that they will resume again in the future, with the US president desperate to get US forces back home before the election next year, allowing him to claim credit for ending the longest war in America’s history.Many of the candidates in the coming Afghan election, including some who would not have countenanced this happening in the past, now say that the push for Taliban involvement in government is going to get stronger over the coming months and maybe difficult to resist.\u0026nbspThis is likely, they say, not just because of the signals from Washington, but the violent reality on the ground, with the Talibs and other Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and Isis controlling expanding swathes of territory and war weariness from a population suffering relentless bombings and shootings.\u0026nbspThe star attraction at the Bamiyan rally was Abdullah Abdullah, who had been the co-leader of the current National Unity Government with President Ashraf Ghani and who is now his main rival at the polls.Bamiyan via helicopter (Getty Images)As we flew up to Bamiyan together from Kabul on an army helicopter, Dr Abdullah, who had the title of Chief Executive in the administration, spoke of the need to find a way to end the bloody conflict, and how power sharing with the Taliban could be the answer.“The Taliban are a reality in the country, their forces, their supporters, their foreign connections. Everybody agrees you cannot finish this war by just fighting and killing everybody. Hopefully the Taliban see it as well,” he said.“The point is to move to a solution and one I would like to have is an interim set-up. All sorts of possibilities have to be looked at, including power sharing. Then there is a permanent solution, and that will be through elections.“I think the US have done a good job, but before agreeing to a (draft) agreement they should have imposed some conditions on the Taliban. There should have been an agreement on a ceasefire. Look at how committed the people are to the election despite how dangerous it is. We cannot let down these people so we must find a solution.”Dr Abdullah was once a key lieutenant of Ahmed Shah Masood, the Northern Alliance Commander, ‘The Lion of Panjshir’ and fought alongside him in the years of bloody conflict with the Taliban.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I want for the powerful people around the world to stop the war and bring peace, because I don\u0027t want other children to lose their fathers.”Andrew QuiltySave the Children“I want to become a teacher to serve the country and I don\u0027t want any girls to be illiterate. I want to teach all the girls, so they have access to education.”Andrew QuiltySave the ChildrenBut now he feels that the Doha talks laid the groundwork for a settlement: “I wouldn’t call it the most ideal agreement, but then we are not in the most ideal situation. The Americans are concerned - they think they can get troop levels down to zero and so there is urgency to all this, and we need to take this seriously.”There are many among the people of Bamiyan who will view the Taliban regaining authority with great trepidation. The Hazara Shias of the region were the victims of a number of massacres and mass rapes at the hands of the Pashtun Sunni Islamists during the savage civil war.Bamiyan province has experienced clashes between the two ethnic groups since the fall of the Taliban. Its wondrous landscape of mountains, gorges and valleys, deep green fields and turquoise lakes - and fascinating architecture from its time as a conduit of the Silk Road - have largely escaped the strife of recent years.There has been investment in infrastructure and education and promotion of female rights. Four years after the Taliban were whipping women for not wearing the burqa, Habiba Sarobi in Bamiyan became Afghanistan’s first female Governor in 2005.Abdulla (Getty Images)But the region has become more isolated. The roads to Kabul in the south east are now dangerous, as are the roads to Kunsuz and Mazar-e-Sharif in the north. In the autumn of last year, the Taliban fighters began targeting Hazara residents in the central provinces of Uruzgan and Ghazni. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands displaced in the fighting which followed.Residents of Bamiyan, like those in other parts of the country, have received messages from the Taliban to keep away from election rallies during the campaign and polling stations on voting days. But a group of young students waiting to hear Dr Abdullah and the fellow speakers in his coalition, Karim Khalili and Mohammed Mohaqeq, wanted to point out that they had no intention of being put off by the threats. They had come to confirm they were making the right decision when they vote in Saturday’s presidential election.“It’s the first one that I have been able to vote in because of my age and I don’t want to make a mistake”, said Parwan Nazari, who is studying at Bamiyan University. “I think I’ll vote for Dr Abdullah, but I wanted to listen to him and also the others, this is a good opportunity. I will certainly be voting and so will all my friends, our families are very encouraging about this.”Ms Nazari and her friend, Nisa Ghaznavi, both 19, are reading English literature and both want to be journalists. “I want to find out for myself what is going on rather than just depending on social media. I want to travel as well and see other places. I want to look at the future,” said Ms Ghaznavi. Banen Haidari is also looking to the future, but is also deeply interested in aspects of the past. She is studying geology and architecture and one of the key reasons for her doing so was “that”, she said, pointing at the rock niches where one of Buddhas had once stood.Haji Abdullah speak (Aleem AghaThe Independent)They are now covered in scaffolding for buttresses. “But we are hoping that work will start, and I want to be part of a team which works on rebuilding them. I have always been interested, since I was little.”\u0026nbspAll the women in the group wanted the statues to be rebuilt, some not just to restore heritage, but in the hope that it will bring in tourists. “We need the money, and it’s always good to see foreign people”, said Ms Ghaznavi.The women in the group were too young to have experienced Taliban atrocities firsthand, although they had heard about them from their parents. None of them, however, objected to the Taliban forming part of a future government - “people are just tired of war,” Ms Nazari said.\u0026nbspBut the friends agreed with Fatima Alizada, who warned caution. “We need to make sure that the Taliban don’t impose their old rules, that they respect the reforms which have been carried out”.Ms Alizada, 19, who is doing a course in Islamic Studies and who wants to be a defence lawyer, does not think the emancipation of women has gone far enough in Afghanistan. “Why haven’t we got one single woman running for the presidency?” she wanted to know.\u0026nbspSitting in the shade of a wall, Haji Abdullah could think of no good memories of the Taliban times. “All I can recall are tortures and beatings, people being jailed, men forced not to cut their beards, so no, that was a bad time,” he said.\u0026nbspUstad Abdul Karim Khalili during the final campaign rally in Bamiyan (Getty Images)“I remember when they blew up the Buddha. They had these big guns, they were firing from a long way away. I could see the statues getting hit, 18, 19 times, they just kept on firing at them. What they did was very bad.”Haji Abdullah was ambivalent about the Taliban returning. “We want peace yes, but they must accept the laws and not interfere with our lives.” The\u0026nbsp36-year-old shopkeeper\u0026nbspwas doing alright, and not hard-up financially, despite having six children. He would vote for Dr Abdullah, but also wanted to say Ashraf Ghani was “a good man.”Ahmed Ali Wahdat, the owner of a carpentry business, was more forthright. “You cannot trust the Taliban. We know what they did last time, all the killings that took place, homes burnt.“They wanted to destroy. They used cannons and dynamite on the Buddhas, but even then it took them weeks you know, those statues were so strong.\u0026nbspAnd now they can be rebuilt again, so they won’t stay destroyed. It’s the way us Hazaras have had to be strong to survive, the way Afghanistan has had to survive. Why give all that up, bringing back the people who did this?”Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’ and the third part here:\u0026nbspRaid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

services were first called to the family home in the town of Osgood on May  to attend to Desiree, who was unresponsive.Stephen Ritz, who was engaged to Desirees mother Christina McCartney at the time, had asked Kedrowitz to watch Desiree while he left the room to check on other children in the house.When he ed, Kedrowitz told him the infant had stopped breathing.McCartney was just arriving home from work and performed CPR until an ambulance arrived.Desiree was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead on May , with an autopsy the following day failing to establish a cause of death.On July , less than two months later, McCartney asked Kedrowitz to take Nathaniel to bed, but moments later he told her that something is not quite right and that the baby aint moving, according to court documents.Nathaniels initial autopsy was similarly inconclusive.Around a month and a half after Nathaniels death, McCartney called Indiana state police to inform them that Kedrowitz had mutilated a kitten to the point of almost killing it at his aunt and uncles home because it had scratched him.His aunt and uncle had decided to take the kitten somewhere to kill it because it was suffering, and Kedrowitz askedcould go with them to see the kittens brains splatter everywhere, court documents said.Kedrowitzs aunt, Candice Barker, later told police that Kedrowitz had been failing classes and fighting at school and that he often didnt tell the truth, was self-centred, and had been on anti-depressant medication.In the weeks that followed, Kedrowitz, McCartney, and Ritz all underwent psychological evaluations.Psychologist Dr. Linda McIntire later told police she believed it was possible that Kedrowitz had killed Desiree and Nathaniel.When questioned by police, Kedrowitz made multiple statements about freeing his siblings from Satan and Hell and invoked violent themes involving large knives and burning fire, court documents said.Asked directlyhe has caused his siblings death, Kedrowitz did not respond.Two days later, he said he had had a conversation with God about the two infants, and told police he didnt want them to live in the hell that he lived in.He later confessed to having put a blank over Nathaniels head and a towel over Desirees, court documents said.In January , amended autopsy results were released giving both Nathaniel and Desirees cause of

But what happened and why did he quit Davis, , was born in York to a single mother and was initially brought up by his grandparents.When his mother remarried the family moved to South London, living in a deprived part of Wandsworth before moving to a council estate in Tooting.He completed a BSc in computer science at Warwick University before studying at London Business School and Hard.Aged , he was first elected to parliament in  as MP for Boothferry - which later became his current constituency Haltemprice and Howden.In , he was a government whip who worked on pushing through the Maastricht treaty, which led to the euro and greater integration of the European Union.He twice stood for Conservative party leader in  and  but was beaten to the post by Iain Duncan Smith then David Cameron.Davis triggered a by-election in  following a row over civil liberties after new terror laws were passed allowing suspects to be detained without charge for  days.Despite getting re-elected he was sidelined for nearly a decade on the backbenches before ing to the cabinet in  after Theresa May took office.Davis married Doreen Davis in , and they live together in a farmhouse in rural Yorkshire.They have three grown-up children and five grandchildren.Davis previously played down the chances of a leadership challenge during Brexit negotiations, praising a very good Prime Minister.But since he quit as Brexit secretary he seems to be carving his own path as a future leader with a distinct vision of how to leave the EU.Davis today fired the starting gun on the race to succeed Theresa May - hinting he will run to be PM.The ex-Brexit Secretary suggested he is the best candidate to lead the country as he declared himself the last of the great romantic radicals.Mr Davis is the first candidate to publicly express an interest in taking over since Mrs May announced shell quit in time for the next election.He has previously run for the Tory leadership twice - losing to Iain Duncan Smith in  and David Cameron in .In an interview in the April issue of Tatler, Mr Davis said he has the right qualications to take over from Mrs May.He said: If this were an application for a job as a chief executive, I would probably win it. But it isn’t. And that isn’t the way the decision is done.Mr Davis added that he was the PMs favourite minister before he resigned over Brexit last year.David Davis announced his resignation minutes before midnight on July , , with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposals would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.He said there had been a signicant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number  policy line.He added that he had previously decided to toe the line and remain in the Cabinet because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.But in a damning verdict on the PMs approach, he wrote: I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.In her reply, Mrs May told him: I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed on at Cabinet on Friday.She said: I am sorry that you have chosen to leave the Government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful Brexit and when we are only eight months from the date set in law when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.Davis was a high-profile Leave supporter and campaigner in the run-up to the EU referendum.He was asked to rejoin the cabinet as Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.Downing Street sources say he won the trust of Mrs May and was seen as a safer pair of hands than other outspoken Leavers such as Boris Johnson and Liam Fox.He appears to have taken care not to talk out of line or become embroiled in public rows with colleagues over how Brexit will unfold.Laying out his Brexit plans, Mr Davis claimed the economy would feel the benefits even before Britains departure because of increased foreign investment.He said: Brexit will deliver the circumstances that allow us to pursue an unfettered high growth strategy.Mr Davis has urged business chiefs to stay with Britain following fears some companies may be tempted to move staff or manufacturing to other European countries."},{"url":null,"title":"halloween 2019 date celebrate uk","story":"We delve into the history and how you can celebrate this October.Halloween falls every year on October , which is a Thursday this year.It is also Brexit day, the day the UK leaves the EU.It is held the day before All Saints’ Day, which is a Christian festival used to celebrate recognised saints.Halloween activities typically involve trick or treating, dressing up in fancy dress and carving pumpkins.The word Halloween comes from Hallowe’en, meaning “hallowed evening” or holy evening.The word Halloween itself is a Scottish term for All Hallows Eve - which means its the evening before All Saints Day.It is widely thought that Halloween traditions came from Celtic harvest festivals of Samhain, although some people support the view that Halloween began independently as a Christian festival.Samhain was a celebration of the end of the harvest season, and means summer’s end.People at this time thought the walls between worlds were thin and ghosts could pass through into our realm, and it was feared they may damage crops for the next season.To appease any spirits, Gaels would set up places at their dinner tables for the spirits and light bonfires to scare off evil spirits.There are a number of ways to celebrate the festival, whether you want to go out or enjoy it from the comfort of your home.These include:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance.

commentator Mark Lawson has pointed out the show, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, has become outlandish and ­unsustainable on account of the ludicrous number of rape victims and murderers.And that’s before you even start trying to calculate the number of Walford characters who’ve been abducted.Personally, though, I don’t ­remember a time when EastEnders was anything other than the most deranged show on television.I would’ve thought more obvious signs it had lost the plot would be Ben Mitchell’s six ­dferent heads, Phil Mitchell’s ­people smuggling operation with Barry Grant off Brookside and the surprisingly high number of ­characters who revealed they were gay in time for the opening of the show’s new LGBT bar.Which has to be the happiest ­EastEnders coincidence since The Queen Vic organised a “European night,” not long after the Brexit vote.It’s good to have your prejudices ­questioned, though, so I watched with added care last week to seeI’d been missing a trick, as the Square came to terms with the bloody aftermath of the pub siege.Hunter’s still dead, thankfully, but Keanu’s made a remarkable recovery from being shot at point blank range and Bex is up for something called a “Pride of Walford award.” The real focus of the drama, however, was Bobby Beale, who’s freshly released from prison and so traumatised he’s prone to taking drugs and wandering off into train tunnels.As would youyou’d killed your sister and undergone four head transplants.The cure for all this ­torment is classic EastEnders and actually a bit easier to believe than the idea Ian Beale’s new lodger is Rainie, the ­prostitute he had sex with the night daughter Lucy was killed.Bobby’s embraced Islam.He says: “It helps me see the good in people.”The show says it is “to counter negative representations of Islam.”No word on why these representations might be negative, of course, just as EastEnders never had any dramatic response or even a mention of ­Islamist terror attacks in London or three East End schoolgirls running away to join IS.Bobby’s story exists in a soap vacuum.It’s a no-context approach that treats the viewers as dangerous idiots, of course, but wouldn’t grate quite so much­EastEnders had a blanket approach to all religions.It doesn’t, though. Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save. One is James Cracknell, whose tango had more than a touch of the Boris Karloffs about it.The other is BBC reporter Mike Bushell, who did a sailor’s hornpipe to The Contours with double nork-grab to finish, accompanied by the insatiable Katya Jones, who sounds like she still won’t take no for an answer.“Even when I was in bed, next to my we,” complained Mike, “Katya’s saying, ‘Give me five, give me five, give me five’.”Mike.

He repeatedly used the language of surrender about his opponents, showed no regard for the memory of murdered MP Jo Cox, and said it was “humbug” when an MP talked about the death threats she had received. I had massive disagreements with David Cameron, but this represented a new low. His behaviour is no accident, it is a deliberate strategy. He thinks by stirring up hatred and ision, he can blame everyone  for the mess the country is in and wash his hands of responsibility. He wants to pretend that we can crash out with No Deal on st October without consequences for you and your family - and that anyone standing in his way is treasonous.    People share a massive frustration that over three years on from the Brexit vote, we are still stuck as a country. But we can and must find a way forward without descending into hatred and vitriol and we must get back as a country to all the issues that matter so much, like the NHS, schools, jobs and housing. The vast majority of us share values of tolerance, respect and decency. Before  that is what we used to be known for around the world.

She instead called Greggsapos customer service and was offered a £ voucher, but says she turned it down.    Sharleen said: I was asking for a public apology to make people aware that they should watch out for things like this.

The -year-old also threatened his lover with a kne and told her he was going to drive his van into a reservoir and drown her. Carr is now serving  years and three months in prison after he was sent down last week. Now Ms Marchant has spoken about the harrowing experience at the hands of her cruel and violent ex and how convinced she was she was going to die.    She has spoken out about her ordeal in the hope that others will seek helpthey are in abusive relationships. Ms Marchant told of how intense the emotional fallout of the attack has been, with the young woman avoiding dressing gowns for fear of hanging, taking down the registration when she sees the car model he drove and physically reacting to his smell.When Iaposm out,I smell the aftershave he was wearing, I just have to get out of that area, she told Sky News. The brutal attack on the morning of May ,  came as a shock to Ms Marchant. Since the couple had met in a bar in June last year and began dating in October things between them had seemed good. At first he was charming and kind, regularly buying her flowers. There were none of the classic warning signs that the relationship was an unhealthy one, Ms Marchant said, with Carr not showing any controlling behaviour like telling his partner what to wear. This all changed when the brutal boyfriend boasted that he had been cheating on her. When Ms Marchant asked to go home, he took her phone and the keys to her car, locking her in his house.  It was at this point that the savage attack began. The Castleford, West Yorkshire man covered her face with a pillowcase and pushed her from room to room, choking her neck. As Ms Marchant pleaded I donapost want to die, Carr threatened to hurt her son while brandishing a kne and then shoving her head through a noose. She said: As Stefan tied the white noose around my neck, I thought I was going to die. He told me that he was a trained killer and he didnapost want to be aposthatapos person, but I was making him that person. After three minutes of hanging from the knot, fearing her two-year-old would never see his mum again, the terried woman tumbled onto the floor. The moment she was released from the deadly knot she vomitted. The ordeal only ended when Ms Marchant convinced Carr to take her to hospital, promising not to tell anyone about the attack. While he was roughly shoving her into the back of his van the neighbours looked out onto the street, having heard Ms Marchantaposs screams. They had already called the police, but phoned again when they saw her being manhandled.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMum-of-four Dayna Martin doesnapost believe in conventional parenting methods and instead allows her children to choose everything about how they live their lives. From their bedtimes, to what food they eat and eventhey want to go to school, Daynaaposs four children choose everything for themselves. The -year-old says she found mainstream education controlling when she was young and is now an unschooling advocate, which means children only learn when they want to. But Dayna insists her brood - Devin, , Tfany, , Ivy,  and Orion,  - are all budding entrepreneurs who are caring and love learning. Each of her offspring decides what time to get up every day before choosing how they want to fill their time.    They also get to pick exactly what they want to eat - although all of them have chosen to be vegan. The youngsters get to determine how long they want to spend on a computer every day. Dayna, of New Hampshire, USA, who does not believe in punishing her children, said: If they misbehave, I just ask them, aposWhat can I do to help apos It makes them think. “My children have never been to school, and don’t do any formal schoolwork or any exams – and that is completely their choice. “They also don’t have a set bedtime and there are no limits on their technology use or what food they eat. “People think my approach may be hands-off, or even neglectful. I’ve even been told my children won’t do anything in le – but none of that is the case. “My philosophy isn’t anti-school – it’s anti-force. So much parenting advice out there focuses on punishment, compliance and rules, but I want my children to be free to make their own decisions.  “Controlling them would lead to them developing warped relationships with the things I’m trying to restrict – and then it just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. By working with other parents, I see the most proof of this in computer use and food. Control causes a child to want nothing but freedom, because they donapost have the opportunity to self-regulate and find balance. Dayna is no longer with the father of her children but is now in a long distance relationship with UK-based, Le, who is a fellow child advocate. She insists she isnapost neglecting her children and instead is encouraging them to make decisions and think for themselves. Dayna went to mainstream school and did well but says she disliked the rules and regulations. She explained: Things like raising my hand and having to ask permission to go to the bathroom made no sense to me.  “I felt asteachers always assumed negative intent with my classmates and I, like we were bound to be up to no good.” Dayna claims her experience at school led to her feeling misunderstood and when she had her first child, Devin, in  started to look into alternative ways of educating him. She said: I was in my hospital room, holding Devin, and watching TV. The Columbine High School shooting was happening that day, literally being played out live on the news. I remember thinking about how many families would have wanted to be together that day. In that moment, I decided to give my children a choice - to leave it up to them whether they’d like to go to mainstream school or not. It wasn’t a fear-based decision – I’m not sayingthey went to school, they’d have been caught up in a shooting. I just wanted to make sure they had that freedom of choice. Dayna begant to practise attachment parenting, which is based on physical closeness between mum and baby through things like bed-sharing and breastfeeding so the infant feels safe. She said: It wasn’t a conscious decision to do attachment parenting, though. I was just doing what felt instinctive.    By the time Devin was seven months old, Dayna had researched how she wanted to educate him and decided he would be schooled at home. She said: Neither of us liked the idea of being forcibly separated, so homeschooling made sense. All four of her children have now been aposunschooledapos and this means they decide what best suits them, along with what and how they learn.   Dayna uses a mixture of textbooks and internet resources to help but also takes a lot of inspiration from going out into the world and learning hands-on how things work. She said: “It’s all based around what they are interested in, and they have taught themselves so many skills. “Devin is a self-taught blacksmith. He really loves science, too, whereas Tfany is very into music. Ivy runs a small animal rescue centre and is hugely into animal rights. Not going to school means she has the time to go and do things like that. “Orion loves hiking, as well as computers and gaming. I see their interests as an extension of their learning.    While school places much more emphasis on certain topics, I wouldn’t want to tell them any of their hobbies aren’t as important as others. Even learning the basic skills is unusual in Daynaaposs house.  She explained: The way children learn to read and write naturally looks very dferent to when they do it in school. School is all about set targets, and having to be at a certain level by a set age – when actually, I believe there is a huge window when you can learn. Homeschooled children can learn to read anywhere from the age of three to . My kids learned by immersing themselves in the written word. I see their interests as the nucleus to their learning and get all the educational resources I can around that. For example,they say they’re interested in astronomy, I’ll get books and other resources to encourage them. Humans want to learn – and basing it all around something they are actively interested in helps incentivise them. With no structured lessons, Dayna’s children are not required to complete assignments or sit formal exams.    Only Devin has even sat an exam when he decided he wanted to pass his high school diploma. He was supervised by a local charter school – a publicly-funded school which runs independently of the mainstream education system. Despite critics’ warnings that the childrenaposs unschooling means they would not amount to anything in le, he passed with flying colours. Dayna said: For lots of people who have been following my journey, that was the proof that unschooling works. “Devin scored above average in most of his tests. He’s learned as much –not more – being at home than pupils who have been forced to sit in a brick building for hours every day. “I am compassionate to schools and understand that they need exams in order to rate teachers and so on, but they aren’t a measure of a child’s intelligence. “I remember being at school, and I could know a subject really well – then the anxiety on the day of an exam would get in the way.” With her children’s freedom of choice rippling our to virtually all areas of their le, including what and when they eat, when they wake up and when they go to bed, Dayna has been told by naysayers that they will grow up to be out of control. However, she insists that making everything available to them gives them no reason to push back and rebel.    Devin is already working as a computer programmer and Tfany has set up her own cleaning business as well as making money as a model and YouTuber. Dayna said: It is also very important to assume positive intent with children. Because mine live without punishment, they don’t live in fear of me. “Instead, they trust me and see me as a guiding resource. I give them all the information they need, for example, about healthy eating and why it isn’t good to spend hours on the computer, and then trust them to make the right decision – which they do. “It’s no dferent to how we, as adults, could, in theory, sit there and eat an entire box of cookies right now. We have the freedom to but choose not to – because we have the information and know that wouldn’t make us feel good.” Traditional methods of punishing children are also something Dayna doesnapost agree with when one of hers makes a choice she doesnapost agree with.  Shouting, grounding and use of tools like the naughty step, she believes, are humiliating for the child and do not address the underlying reasons for their perceived bad behaviour. Instead, she tackles conflict by calmly mediating and encouraging conversation. Dayna said: There’s such a huge focus on behavioural modication, but to me, that’s not the answer,” she said.    “Doling out punishments just teaches kids that power rules, and sets you up as an authoritarian rather than your relationship being a partnership. “Of course, my children act up like anybody ’s – but I don’t yell, or ground or punish them. Doing that would just satisfy my needs for peace and quiet, and not address theirs. “If one was to, say, snatch a toy from the other, I would ask, ‘How can I help here ’ I don’t want to talk about the snatching itself, I want to look at why it happened. “I am not blaming other parents in the slightest, though. I know they want to be loving and have a peaceful home le – it’s just that we are given the wrong advice.” Dayna’s unorthodox views on parenting have attracted criticism, which she used to take to heart. But now she has noticed a sht in attitudes and finds more and more people agreeing with her - although she is frequently asked how her children make friends without going to school. She said: “That is the first thing everyone wants to know. But I don’t see the age segregation in schools as socialisation.  My kids won’t automatically get on with someone just because they’re forced to sit next to them. “Instead, they have friends of all ages, which they make through their hobbies and interests, homeschooling groups and just by striking up conversations when they’re out, like you or I would. “Another issue I have with mainstream schooling is that it assumes everyone’s social needs are the same, when actually, some children don’t like being surrounded by other people all the time.” Though she is keen to stress that she does not judge parents who raise their children dferently to her, Dayna does hope that by speaking out she will enlighten and encourage people to follow suit.

I was so nervous and so excited at the same time. It was quite a feeling. I got down on one knee and said aposBec DeVaul, you are the love of my le. Will you marry me apos and she said aposyesapos. There was never any doubt in my mind that Bec would say aposyesapos. It sounds so cliche but since being with her, I completely understand why things never worked out with anybody . Being with Bec, itaposs just so natural and makes so much sense. I have never been more sure of anything in my le.  While Bec saying aposyesapos to Kylieaposs proposal wasnapost a shock, what happened next was. Bec said: I was so emotional. I had no idea Kylie was going to propose. By the time she got to the last slide, I was on one knee and I said aposKylie Westover, you are also the love of my le, will you marry me apos. Kylie added: I was so shocked. It was really incredible. Looking through the pictures, I was so excited. There were pictures from our first adventure together to recently and then the last slide said aposwill you marry me apos. It just confirmed for both of us that we are very in sync and so meant to be. After Trina explained how weaposd both reached out to her. It was so funny we had done exactly the same thing. Itaposs amazing how everything worked out.  The brides-to-be first visited the sculpture park in Ellicottville, New York, last year and fell in love with the beautul setting and works of art. After deciding two months ago that she would propose to Kylie on their one-year anniversary, Kylie knew the park was the ideal spot but wanted everything to be a surprise. Kylie told Bec she had a mystery date planned for their special day but didnapost reveal where they would be going or what they would be doing. First the lovebirds would have a romantic meal at a diner before exploring the park with Kylieaposs trusty picnic basket in tow - which actually only contained an engagement ring and bubbly. With the setting sorted, Kylie then contacted her highschool pal Trina to askshe could secretly take pictures of their date as she planned to ask Bec to marry her. Thrilled for her friends, Trina jumped at the chance to capture the surprise proposal - but had no idea what was to come. Just a week later, Trina was left stunned when Bec got in touch to reveal she also planned to pop the question on their anniversary and she too wanted some sneaky snaps taken.  Trina said: First Kylie got in touch and I told her it sounded fun and that Iaposd love to do it. Then about a week later Bec messaged saying aposBec has a surprise date planned for our anniversary, I want to surprise her by proposing, will you take some photos apos. I was like aposwhat in the world is going on apos. I have never known any couple to accidentally plan a dual proposal before. They both wanted their plans to be secret so they wanted me to be sneaky taking the photos. They both asked me to hide in the bushes. Bec didnapost even know where they were going. I really didnapost know how I was going to work it all out and keep what was actually going on secret.  Baffled as to how she was supposed to turn up at a apossecretapos location or take apossneakyapos photos both Kylie and Bec actually knew about, Trina set about forging her own plan. The photographer arranged it so both Kylie and Bec knew that Trina, her friend, her husband Josh Staedt, , and their daughter Eloise Staedt, one, were joining them at the park. While the couple both thought they knew why Trina had asked to come along, neither of them were ever aware that she was actually there to capture their aposdual proposalapos. Unbeknownst to the couple, Trina had also agreed to give Kylie and Bec the same queue for their proposals. Kylie presented Bec with a rose gold engagement ring with a black onyx as the centre stone and black diamonds down the band. And just moments later, Bec gave Kylie a rose gold engagement ring with a moonstone in the centre surrounded by a halo of white topaz that also extended down the band. While Josh helped out by keeping their daughter Eloise distracted, Trina captured the aposbeautulapos events unfold in a heartwarming sequence on shots.  Trina said: I spoke to Kylie and told her aposwhatyou tell Bec that myself, Josh, our friend and our daughter are coming along too because we like sightseeing apos. Kylie agreed that would work so then I messaged Bec virtually the same message but changing the wording to say aposhow about I ask Kyliewe can join you apos and she agreed too. I told both of them Iaposd brought my camera along to take pictures of the scenery. They both knew why I actually had my camera - or they thought they did anyway. When we got to the water, I said apositaposs really beautul hereapos. They didnapost know but Iaposd agreed that same queue with both of them. Kylie quickly turned around and got down on one knee and Becaposs jaw dropped. She couldnapost believe it. Then when Bec handed Kylie the picture viewer, Kylie was so confused. She had no idea what was going on. It was beautul. It was a beautul location, a beautul plan and theyaposre a beautul couple. It was so emotional even I was crying while trying to take the photos. It makes me so happy that Kylie found Bec. Ever since they started dating, Kylie has been so happy. Itaposs like her world is more colourful now.

That’s just football – the goalscorers get the headlines.“Shanks is big enough and ugly enough to deal with the pressure that comes with starting the season so well. He has looked asit has not fazed him.“As a coaching staff, you do want goals to be spread around the team and that will mean centre-halves having to convert set-plays, midfielders to chip in and wingers to be nipping in at the back post to score.“In an ideal world you would like that and we had that in the Dundee derby. That was the perfect scenario so, hopefully, we can get back to that.“I don’t think, however, that we can take anything away from Lawrence and play down how good he has been considering every new singing is a gamble.“He has been perfect for us so far.”Former Rangers, Wigan and Motherwell forward Lee also heaped praise on young striker Louis Appere for his performances to date.And the former Killie gaffer believes the -year-old is already a better player than he was at that age.“I think he is a wee bit better than me, to be honest,” Lee added. “I would say that, especially at the age he is at.“I am a big fan of Louis. He has the pace, ability and the stature.“I can only see him kicking on because he has a fantastic attitude.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d89fe7fe9b0d9.86144059-e1569331847465-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united coach mcculloch thinks side are ready to make it fourth time lucky","story":"Dundee United No  Lee McCulloch feels a change in atmosphere at the club has them prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.United have failed to win promotion from the second tier in each of the last three seasons.However, currently sitting top of the Championship table, Lee feels they are more equipped mentally this time to deal with the tests set to come their way between now and the end of the campaign.And the former Rangers man has put that down to the changes made in the playing and coaching staff since boss Robbie Neilson has come in.Lee said: “We had a meeting at the end of last season when we were all still hurting from the St Mirren game and we decided that recruitment-wise we were going to be looking at mentality.“We wanted to see what people were like away from the pitch too. I think it has worked so far.“We still have boys bedding in to the squad and I still feel we can get better as time goes on.“Over the winter months is a tough period for any team so that will give us a mental and physical challenge.“We are prepared for that, though. The atmosphere at the club on the training ground and in the dressing-room is really good so we just want the games to keep coming.”And former Scotland star Lee believes the players need to rise to the challenges and expectations they face every day working at the Tangerines.Asked what the biggest challenge for the players is, he added: “I would say it is coming in every day to an environment where you are expected to get better every day.“As a team and iniduals – coaching staff as well as players – we are all trying to get the best out of ourselves that we can.“That comes from a working environment where you don’t have any big egos.“It is about hard work every day and knowing that we should reap the rewards at the end of the seasonwe stick to it.”Lee also takes heart from the talented crop of youngsters coming through at Tannadice.“We are lucky we have so many good young boys coming through and we certainly have a fantastic U  team.“The lads in the reserves are really ready to kick on.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee seek back to back wins as united aim to bounce back","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan askDundee can make it two wins in a row as they travel to Morton and will United come back from defeat at Ayr  Elsewhere, former Tangerines boss Craig Levein is feeling the heat.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.35269527-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.35269527-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.35269527-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.35269527-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"poll do you agree with plans to ban high emission vehicles from dundee streets","story":"A Low Emission Zone for Dundee will come a step closer next weekcouncillors back the latest stage of development.Consultation on five proposed options for the city’s Low Emission Zonewill be discussed by Dundee City Council on Monday.Under the proposals, the city’s Marketgait ring road would form the boundary of the LEZ, access to which would only be available to certain types of vehicle that meet stringent air quality criteria.The LEZ will, at a minimum, exclude buses that do not comply with emissions standards, but may also penalise other vehicles such as older goods vehicles, petrol cars and diesel cars.What do you think of the plans  Saving the environment and our lungs, or a step too far Please vote in our poll below."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d8b39086fba80.83418101-376x564.jpg ","title":"shocked dundee family of nine told thomas cook replacement holiday would cost 16k","story":"A shocked family whose holiday dream was shattered when Thomas Cook collapsed were told they would have to pay more than £, to go on another trip.Heather Esplin, , and her husband Alan, , were due to go to Tunisia on Tuesday for a week with seven of their  children.The couple had booked to stay for a week, all-inclusive, at the SunConnect One Resort Monastir hotel and had paid £,.But this week the family learned their holiday plans were ruined and Heather desperately searched to seethey could salvage their trip.However, when she looked on travel website On the Beach, the cheapest holiday they could find was priced at an eye-watering £,, for one week in Majorca.Thomas Cook collapse puts Dundee couple#s wedding and honeymoon plans on ice\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp thomas-cook-collapse-puts-dundee-couples-wedding-and-honeymoon-plans-on-ice embed # secretFejSaJMwL\" data-secret\"FejSaJMwL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"She said: “I really couldn’t believe it.

in a nerve-wracking penalty shoot-out at Hearts to blow the chance of a semi-final clash with Rangers.Aberdeen missed all three of their spot-kicks with leading scorer Sam Cosgrove and Niall McGinn blasting high over the bar.Substitute Bruce Anderson also had his spot-kick saved in the quarter-final.Aberdeen were just three minutes from a Hampden semi slot only to lose an equaliser in injury-time to force an extra  minutes.McInnes said: “There is no more blame on those boys who missed penalties.“We are all responsible.“We all had the chance to win the game.“When it comes down to penalties they are not any more responsible than anyone .“Into the penalty shoot -out I thought I have the best keeper in the league and I have good penalty takers.“Unfortunately it did not play out that way.“Hearts took their penalties well and that is why they are through.“It was a sore one for my players and the club.”Leading scorer Cosgrove netted two penalties in regulation time to put Aberdeen - up.Injury hit with six players ruled out the Dons produced a strong performance and were agonisingly close to the semi-final when Hearts levelled two minutes into injury time.After extra time could not separate the teams the quarter-final went to penalties.Cosgrove took his third spot kick of the game, only to blast it wildly over the bar.McInnes said: “It is unusual to take three penalties in a game.“However Sam did what he normally does with the first one and for the second he went the other way.“Maybe he was a bit undecided because I have never seen Sam be so loose with a penalty.“I thought Cosgrove was magnicent in that first half in particular.“He led the line brilliantly.“We put a team together where some positions were maybe not as natural for some.“But everyone put so much into the game and we were so close to getting through.“Unfortunately we need to be watching the semi finals rather than taking part in them this year.”Aberdeen had beaten Kilmarnock away in the - season on penalites and also saw off HIbs on spot kicks last season.However the Reds’ nerve deserved them in the shoot-out at Tynecastle.McInnes said: “There are still a lot of positives because despite the injuries and despite the situation we put in a good performance.“The performance was good .“It is disappointing as we went to Tynecastle to win and we were good enough to win.“They put Halkett up for the last five minutes and got the reward for it.“If they don’t do that then we are probably in a semi final.“However they are throwing caution to the wind and it has paid off for them.“I just felt an inevitability about extra-time.“It just felt like it was two teams that had slugged it out and looked dead on their feet.”McInnes admits the Dons should have defended better for the equalising goal which forced extra-time.However he believes there was hand ball in the build up to that goal.He said: “It’s cup football, it doesn’t matter that we lost it on penalties.“We came here to win and get the club into the semi-final and I thought we were good enough to do that.“We’ve all been here before and seen enough games before where you’re never there until you’re there.“We should keep the ball better in the corner and make sure Hearts didn’t counter on us.“I thought Aidan Keena handballed it in the build-up laying it out to Mulraney.“I’ve seen it again and my feeling at the time was that it was a handball.“But we still have one more cross to defend and one more header to win.“We had to deal with a lot of that, straight balls, from Berra in particular.“I thought my centre-halves were brilliant at winning that first header.“But can we stop the ball getting out there  Can we stop the cross  Can we win the header  I thought we were good value for our lead.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d7b4cbb648680.75557429-845x564.jpg ","title":"hunt on to find the north easts funniest kids","story":"Does your child have you in stitches at their hilarious jokes  Maybe your -year-old has cracking one-liners, or perhaps you just know your little one is an up-and-coming stand-up comedian.Well, this is your chance to get your budding comedy prince or princess recognised for their undeniable talent – plus win a whole load of fantastic prizes too.Parents across the north-east are being encouraged to film their kids telling their favourite jokes and send the clip through to us on Facebook.To enter, parents must record their child telling one hilarious joke.This can than be either submitted using the form below, or sent directly to us on Facebook. vw, px\"  One very lucky winner will scoop a bumper prize including a family meal at the newly opened Mac’s Pizzeria on Union Street, family passes to ious child-friendly shows during Aberdeen International Comedy Festival and a meet and greet with one of the line-up’s top children’s entertainers.Aberdeen International Comedy Festival will run from October  until October  and will welcome more than  comedians including local acts, too. vw, px\"  The funniest little one will secure themselves family passes to Magic Gareth’s Man vs Balloon show on Saturday October  at am at the Mercure Caledonian Hotel, Mr Fibbers Back In Tune on Sunday October  at .pm at the Copthorne Hotel and the chance to see and meet SESKA at his show Quack Quack Bang! at The Carmelite Hotel on Saturday October .The competition is open to all children up to and including the age of .

Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

This area is also very popular with families who picnic on the flat land beside the river. Haylodge Park has always been a well-manicured park and this is what makes it such a beautul place to visit and use.He questioned whether the plans had been ldquoproperly thought through given that such meadows require upkeep and maintenance.He added: ldquoThese proposals seek to change the very nature of Haylodge Park which is central to recreational le in Peebles.ldquoThe intention to increase bioersity is a noble one, but where needs to be carefully considered.ldquoThe areas identied are heavily used, particularly along the waterrsquos edge and, in my view, should not change.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"ohara receives unanimous backing to defend argyll and bute seat","story":"On the day the UK Supreme Court declared that Boris Johnson had acted illegally in suspending parliament, and as he prepared toto London to resume his seat at Westminster, Mr O’Hara said: #In these deeply worrying times, I am both honoured and humbled to have received such an incredible show of support from our local SNP members here in Argyll and Bute.#Looking ahead to a possible general election, Mr O’Hara added: #When the general election comes, we in Scotland must be able to choose our own future.#Here in Argyll and Bute, this election will be a straight fight between the SNP and Boris Johnson#s Tories.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that

Sadly it is now the norm in the publishing world but as you will see again tonight there is a resilience - a bunker mentality that keeps us going.Thankfully all of those who have departed in the past  months have done so voluntarily. In many cases such as our sports reporter Alison McConnell they have opted to go freelance and had the financial cushion of continuing to write paid columns for us. We retain talent but on a reduced cost base.As with almost all industries, we need to continually adapt to new technology and new demands. That means taking advantage of process efficiencies and evaluating the importance and priority of resource.Were fortunate that with fewer photographers available in these constrained times, the modern journalist is now so multiskilled that they can take stills, shoot video and upload to site using only the smartphone in their hand. A letime away from the sacred art of developing film or even inserting an HD card. Its this combination of old and new that allows us to evolve and maintain quality, while enriching what we can offer our audience.As a national newspaper the quality threshold is much higher but that does not stop questions being asked and assessments made. In last weekrsquos show, our brilliant photographer Kirsty was filmed waiting for two hours in the torrential rain with our competitors to capture Prime Minister Theresa May. As an editor thatrsquos a valued picture. As a manager thats not the most effective use of her time, albeit we didnrsquot know the PMs arrival was going to be as delayed.And that in essence is the choices we now make. There is no right or wrong just a matter of balance and understanding of our markets and reader expectations.Similarly, the roles and numbers of those involved in the production process have been streamlined as we have taken advantage of technology and put more emphasis on getting it right first time.:Queen lsquoshould resignrsquo for her part in prorogation, says MSPWould I rather have numerous eyes on the same piece of reporting or fewer eyes on that single article and more reporters producing more content Reporters can now use technology to write their copy straight onto the electronic page, adding their own headline and providing picturesrequired - and filing it to our websites with links to added or associated content. I very much doubt I could have mastered all of that when I set out  years ago but for young journalists being truly multi-media is second nature. An iPad is the new comfort blanket for toddlers!Again, for a national newspaper, there is a higher quality threshold and we still need to ensure all copy is checked at least once for errors and accuracy. The small team work incredibly hard regard casting their eyes over thousands of words every day. Occasionally a typo will slip by and I apologise.That makes for dficult conversations and in that respect, we are no dferent to many other professions. Hopefully, though it will come across clearly that my managers truly care about the people who work for them and show the same empathy, honesty and integrity that is the hallmark of trusted journalism."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Our gardens are the frontline of climate change","story":"As rookies, my husband and I are feeling our way at this horticultural lark. After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-who-gives-damn-someone-","story":"Some of the greatest speeches in history seem sadly marred today when we look back and see this blindness to everyone on the planet who didnrsquot wear trousers. Neil Armstrong was a great guy ndash Irsquom named after him, so Irsquove got to admire him. But he blew his moon landing line by making it all about us fellas. It might have spoiled the symmetrical poetry of Armstrongrsquos famous quote, but it would still have been nice to hear about humankind. He did go there for everyone, after all.Language is a code for understanding the world ndash describing humanity as lsquomankindrsquo frames the world as male. So the culture war of the s and s which saw feminists arguing that the use of the generic lsquohersquo was sexist is pretty understandable. You hear the generic lsquohersquo in phrases like lsquowhen a child goes to school, he will learn reading, writing and arithmeticrsquo. Asgirls never went to class, only boys.When feminists pointed out that this felt a little unfair, all hell broke lose. The head of linguistics at Hard accused feminists of ldquopronoun envy, and the intellectual William Safire went into meltdown declaiming that to use a generic lsquotheyrsquo instead of lsquohersquo would be to ldquocave into the radic-lib forces of usage permissiveness.To cap it all, feminists were also asking men to call them Ms instead of Miss or Mrs ndash to make the point that women, like men, arenrsquot defined by their marital status. Had the world gone absolutely mad  What were these women trying to do to the sanctity of language  They want to emasculate men!So, wersquove been here before ndash with language used as a proxy in the battle against progress.

If you know a person wants to be called lsquotheyrsquo then what harm will it do trying your best to call them that  And likewise,you make an honest mistake and say lsquohersquo or lsquoshersquo then you shouldnrsquot be shamed or attacked for that. We need to recognise change can be dficult for some.I was brought up in a very feminist household so Irsquom lucky to not find such changes frightening or radical. To me, itrsquos just slow progress towards a world where we all feel as comfortable as we can about who we are. But I still mess up plenty of times.I know folk who are gender-neutral and use lsquotheyrsquo and lsquothemrsquo, and sometimes Irsquove accidentally said lsquohersquo or lsquoshersquo. No-one has screamed in my face and called me a monster. I wasnrsquot marched through the public square and pilloried with rotten tomatoes. The thought police didnrsquot helicopter in to arrest me and take me away for re-education. In fact, the only person to comment was me, with a slightly awkward apology usually met with a smile and a \"donrsquot worry\". If you try to be nice to people, theyrsquoll usually try to be nice back.Is it really concern for the inviolable nature of language which lies at the heart of all this anger  No-one seems to mind when ridiculous new words and phrases come into being ndash like turning google into a verb, or corporate gibberish about \"the strategic staircase\" .But when language is linked to women or sexual or ethnic minorities trying to level the playing field with us straight white guys, then boys, this is serious, and something has to be done.

That is the equivalent of slightly over one unit, or roughly half a pint of beer.The fact that that sounds insignicant is part of the reason researchers believe the policy is working: the majority of the population appear to be largely unaffected.In fact, when households were split into five categories ranging from those who bought the least amount of alcohol from supermarkets and off-sales to those who bought the most, there was virtually no change in purchasing habit among the first four groups.By far, it was the highest consuming households that cut back on buying alcohol - accounting for a weekly drop of around g per adult.The study noted that the reduction was greater in \"lower income households and only occurred in the top fth of households by income that purchased the greatest amount of alcohol\".: Mothers horror as son, , pulled unconscious from Renfrewshire loch - as paramedic said he did not expect boy to surviveHowever, the authors also stress that while the impact of MUP was \"greater on lower as opposed to higher income households, changes in weekly expenditure were not systemically related to household income but rather with increasing household purchases of alcohol\".In other words, the evidence suggests it is neither penalising moderate drinkers on lower incomes nor leaving heavy drinkers at the top end of the salary scale untouched.As research from the Scottish Health Survey reiterated this week, it is the wealthiest middle class drinkers who are - on average - likeliest to consume alcohol in potentially harmful or hazardous quantities. They are the least likely to be non-drinkers and one in four exceeds the recommended  unit limit every week, compared to % in the poorest communities.Yet at the same, time we also know that extreme, heavy drinking - such as  units per week for men - is more common at the bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum, and that the heaviest drinkers also tend to consume greater quantities of the strongest, cheapest alcoholic beverages.: Jeane Freeman to give evidence to MSPs on hospitals debacleNotably, th BMJ study found the largest reductions in consumption were for beer, spirits and cider.The authors state: \"Given that these categories include own-brand spirits and high strength white ciders that MUP sought to target, our data suggest that the policy has achieved its ambition to make relatively cheap and strong alcohol less affordable, which in turn should positively impact public health over time.\"The public health benefits could also exceed expectations. Before the policy was introduced, modelling predicted that it would result in , fewer alcohol-related deaths and , alcohol-related hospital admissions over the first  years compared to a Scotland without MUP.However, that was predicated on an annual reduction in alcohol consumption per drinker of around .% . In contrast, the BMJ study found that MUP has coincided with a .% reduction - . times what was estimated.Of course, alcohol purchased in bars and restaurants is not covered by the research - but since heavier drinkers tend to get a larger share of their intake from off-sales, and MUP had no effect on on-trade prices, it is unlikely to have changed signicantly.Nonetheless, Dr Eric Carlin, director of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems , said it was still too early to say with certainty that MUP had worked or was \"some kind of magic bullet for alcohol harms\".He said: \"Its really important to keep emphasising that this looks good, we expected it to be moving in this direction based on all of the modelling and based on the evidence from Canada. But we do have to wait and see.\"ldquoThere is every reason to remain confident that the benefits from MUP will continue to build.\""},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-not-elvis-nearly","story":"ROCKER Suzi Quatro, is heading to Glasgow for a QA session at the GFT, where a documentary about her le is being screened.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"fmqs nicola sturgeon accuses opposition of attempting to rig indyref2 question","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has accused opposition parties of attempting to \"rig\" a second independence vote when askedher constitution secretary Michael Russell was more expert on setting referendum questions than the Electoral Commission.The First Minister was challenged by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard over statements by Mr Russell that the question in a future second independence referendum should be the same as in  and there was no need to have it tested.However the Electoral Commission has warned the Scottish Government that to ensure the integrity of a second referendum it must be allowed to test the question, evenit had approved it previously as \"one shouldn’t draw any conclusions about what we would be saying now.\"Yesterday at the finance and constitution committee, which is scrutinising the governments Referendums Bill, Mr Russell said that despite the Commissions advice there was no need for the question to be \"re-tested\".He said that the Commission had agreed the question in the  referendum - Should Scotland be an independent country  - was of a \"neutral formulation\" as well as being \"direct, short and simple.\" Raising the Commissions objections at First Ministers Questions, Mr Leonard asked Ms SturgeonMichael Russell was \"more expert\" in setting a clear transparent and neutral referendum question\".Ms Sturgeon hit back saying the Electoral Commission was obviously more expert, but she did not know \"anyone across Scotland, except politicians, who seem to be running scared of the verdict of the Scottish people when that question is asked again. I do no know anybody who doesnt think that question is clear and understandable.\"She added: \"The question was tested by the Electoral Commission and, more than that, the question was tested in the reality of a referendum.\"Labour and the Tories have now realised clear they wont be able to block the right of the Scottish people to choose their own future, so theyre now wondering how they can rig the whole process.\"Mr Leonard said the \"people of Scotland had chosen their future five years ago\" and accused the First Minister or being \"prepared to disregard\" the integrity of a referendum process. He pointed to advice from the Law Society of Scotland which also warned against precluding the Electoral Commission from testing the question.He said: \"The Electoral Commission and Law Society both say this is the wrong approach, why dont you listen to them  What have you got to hide  Or are you simply trying to rig the process \"Ms Sturgeon said she was struggling to keep up with the \"twists and turns\" of his position on a second referendum, and added: \"If Im understanding him right, Richard Leonard is standing here today demanding we test a question, again, for a referendum that he also says shouldnt happen and hes not going to allow to happen. Thats the first inconsistency and contradiction in his position.\"Then he says people of Scotland shouldnt have a right to choose their future because we chose our future five years ago, the people of the UK voted on Brexit three years ago yet Richard Leonard supports a second Brexit referendum, and he seems to have missed all that has changed in the five years since the independence referendum when people like him were telling the people of Scotland the only way to protect their membership of the EU was to vote against independence, we now know those promises werent worth the paper they were written on.\"Commenting on the exchange between Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Leonard, Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “There shouldn’t be a isive and unnecessary second independence referendum.\"Nicola Sturgeon is refusing to listen to the independent Electoral Commission, but most importantly she is refusing to listen to the people of Scotland.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective. From IPCC  Report , Summary for Policymakers, Paragraph SPM .. .“Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale#, and.#Effective mitigation will not be achievedinidual agents advance their own interests independently.#The current, tawdry campaign is disreputable. It is based on Old Testament-style, apocalyptic prophecies, cynically intended to raise public alarm for grubby, political purposes and the Green Party is up to their ocksters in it. By far themost numerous deaths will be due to cold # excess winter deaths .Stick with international action, informed by IPCC science, please.Popularity at the UN is not a good gauge of morality or even right.Le is better when folk agree the dferences between people matter less than what we have in common. The attitude John Inkster appears to demonstrate is far more of a threat to the strength of Shetland culture than taking pride in the outward-looking, open-minded, warm-hearted and welcoming nature of most of his fellow islanders. Shetland folk music would never have developedthose playing it only ever stuck to listening to and playing the original tunes.Let’s remember the accordions came in fae sooth. If, in times past, the small-hearted and narrow-minded had called the tune, well there certainly would not have been so much Shetland culture to celebrate.Shetland culture has always developed in relation to other influences. There is nothing to fear that won’t be made worse by treating new Shetlanders or unken folk as undesirable.Accordions and fiddles are indeed dferent. What matters is what they can achieve together. Would that John, John and indeed John could dance to a dferent tune.Put simply, as long as humans put the concept of money, greed and profits ahead of anything , many of the problems of the environment caused by human activity will never be dealt with in a way which is harmonious not only to human le, but le and the environment as well.The driving force to human and social development is based on a system which is at odds and against the natural laws of nature.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Plus I’m never one to refuse a challenge!”Huntington’s diseaseis a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and behavioural symptoms.“There is no cure, it’s progress cannot be reversed or slowed down although this is the aim of a number of research projects,” continued Amy.“Once the faulty gene is triggered the person will slowly deteriorate but it’s a process that can take   years and as a result leaves a lot pressure put on the family and carers as the person becomes less and less mobile and more distant from the person they used to know.“The charity are always needing help with research and carers etc and just to raise awareness in general so I was more than happy to play my part by making people aware of the disease and the impact it can have on families.”People can donate at http:uk.virginmoneygiving fundraiser-web fundraiser showFundraiserProfilePage.\"  \"  These were the top  most complained about TV shows this year Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"All the money donated towards Amy’s challenge will stay in Northern Ireland. .action userUrlLeeanneMcLeanAll the money donated to that cause will stay within Northern irelandaction userUrlLeeanneMcLeanAll the money donated to that cause will stay within Northern ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"New-Bridge Integrated College Art Department is delighted to announce that art student Toni Maginess is Key Stage  winner of the Carson Prize.Education,  ..Banbridge celebrate Martin Luther Kingrsquos thDr. Martin Luther King, had he lived, would have been  years old this year.

I did Educating Rita at the Lyric and it felt right to perform Shirley here as well.“I was waiting to get to that right age in my career and we went into rehearsals in May. There is something about Willy Russell’s work that relates to me and to Belfast I think the humour translates exactly the same. Both Rita and Shirley have similarities, they are characters who want more,” she said.The Fall and In The Line of Duty actress said the play still has resonance today despite being written more than  years ago.“For many generations women have been told their place. Here is a woman that says ‘well this is what I want and I want to do it dferently’.”Tara spoke of how she “couldn’t wait” to work with acclaimed Tinderbox Artistic Director Patrick J O’Reilly on the production.“I knew he would bring such physicality to the piece, I never wanted it to be me playing lots of dferent people, it has to be Shirley. Patrick’s take on plays is always a little bit to the left so I couldn’t wait to see how left he would go and boy did he go left,” she laughed.“Right from the off Patrick and set and lighting designer Paul Keogan wanted the set to symbolise many things. It opens in Shirley’s kitchen, it’s stark, it’s white, it’s almost asylum like. Shirley keeps it so clean so the symbolism of her writing ‘Greece’ in huge colourful letters on a pristine white kitchen is a really beautul concept that Patrick and Paul came up with.”She continued: “When Act Two opens and Shirley is in Greece, she hasn’t completely left her le behind, she’s only gone to Greece for a fortnight. Her surroundings have changed but there are remnants of her le back home still on the stage. Because you change scene doesn’t mean you have changed, that change has to come from you and I loved that premise.“At the end of the show, her husband Joe is coming over to see her and she is excited by that. Willy Russell doesn’t knowthey are getting back together but they are meeting up. The character of Shirley doesn’t blame Joe for anything that has happened – or didn’t happen in her le. They were both these hopeful people when they married and somewhere along the way le got in the way, everyone in a couple can relate to that.”The former St Genevieve’s High School student does not wear a mic during performances, which helps herbe “intimate with the whole theatre”.“The character of Shirley is a gt, I always knew she was and I think there’s a Shirley in everyone.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

became one of the most notorious murders of the Troubles.Earlier this year, the Supreme Court in London ruled that there has been no “effective investigation” into Mr Finucane’s murder, and that previous inquiries had not complied with the Finucane family’s human rights.It also found that while Mrs Finucane had been given “an unequivocal undertaking” that there would be a public inquiry into the murder, the Government was justied in later deciding against holding one.Mrs Finucane said yesterday:  “In February the Supreme Court ruled that all of the previous investigations into my husband’s murder were ineffective and did not meet the standards required by European human rights legislation, and that it was for the British Government to decide how to proceed in light of the Court’s judgment.“Since that time two Secretaries of State have promised to meet with my family and our legal representatives in order to have meaningful discussions.“No meetings have been offered and the Secretary of State has left me with no option but to bring court proceedings.”Mrs Finucane’s solicitor Peter Madden confirmed that judicial review proceedings in the High Court were lodged todfay.

Siochana.Criticism came swtly on Wednesday evening, when it was revealed by Garda representative bodies that their members found out about the changes to locations and isions through the media.Ive been characterised as impatient in some quarters and I am a little impatient.Drew HarrisConcerns have also been raised about the reduction of isions leading to longer response times and reduced police presence, due to larger distances from HQs to certain areas now within their remit.The deputy general secretary of The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Antoinette Cunningham, said her colleagues deserved better.“We learnt of some of the downgrading of isional headquarters through the media yesterday,” she said on RTE Radio .“That shows scant regard for workers of any association to hear of the downgrading of their workplace not through the consultative process that you’d expect.“I share the concerns about downgrading, it seems that policing is being pulled into central isions and we do have concerns about the people in rural Ireland over how their area is going to be policed.”Speaking on Thursday at the Policing Authority meeting, Drew Harris stood by his plans, which he says will free up more frontline police, create a sense of autonomy for superintendents and improve community policing.“I’ve been characterised as impatient in some quarters and I am a little impatient,” Mr Harris said.“The quicker we get about this and get on with it, we’ll be a more efficient service.“What concerns me there is an inconsistency in one place to the next and I want to deal with that quickly.“What’s important to me is service delivery, using every euro we get and spending it wisely.”Day to day, Mr Harris says the public can be assured there will be more community policing in their areas, and more frontline gardai in general when the changes are implemented.“Within each ision they will have two community engagement superintendents, of sufficient rank who can make decisions, who can actually do something, and when they make a promise they can deliver on it,” he added.“The Detective Superintendent in each ision will be a specialist in investigation in crime, and by doing that, we’ve put a conduit in place who can take charge of more serious investigations and ensure consistency of approach when it comes to investigation of serious crime, particularly around criminal gangs and feuds.“All of these things we want to upscale our ability to take on, and have a more professional approach.”The force says a wide range of operational factors were considered when deciding where the new regional and isional headquarters should be based.These factors included: population, geography, projected growth, crime trends and workload across a range of work streams.The isional headquarters will be based in Galway, Castlebar, Letterkenny, Drogheda, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Wexford, Waterford, Anglesea St , Macroom, Tralee, Henry Stand Ennis.Losing their isional HQ status are Monaghan, Roscommon, and Sligo towns respectively, as well as Bray, Fermoy, Kilkenny, Naas, Navan and Thurles."},{"url":null,"title":"paul murphy leaves socialist party to

It also reminded them of General Charles de Gaulle’s attempts to challenge US hegemony.Mr Chirac insisted the action in Iraq was illegal and threatened to veto a UN Security Council resolution that would have authorised the invasion.His strong stance did not prevent the war, and damaged diplomatic ties with the US, but it helped Mr Chirac’s approval at home and among others who opposed the invasion.The war “was a mistake because it carried important and negative psychological consequences in the Arab world”, Mr Chirac said later. “And it was unjustied because the reasons given – the presence of pseudo dangerous weaponry in this part of the world – were obviously baseless.”No weapons were found, and Iraq later faced the rise of so-called Islamic State.–  election\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jacques Chirac in the garden of the Elysee Palace in Paris in  Seeking a second presidential mandate in , Mr Chirac looked doomed to defeat after being involved in several political scandals.He was facing his old Socialist foe Lionel Jospin, whom he defeated in , but in a shock result the two people to make it to the second round were Mr Chirac and far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, a pariah in mainstream politics.With Mr Jospin out of the race, Mr Le Pen’s presence in the second round was described as a “political earthquake” because of his extreme anti-immigration stance and convictions for anti-Semitism. In a rare show of unity between left and right, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through Paris against Mr Le Pen.Voters threw massive support to Mr Chirac, who was re-elected in a landslide victory, with % of the vote.– Smells and noises\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Copies of Jacques Chirac’s memoir Although he never sealed alliances with the far-right National Front party, Mr Chirac more than once flirted with its anti-immigration ideas to entice voters.In , four years before he became French president, Mr Chirac’s good-natured image took a dent when he made an infamous speech targeting immigrants at a political rally.Particularly ill-inspired that day, Mr Chirac spoke in favour of a ban on family reunication, taking sides with “the French worker” living next door to families of foreigners he said lived on welfare money in less well-off neighbourhoods.“Add to that the noise and the smell, well, the French worker, he goes crazy…. And it is not being racist to say this,” Mr Chirac declared.– Acknowledging France’s role in the Holocaust\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jacques Chirac poses with residents during a visit to Amiens, northern France, in  Only a few months after taking office, Mr Chirac became the first French president to admit the nation’s involvement, via the collaborationist Vichy regime, in the deportations of Jews to Nazi death camps during the Second World War.France had for years after the war contended that Marshall Philippe Petain’s Vichy regime did not represent France.Speaking on the rd anniversary of the July   roundup of , Jews – the biggest in the war years – Mr Chirac said France “delivered its dependants to their executioners”.– The house is burningMr Chirac repeatedly warned about the danger of climate change during his tenure.In , after a UN report said that humans were likely responsible for global warming, Mr Chirac pleaded for a “revolution of political action”.Although he failed to implement his good intentions into groundbreaking policies, Mr Chirac further raised awareness of the need for sustainable development at the  Johannesburg World Summit with a spirited speech.“Our house is burning down and we’re blind to it. Nature, mutilated and overexploited, can no longer regenerate and we refuse to admit it …” he said.“It is suffering from poor development, in both the north and the south, and we stand indferent. The earth and humankind are in danger … We cannot say that we did not know. Let us make sure that the st century does not become, for future generations, the century of humanity’s crime against le itself.”"},{"url":null,"title":"radar installed to monitor fastmoving mont blanc glacier","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"door now wide open independent nw university derry university group","story":"A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has responded to the report on higher education published by Julian Smith.We welcome the clarity provided by this report and intend to respond in full in due course.At the outset, we wish to thank Lord Andrew Adonis, the Shadow Employment Minister Mike Amesbury MP and the Shadow Schools Minister Mike Kane MP for championing this issue at Westminster, and also the authors of this report.The Shadow Education Minister Angela Rayner has also raised the prospect of Derry availing of Transformation Fundingand we thank her for that proposal.On initial reading, this report provides a roadmap as to how the North West can develop its own autonomous university. The door is now wide open for an independent higher education institution for the North West.It provides us with a once-in-a-letime opportunity for the city-region, as long as we are prepared to grasp it.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this

googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class. In ,  children attended the school.The writing on the wall came when a proposed merger with nearby Annsborough Integrated Primary School to create a controlled integrated school was abandoned in the face of falling pupil numbers.In May the Education Authority issued a document in which it stated that Castlewellan Primary would close and Annsborough Integrated would be retained.The document said numbers at Castlewellan Primary had declined ldquoto a point where the potential establishment of a controlled integrated primary school was no longer viable.The closure will mark the end of controlled education in the town. Castlewellan High School closed in  when it merged with Killyleagh and Quoile high schools to form Down Academy mdash now Blackwater integrated College mdash in Downpatrick.Mr McLean said staff would continue to give pupils ldquothe best possible education until the school closes its doors for the final time.ldquoI have been here for  years. It is disheartening when you put your heart into your job mdash as every teacher does mdash only for your school to be taken away, he remarked.ldquoWe are still a happy school, but it will be a very sad day for the school, the children, the staff, the parents and the community when it closes.All objections to the closure proposal should be made to the Department of Education, Rathgael House, Balloo Road, Bangor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick mum hosts charity singing competition in aid of ALPS  ","story":"THE mother of a Downpatrick man who sought help from a local mental health organisation during a low point in his le is hosting a local version of The Voice singing competition, starting this Saturday night.Joanne Flynn says she is organising a series of three heats and a grand final of the popular reality TV show at Fitzpatrickrsquos Bar in Church Street in aid of All Lives Are Precious .Joanne describes being amazed at the support her  year-old son, Michael, received from the non-profit community organisation when he was battling a bout of depression a few years ago.ALPS, which relies heavily on goodwill from volunteers and members of the public for its survival, offers support and services on emotional well-being, mental health education and suicide prevention.Joanne said: ldquoI am so grateful to ALPS. They acted fast and got him the help he needed.ldquoWe know too well that men in particular find it hard to talk about this kind of thing. Irsquom just glad my son did. I can never thank Ronan Gilchrist and the ALPS team enough. They are really a fantastic organisation.ldquoEven though Michael still battles with depression the counselling he got was effective. It helped him so much and we will always be very thankful to them.Joanne added: ldquoI want to thank all the local businesses who have donated to our raffle and to everyone who has contributed with their time and effort to help make each night a success.ldquoThe evenings also offer an opportunity for unsung local talent to shine.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision.

In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town.

Wins over Tullylish, Teconnaught and Ballymartin has propelled them into the last four.The only blot on their landscape was a defeat to Ballymartin, but they avenged that loss later in the competition. However, they have not faced any side as good as Darragh yet and Jody McGovern, Jack Haughey, Niall Rafferty, Conor Donnelly and Kevin Hegarty will have to be at their best and then somethey are to get the better of Darragh.Glenn, seen as many punditsrsquo favourites to win the competition, then take on St Johnrsquos in what promises to be another close encounter.Glenn may not have made the impact on Division  as they would have liked, but they have been impressive in championship outings against Liatroimand Saul, winning all three games in style.St Johnrsquos have been as equally impressive and wins over Annaclone, Drumgath and Teconnaught have taken them to the brink of a final.The Johnnies will again rely on the firepower of John Clarke, Marty Keenan, Danny and Chris McKay and Conor Morgan to get them over the line, but they must beware the attacking abilities of Mattie Bagnall, Denis Murtagh, Jarlath McConaghy, Jack McCartan and Patrick Brooks.The top clash of the weekend at Pairc Esler on Saturday night then takes centre stage with Clonduff out to ruinrsquos Kilcoorsquos double bid.Kilcoo, who are sitting pretty at the top of Division , look certain to regain their ACFL crown, but nothing less than winning the Frank OrsquoHare Cup will do a hungry Magpies camp.However, you have to admire Kilcoorsquos resilience and fortitude. The Branagan brothers just never know when they are beaten and when you have Conor Laverty buzzing on the edge of the square, anything can happen.Clonduffrsquos first priority will be to try and stop a supply line into Laverty and the OrsquoHagens, McConvilles and Carrs are in for a busy night of it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Sisters.jpg","title":"Sisters hosting night of music with Community Gospel Choir  ","story":"THE countdown is on to this Saturday eveningrsquos fundraising concert in Downpatrick in aid of Cancer Focus NI.Sisters Emma and Evie Telford are busy with the final preparations for the event in memory of their mum Lorna who passed away just over five years ago.The concert mdash which is being held at the Quoile Bar and Bistro at the Strangford Road in the town mdash starts at .pm.Emma and Evie have organised a number of fundraising events in memory of their mum to support Cancer Focus NI, a charity which was of great comfort and help to them in the run-up to their mumrsquos passing and after her death.A non-smoker, Mrs Telford died on September , , following a long battle with lung cancer.The Downpatrick sisters are keen to give something back to a charity which helped them, with the money they raise being used to support the Cancer Focus Family Support Service.Emma and Evie want to help other children and young people who will have to deal with the devastating news that their mum or dad is terminally ill.ldquoWe want to raise money for Cancer Focus because the charity means so much to us.

I own the property there and in its current state it’s worthless. “Right below the tower is the entrance to Top Shop. Right underneath the tower are the centre’s car parks and the depot for deliveries for everything within the centre.“If the apartment block is unsafe, how on earth is Chichester Street and Montgomery Street safe for pedestrians ” The management company said: “A structural assessment report has now been completed and its content was discussed with the management company shareholders. Those present at the meeting consisted of the shareholders and the professional consultants engaged on behalf of the management company.“The report indicates there are further structural issues to be addressed within the building but the management company is not in a position to elaborate any further on the content of the report. The matter must now be taken further through legal proceedings. “This is an extremely dficult position for the management company shareholders who have not been able to reside in their apartments since April due to the relevant structural issues. “The management company has to date and continues to liaise with the owner of the neighbouring commercial premises at Victoria Square.“The management company has not carried out a structural assessment of the commercial shopping centre and is therefore not in a position to comment on any matters relating to that part of the building which comprise the shopping centre premises.”Man dies following altercation outside Kenilworth house Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Victoria Square Shopping Centre issued a statement last week to say that it is not affected by the issues in the apartment block.

out. “Based on this assessment, Victoria Square Shopping Centre is not affected and continues to trade as normal.”It added: “We continue to monitor the situation as the safety of our customers and

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.
