A total of 600,000 15-year-old students from 79 countries and regions were surveyed and those from China, Singapore, Macao and Hong Kong were the best-performing candidatesMoreover, the 10 per cent most socio-economically disadvantaged students in these four Chinese areas \u0027also showed better reading skills than those of the average student in OECD countries, as well as skills similar to the 10 per cent most advantaged students in some of these countries.\u0027He cautioned that these four provinces and municipalities in northern and eastern China \u0027are far from representing China as a whole.\u0027Yet their combined populations amount to over 180 million people, and the size of each region is equivalent to a typical OECD country.\u0027What makes their achievement even more remarkable is that the level of income of these four Chinese regions is well below the OECD average,\u0027 Gurria said in a preface to the study.\u0027The quality of their schools today will feed into the strength of their economies tomorrow.\u0027       All of the Chinese students surveyed are from Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and ZhejiangBut Gurria also sounded a word of caution over the Chinese system, indicating that more care needed to be taken with regards to students\u0027 well-being.\u0027When it comes to those social and emotional outcomes, the top-performing Chinese provincesmunicipalities are among the education systems with most room for improvement,\u0027 he said.Looking at the results of the developed OECD countries, he said it was \u0027disappointing\u0027 that most member states had seen \u0027virtually no improvement in the performance of their students\u0027 since the first PISA survey of 2000.This outcome came despite expenditure per primary and secondary student rising by more than 15 per cent across OECD countries over the past decade.The survey said among OECD countries, the mean performances in reading, mathematics and science remained stable from the previous survey, in 2015, though some countries outside the group had shown large differences in performance.       The PISA survey is carried out every three years by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The latest analysis was carried out last yearAlbania, Estonia, the Chinese region of Macao, Peru and Poland saw improvements in two subjects over the last two decades.The OECD praised Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey and Uruguay for enrolling many more 15-year-olds in secondary education \u0027without sacrificing the quality of the education provided\u0027.Gurria also sounded a warning over how ready students were to deal with the challenges of modern world, where it is important not just to read but to sort good information from bad.\u0027Fewer than 1 in 10 students in OECD countries was able to distinguish between fact and opinion, based on implicit cues pertaining to the content or source of the information,\u0027 he said.Gurria said that while some countries had shown that socio-economic status should not be an indicator of educational performance, \u0027it remains necessary for many countries to promote equity with much greater urgency.\u0027\u0027Against this background, it is disappointing that in many countries a student\u0027s or school\u0027s post code remains the strongest predictor of their achievement,\u0027 he said."},{"url":null,"title":"Smith common surname English speaking countries","story":"Share this article The Slavic \u0027-ov\u0027 means \u0027the son of\u0027 and is used similarly to the suffix \u0027-en\u0027 on the end of \u0027Jensen\u0027 or \u0027Hansen\u0027 in Scandinavia.  Due to the high prevalence of Muslim citizens in sub-Saharan Africa, the most common last name in a number of African countries, including Chad and Egypt, is a variation of Muhammad, the founder of Islam. The most prevalent surname in South America is \u0027Gonzalez\u0027 which derives itself from a Spanish name, originating in the German word for \u0027battle\u0027.          Due to the high prevalence of Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa, the most common last name in a number of countries, including Chad and Egypt, is a variation on Muhammad, the founder of Islam         he most seen surname in South America is \u0027Gonzalez\u0027 which originates in a Spanish name, \u0027Gonzalo\u0027 which itself comes from the German word for \u0027battle\u0027     The Most Common Last Name in Every Country - NetCredit"},{"url":null,"title":"Bohemia lives New York Citys famed Hotel Chelsea","story":"Share this article His apartment consists of two rooms joined by a colorfully painted curved hallway, and is one of the most visually arresting apartments featured in the book.Notarberardino\u0027s apartment is filled with \u0027wondrous objects, photographs, furniture, and garments\u0027, much of which has been inherited from previous tenants. Of the first time he set eyes on his space, Notarberardino told the authors: \u0027I walked in and immediately loved it.

Home for the Platells was in what is known today as the inner-city area of Toxteth, Liverpool.         AMANDA PLATELL: Using the names of my great-grandfather Isaac Platell (pictured with his wife Ellen), who settled in Perth, Australia, and his first surviving son, my grandfather Charles, my good friend Simon Heffer had spent several hours tracing my family’s history with the help of an ancestry websiteJacob, it also transpired, lived and worked for his entire life on Merseyside. Far from becoming a renowned silversmith who crafted objects of beauty for royalty, he toiled as a labourer, working on the docks and on steam dredgers.I’ll admit that finding out my lineage was traceable to Toxteth, a place I identified solely with the terrible race riots of 1981, came as a shock. Although it was still a largely rural area at the time of my great-great-grandfather’s arrival, it’s a long way from my notions of French gentility.So I’m a Scouser, I thought. Well, I’ve always loved The Beatles, the closest Liverpool gets to aristocracy. I can do a pretty good karaoke of Gerry And The Pacemakers’ Ferry Cross The Mersey and I know all the words to You’ll Never Walk Alone, but that’s the sum total of my Liverpool culture.I had only been to the city once, for a Tory party conference at which we were warned we wouldn’t get a warm reception if we strayed far from the official hotel.Other than that, my knowledge of Liverpool was limited to tragedy: Churchill’s description of it having sustained ‘the worst single civilian bombing’ of World War II, and the disaster of Hillsborough.A few months after my discovery, I received a box of possessions from the family home in Perth.Earlier this year, my beloved parents, Norma and Frank, died within minutes of each other, a month short of their platinum wedding anniversary. And although their passing, holding hands into the next life after a 70-year love affair, could not have been more perfect, the agony of losing them — and, by extension, a dwindling of my connection with the past — has been hard to bear.Strange things happen when your parents die. There is a burning need to keep your links with the past alive, to honour who you are.So when, on opening the box, I found a book my Aunty Charmian had compiled decades ago on our family tree, it was with a renewed sense of poignancy.Aunty Charm was an amateur genealogist and had already made a detailed family tree, tracing our family back to Hagen. But when she first presented her idea of the German Platells to us, we roundly dismissed her thesis, as it conflicted with our family’s preferred history — that we were the persecuted descendants of French nobility.It wasn’t much later in the Nineties that she finally compiled her little book — convinced, I suspect, that it was our true story.         AMANDA PLATELL: My great-great-great-grandfather was, in fact, a man by the name of Petrus Otto Platell, not an aristocrat but a modest tailor who died in his German homeland. And while the eldest of his seven children, Jacob Freidrich (pictured), did escape his impoverished birthplace of Hagen, sailing for England and a better life at the age of 19, he was driven out not by religious persecution but by the potato famine, which struck Germany as well as Ireland, in 1846There was another reason for us rejecting her findings. According to Aunty Charm, there was a chance the Platells were descended from German Jews. In the Sixties and Seventies, Australia was dominantly, and somewhat arrogantly, white and Anglican. To our shame, none of us wanted to be seen as anything other than that.Not only that, but, having fought two bitter wars against Germany — 216,000 Australian husbands, sonsand brothers were killed or wounded in World War I and 50,000 in World War II — no Aussie wanted to be associated with the ‘killer Krauts’.Yet, as it happens, Charmian was partly right. Further research has since proved that the Platells were German Lutherans.So this week I decided to embark on my own genealogical journey, visiting Toxteth for the first time to retrace the footsteps of my great-great-grandfather and find where we Platells really came from.The first scrap of information I had to work from was that Jacob’s family had lived at 48 Harlow Street, a dingy cobbled road of small workers’ cottages, near the docks. Long gone now, they were described as slums in the 1930s and most have been knocked down.Jacob moved to Liverpool in the 1860s and married Ann Davies in 1869, aged 33. They had seven children and probably shared the tiny terrace house with another family. The accommodation would have been primitive: no running water, no lavatory, a shared slop bucket, a bowl for washing.Jacob’s house has long been demolished, replaced by another modest cottage with a driveway for a car, now occupied by Jayne, a single mum with two young children.After I’d knocked on the door, two of Jayne’s friends arrived with prams and babies for a shopping trip. I explained the reason for my visit. ‘So you’re a Tox babe now!’ came the reply.From there I went to the Platells’ next Toxteth home, another worker’s cottage at 9 Lavrock Bank, also demolished and replaced by a Sixties terrace. Mary lives there with her son and her three-legged dog, Molly, and happily welcomed me in.I wanted to see if my great-grandfather, Isaac, had been able to see, from the back window, the River Mersey where his dad Jacob toiled on the steam dredgers — and indeed he could have done.On a bitterly cold yet sunny day, the river shimmered just a couple of blocks away. ‘You still see dredgers going past,’ said Mary.No visit to Toxteth is complete without a stroll down Ducie Street, part of the Granby Four Streets community-led project that worked to regenerate an area which had become Liverpool’s fly-tipping zone, and which won the Turner Prize in 2015.Some may consider the lifeless, uninhabited, boarded-up semis plastered with graffiti a work of art. For me, it was a reminder of how sad some areas have become. All day I wandered around the streets, where council housing has mostly replaced the tiny cottages, trying to visualise what life must have been like for my great-grandfather growing up there.         AMANDA PLATELL: Isaac’s home in the blistering Aussie heat was a ‘humpy’ (pictured), a lean-to made of tree trunks supporting a roof of eucalyptus branches, with discarded corrugated tin sheets for wallsDid he go to school? Was he happy? Was he hungry? Was he already working at the age of 12 when he decided to leave for Australia? Was he excited or afraid at the prospect of leaving home?And was he seeking an escape from poverty or just pursuing a boyish adventure? I will never know.I guess they grew up quickly back then. As the eldest of seven siblings, he probably had to.After visiting Isaac’s family homes, my next stop was St Michael’s Anglican church, Toxteth Park, where his dad and mum became man and wife. The front door was wide open. Inside, the ladies of the parish were having their monthly morning tea.It may be a poor parish but the church is majestic, the biggest iron-framed church in Liverpool. The vast East Window above the altar — installed in 1857, 12 years before Jacob and Ann took their vows beneath it — is as impressive as anything I’ve ever prayed beneath. And as I walked down the same aisle Jacob’s bride had once trodden, the sun came out, filling the nave with a kaleidoscope of colours.Was it that which made my eyes suddenly water? Or the thought of an innocent young bride marrying a poor labourer in that glorious place, not knowing she would have to work her fingers to the bone to keep her family alive?Two of her seven children died before reaching the age of three, and she would face more heartache when her eldest son, Isaac, left for a new life in Australia, later followed by her second son.For although Isaac was searching for a better life, as his father had, the anguish of knowing you would never see your son again must have been terrible.The family died as they had lived, in poverty. Jacob, Ann and three of their children were buried separately in unmarked paupers’ graves. Although Isaac may not have known what to expect when he arrived in Perth, Western Australia, in 1881, surely the fear of poverty must have been foremost in his mind. In the only picture we have of him, he is standing beside his most prized possessions — his home and a water pump — even though his new abode was primitive even by the standards of 19th-century Toxteth.Isaac’s home in the blistering Aussie heat was a ‘humpy’, a lean-to made of tree trunks supporting a roof of eucalyptus branches, with discarded corrugated tin sheets for walls. His table, outside, was probably an old door his only chair an empty oil drum.Yet there is no mistaking his pride. Although he is wearing ragged trousers held up by string, as he looks out into the distance, hand on hip, his Roman nose silhouetted against the sun, he is a man with a future, free and happy.Isaac went on to marry Ellen and have five children. Only three survived childhood — my grandfather Charles (‘Pop’), his younger brother Billy and sister Doris.Pop’s childhood idyll was short-lived. His father died when he was nine, his mother soon after and the boys were placed in what, by all accounts, was a brutal orphanage until the age of 14. Somehow he survived this and went on to marry my grandmother Gladys and raise five children.The first of them was my dad, Frank, whose 92 years of life generated more love, laughter and happiness than his father ‘Pop’ could surely have ever dreamt of.The night before I set off on my Liverpool voyage, a friend asked me: ‘What do you expect to achieve? What point is there in raking over the past?’I didn’t know then but I do now. I feel some small pride that, for generations, the Platells were plain, hardworking families, people from nowhere who risked everything to escape a life pre-determined for them, prepared to cross continents to find contentment.The irony was not lost on me as I walked those Toxteth streets.I haven’t just inherited the family nose. I, too, crossed the world to find my real home — and ended up where my great-grandfather began, in England.Of course we were never aristocracy. We Platells are ordinary folk. But whether it’s the Mersey docks or the Aussie outback, our homes are still our castles."},{"url":null,"title":"Bird loving QLD woman socialises 50 magpies morning says helps relax","story":"Share this article Collette believes that more and more birds have been visiting her garden each day for breakfast due to food scarcities caused by the drought and ongoing bush fires. Her neighbour Frederick doesn\u0027t mind the early morning noise at all and has been shocked by how friendly the birds are and that they jump \u0027straight on my hand or shoulder\u0027. He has started to spend quality time with his young granddaughter Nadia, feeding them in his own backyard.    While Collette says the maggies will always be \u0027welcome at her home\u0027 she does admit there is one downside to the visitors each morning- the mess!\u0027I do come out every morning and hose now\u0027 she said.

He became a hate figure for the authorities and eventually fled to France in 1975. In 1979, his Czech citizenship was revoked and two years later he became a French citizen.His most famous works, including The Unbearable Lightness of Being and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, were written in France and banned in his homeland until the late 80s. His 1988 novel Immortality was his last novel written in Czech he has since written four more novels in French, the most recent 2014’s The Festival of Insignificance.The idea of restoring Kundera’s citizenship has been floated for years by authorities in the Czech Republic. In November 2018, prime minister Andrej Babiš announced that he had offered to restore the author and his wife Vera’s citizenship after a three-hour meeting with them in their favourite Paris restaurant.“It was a great honour for me,” Babiš wrote at the time, describing Kundera, who is often cited as a contender for the Nobel prize in literature, as a legend of Czech, French and world literature. He said he had invited the Kunderas to visit the Czech Republic, but said the novelist’s response was non-committal.Kundera now lives out of the spotlight and never speaks to reporters. After visiting his homeland in 1996 for the first time since he fled, Kundera has reportedly returned a number of times, but travels incognito.In a 1984 interview with the New York Times, Kundera said that the idea of home was “something very ambiguous” for him.“I wonder if our notion of home isn’t, in the end, an illusion, a myth. I wonder if we are not victims of that myth. I wonder if our ideas of having roots – d’être enraciné – is simply a fiction we cling to,” he said, adding that he had made the choice between living “like an émigré in France or like an ordinary person who happens to write books”.“Do I consider my life in France as a replacement, a substitute life, and not a real life? Do I say to myself: ‘Your real life is in Czechoslovakia, among your old countrymen’? … Or do I accept my life in France – here where I really am – as my real life and try to live it fully? I chose France,” he said.In 2008, Kundera was awarded the Czech national prize for literature but did not return to receive it. In 2009, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Brno, the city where he was born in 1929, but the author remained in France.That same year, he refused to attend a conference in Brno dedicated to his work, sending a letter to the organisers that jokingly described the occasion as a “necrophile party”.In the letter, which was read at the event’s opening, Kundera described himself as a French writer, and insisted that his books should be considered French literature and categorised as such in bookshops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d4c07eeeb017749f38cd05ed035d9518a2a574/109_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c7a473e2b0552594c1527a1cdcc5467","title":"swansea tidal power project launches 11th hour 1m fundraising drive","story":"Funds are needed to prevent Tidal Lagoon Power’s development consent expiring in JuneThe developers of a pioneering tidal power project in Swansea Bay have launched an 11th hour bid to raise over £1m to keep the project afloat.The company has just over three months to raise enough cash to pay for the development costs of the £1.3bn project before its funds risk running dry in March.Tidal Lagoon Power, the Swansea-based developer, hopes to raise “a relatively modest” £1.2m to undertake crucial planning work to prevent its development consent expiring in the middle of next year.The funds will be used to cover the cost of lawyers and planning consultants needed to complete the final applications before reaching the “cliff-edge” deadline in June.If the make-or-break fundraising fails the company would be unable to undertake the work, and its permission to develop the project would be revoked a few months later.Mark Shorrock, Tidal Lagoon Power’s chief executive, said the company must “remove the cliff edge from Swansea Bay tidal lagoon’s planning permission” if it hopes to save the project.“No amount of political will can resurrect this vital pathfinder project if the planning permission is allowed to lapse. That is why we’ve launched our new fundraise today,” he said. “By raising a relatively modest sum we can retain for the UK the option of large-scale, multi-generational tidal power.”Shorrock vowed in February this year that Tidal Lagoon Power would reboot the scheme with the support of local businesses after failing to convince Conservative ministers to hand the project a subsidy deal.The company now plans to approach “high net-worth iniduals” to stump up £2.50 per share, at a minimum subscription of £500, to top up the six-figure sum pledged by Tidal Lagoon Power’s existing investor base.Shorrock has already spent about £37m of investor funds on the project. Swansea Bay is aiming to generate 530 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity a year – enough for light and power for 155,000 homes – with turbines working 14 hours a day. The project has grown since its initial plan with the addition of floating solar panels to generate an extra 200GWh of electricity a year and help lower the overall cost.The company clinched permission to develop the ambitious tidal lagoon project in 2015 but last summer ministers rejected its calls for a subsidy contract which would cost energy bill payers three times as much per unit of electricity as new nuclear power.Greg Clark, the former business secretary, told the Commons in June last year it would be “irresponsible to enter into a contract” with Tidal Lagoon Power because of its high costs.The tidal lagoon project has found favour with the Labour party, which has promised to revisit the plans as part of its leader Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to “transform” the UK into a low carbon, green economy.The project also has the support of Plaid Cymru, which believes the project could help reinvigorate the Welsh economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7de41f29cfb4f323fd1f8936d0dea7dff5678f03/0_0_1920_1281/master/1920.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7524dc42e36cf6738085d1ab562d5f12 1010w","title":"black woman president kamala harris","story":"As a black woman, I did not see myself in Harris. Instead, I found myself in solidarity with the people who suffered under her watchSenator Kamala Harris suspended her campaign on Tuesday, citing a lack of financial resources. “I’m not a billionaire,” she penned in a note to staffers. “I can’t fund my own campaign.” Harris has also recently attributed her lack of traction to her identity, explaining that many “aren’t ready for her, given her race and gender.She is right and wrong about both sentiments. While she is not a billionaire, neither are the leading Democratic candidates, none of whom are funding their own campaigns. She sits comfortably at a combined $6m net worth with her partner, compared to Bernie Sanders ($2m), Joe Biden ($9m), and Elizabeth Warren ($12m). And yes it is true that some, perhaps many, Americans do not want a woman to be president, especially a biracial one. Yet an additional truth lies in Harris’ omission: many people are ready and excited for a woman of color to be president of the United States. Just not Kamala Harris. Progressive people of color rejected the idea that Harris could secure their hearts and votes solely because she is a woman of color. Running for office while at the intersection of many identities is not salvific. The activist generation that “voted for President Obama twice and still got tear gassed” during protests for black freedom felt viscerally the failures of identity politics in the streets, courts, and classrooms. No amount of “Black girl magic,” “Rooting for everybody black,” or “Trust Black women” hashtags could convince left leaning voters that Senator Harris could relate to the masses of women of color suffering in this country. Quite contrarily, Harris is criticized for expanding their suffering during her time as a prosecutor and state attorney general. James Baldwin, discussing the possibility of the first black president in The Fire Next Time, asked: “What I am really curious about is just what kind of country he will be president of.” We live in a country that is, in policy and practice, often militaristic, racist, classist, sexist, and anti-immigrant. Given the recent wave of social movements, from Occupy to Black Lives Matter, from the Women’s March to the March for Our Lives, people are being pushed to think more expansively about how to fundamentally change the country and themselves. And that requires supporting a fundamentally different kind of candidate than Clinton in the past, and Harris today – despite both of them being undeniably qualified for the job.In addition to accusations of campaign mismanagement and lack of financial resources, Senator Harris’ also fell short because she committed to a grassroots funded campaign without any serious commitments to grassroots struggle. Senator Bernie Sanders is probably leading the field with the most amount of unique donors because he offers policies most closely aligned with that the most oppressed face: debt, healthcare, justice, and education. Dozens of black women organizers and activists endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren because of her specific plans to help black women. Did these candidates outraise Senator Harris because they are white? Likely. But between these two viable options for progressives, and Biden capturing large voting bases because of his Obama ties and supposed electability, Harris could not maintain a base.As a black woman and lawyer, I did not even see myself in Harris, but instead found myself in solidarity with the people who suffered while she was Attorney General of California and would suffer under her administration, had she won the election. While she was the little girl who rode the desegregated school buses that Biden threatened, I was the little homeless girl struggling with absenteeism whose parent Harris would have threatened. As calls for solidarity, justice and dignity for Palestinians rose, Harris sided with Donald Trump and criticized outgoing President Obama’s refusal to veto a United Nations resolution denouncing illegal Israeli expansion into occupied territory. When she announced refusal to vote for a US border wall, she called for increasing surveillance and drones to increase border security - a virtual wall. And when a moderator asked her to reconcile her controversial record as a prosecutor at a town hall hosted by formerly incarcerated people, she responded, “There are a lot of people who have language now about it, but I would ask you to challenge them, ask them, what have they actually done to reform the criminal justice system? And then I’ll have more of a conversation with you about my record.” What Harris mastered in racial rhetoric and storytelling during debates, she lacked in substantive policy proposals for people of color.Notwithstanding the internal downfall of her campaign, Senator Harris’ absence undoubtedly reinforces racial, gender and financial obstacles that erse candidates face in presidential races. Without any significant changes, this cycle will repeat, even for left of center candidates like Julian Castro. I predict Senator Cory Booker, Deval Patrick, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard will all drop due to traction or resources, while white or wealthy candidates with equally flat or worse campaign promises remain, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden. The political system certainly expels candidates of color, but Senator Harris had much more than a resources problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4714e7b1561f09615e6ac9120bfeee40e0ee614b/0_188_5404_3243/master/5404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4a27a43e383243767a0be436adfbed","title":"no regrets activists who shut down power plant await sentence","story":"Members of WeShutDown stand trial for blockading the Weisweiler plant. Some call it ‘ecoterrorism’, while others label it a masterstroke in the art of protestA group of climate activists who shut down a lignite coal power plant in Germany said they had no regrets and were prepared to repeat the action, as they awaited the conclusion of their trial.The activists from the group WeShutDown blockaded the Weisweiler power plant near Aachen for several hours on 15 November 2017, by halting its coal-carrying conveyor belts and diggers. The energy company RWE, which owns the plant, claims the shutdown cost it €2m.The group has called its action “legitimate and necessary”, claiming that it stopped significant amounts of emissions from entering the atmosphere.“We prevented 26,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions which would otherwise have been pumped out in the several hours we shut it down,” one of the activists, going by the alias Wanja, said. “That’s the equivalent of the amount of electricity used by 2,672 people in Germany in one year, or 104,000 people in Tanzania.”The group, he said, “created a moment of effective opposition to this infernal machine – lignite is also one of the most ineffective fuels there is, only economically viable if produced on a huge scale.“By bringing it to a halt, we reduced the damaging emissions it produces, so it was legitimate and the opposite of criminal. We are convinced it was worth it.”The 37-year-old Wanja, along with four other activists on trial in Eschweiler, faces charges of trespassing and disturbance of public supply in a case that has received widespread publicity. Their act has been labelled ecoterrorism and industrial sabotage by some, while others consider it a masterstroke in the history of environmental protest in Germany.The accused are unlikely to face prison sentences, but could receive hefty fines when the judge delivers his verdict, expected on Wednesday.The activists said they want the publicity given to their trial to have the effect of putting pressure on the German government to act faster to phase out coal mining, which it has pledged to do over the next 20 years.WeShutDown has said it had made use of the trial, which started on 29 October, to highlight “the worldwide destruction of livelihoods through lignite coal combustion”.Its lawyers asked the court to hear statements from climate emergency experts to illustrate that their action was justified in Germany and beyond, because “air pollution is local, but climate change is global”.Rosa Gierens, a Finnish meteorologist from the University of Cologne, who is an expert on air pollution and specifically on how fine particles emitted from power plants affect human health, told the court that peer-reviewed statistical data proved that Weisweiler “caused 280 premature deaths every year”.The global impact was to be illustrated by a Tanzanian farmer, due to give evidence on how the power plant, by contributing to the climate emergency, had affected the livelihoods of people in his country.Seuri Sanare, 28, a member of the Masai community from Monduli in northern Tanzania, was refused the chance to speak.But he told the  that had he been given the chance, he would have explained to the court the devastating effects, including the lack of rain and resultant loss of grass and livestock on his community.“The knock-on effects are multiple,” he said. “People are having to go much further for water for both cattle and humans, at considerable risk to both.“Land is splitting due to the parched conditions,” he said, showing photographs of huge rifts that had formed in agricultural land near his home. “In turn this leads to social unrest as neighbours dispute whose land is whose,” he said.Women in particular were among the most vulnerable, he said. “They are having to get up earlier and earlier to go further and further for that water for their families, and because it’s often still dark, they regularly face rape en route and are vulnerable to sexual exploitation in exchange for water, particularly in the cities.”Wanja said the court’s refusal to hear Sanare as a witness, illustrated “that German justice is more interested in German suffering, but not suffering elsewhere in the world”.He recalled the night in November when he and 12 other ecological activists finally embarked on the action they had been planning for months. They had broken the skin on their fingertips sealing the ridges with superglue to avoid leaving fingerprints, and some were wearing nappies in anticipation of a long night’s sit-in. Wanja said that as he was running towards the power plant, he fell and broke his ankle. “But I continued, hardly feeling the pain probably because of the adrenalin,” he said.The group climbed over the fence “with surprising ease – there was very little to keep us out”, he said. They made it to the plant, activating the emergency stop buttons on the conveyor belts. Some of the activists chained themselves together on the conveyor belts, others on mechanical diggers, while Wanja climbed up on a tripod they had placed five metres above the tracks, unfurled a banner reading “Never Trust a COP” – a reference to the UN climate change summit that was taking place in Bonn at the same time – and settled himself into a hammock, listening as the plant literally ground to a halt around him.“I wasn’t scared,” Wanja recalled. “I was overwhelmed by a sense of intense relief that we had achieved what we’d set out to do, and relished the hours it took for them to extract us, knowing the longer it took, the more effective our action was going to have been.”A spokesman for RWE condemned the activists’ action, saying there was no question that they should be held criminally culpable for what it sees as an act of sabotage. “Just as if someone were to unauthorisedly break into someone’s private house and cause damages there, there would be a demand for compensation, so it’s the same in this case,” he said.He said accusations that the company itself was doing damage by producing energy lacked substance: “The company is producing electricity with a plant and equipment which have been erected and are being operated in accordance with democratic decisions and state approval. The company said the activists’ blockade had led to a loss in performance of more than 2,000 megawatts, forcing the company to buy in replacement supplies on the energy exchange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4e340f66f94dbb7acc4c1b4734bbd51dc7187c/0_185_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b8ee239a77466c99fe64fc1ba2eafa8","title":"paris climate deal world not on track to meet goal amid continuous emissions","story":"Slowdown this year in rising greenhouse gases does not negate long-term trend, finds carbon budget analysisCarbon dioxide emissions rose weakly this year as the use of coal declined but natural gas took up the slack, a comprehensive study of the global “carbon budget” has found.The rise in emissions was much smaller than in the last two years, but the continued increase means the world is still far from being on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, which would require emissions to peak then fall rapidly to reach net-zero by mid-century.Experts said it was much too early to take the slight slowdown in emissions growth this year as a sign the world was turning a corner in the climate emergency.Joeri Rogeli, a lecturer in climate change at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, said: “CO2 emissions wiggle from year to year, but it is the long-term trend that is important. The small slowdown this year is really nothing to be overly enthusiastic about. If no structural change underlies this slowdown, science tells us that emissions will simply gradually continue to increase on average.”Such structural changes could include investment in renewable energy, low-carbon infrastructure, and plans to make buildings more energy efficient. “As long as global CO2 emissions are not embarking on a clear downward trajectory it is clear that we are not only continuing to make climate change worse, we’re doing it at a pace faster than ever before,” said Rogeli.Corinne Le Quéré, a research professor at the University of East Anglia who contributed to the Global Carbon Budget analysis, called for stronger policies from governments to phase out fossil fuels.“Current climate and energy policies are too weak to reverse trends in global emissions,” she said. “Policies have been successful to varying degrees in deploying low-carbon technologies, such as solar and wind power and electric vehicles. But these often add to existing demand for energy rather than displacing technologies that emit CO2, particularly in countries where energy demand is growing.”Glen Peters, research director at the Cicero Centre for International Climate Change Research and lead author of the Global Carbon Budget papers, which are published in the journals Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters, and Earth System Science Data, said: “The weak growth in carbon dioxide emissions in 2019 was due to an unexpected decline in global coal use, but this drop was insufficient to overcome the robust growth in natural gas and oil consumption.”While coal use has declined in the US and Europe, new coal-fired power stations are still being planned in China, India and other countries developed countries such as Japan are funding their construction overseas.European leaders will make a fresh push to agree a target for a climate neutral EU by 2050, a leaked document has shown. The EU failed to agree an EU-wide 2050 target last June, after Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Estonia refused to join 24 countries in making the pledge. Estonia has since come on board, but the three other governments have not publicly agreed to the target, although officials hope they will agree, in exchange for funding in the next EU budget to help “green” their economies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88625568397e7cc94cf9f6e1fd7969719cc413c0/225_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad658df3fe9b302b691fd74be9f51912","title":"tackling ocean","story":"Greenpeace says efforts to restore seas’ ecosystems would boost their capacity to absorb heat and store carbonHalting overfishing and the plastic pollution of the oceans could help tackle the climate emergency by improving the degraded state of the world’s biggest carbon sink, a report has found.The oceans absorb both the excess heat generated by our greenhouse gas emissions, and absorb carbon dioxide itself, helping to reduce the impacts of climate chaos. But we are rapidly reaching the limits of the oceans’ absorptive capacity as our pillage of marine life is disrupting vital ecosystems and the natural carbon cycle.Krill – a species of small fish – also form a vital part of the carbon cycle in the seas as they move through levels of the ocean, and play a big role in the diet of larger species. But krill populations have been in long-term decline since the 1970s due to pollution, overfishing and climate change.Marine life at the other end of the scale also plays an important role. Large baleen whales are estimated to store 910m tonnes less carbon than they did before commercial whaling began, Greenpeace noted, while working to rebuild key whale populations would remove 160,000 tonnes of carbon every year.“The ocean’s biology is one of our best allies in the fight against climate change,” said Louisa Casson, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “But over-exploitation and our addiction to fossil fuels have pushed our ocean to the brink of collapse. Ocean protection is climate action – if we can save our ocean, it can save us.”Oceans are scheduled to be a key topic at the UN climate change meeting in Madrid, where governments are now discussing progress on the Paris climate change agreement. COP25, as the meeting is known, was scheduled to take place in Chile, a country with a coastline that stretches for more than 4,000 km and has a heavy reliance on the oceans. But political unrest meant COP25 was moved from Santiago to Spain.Protecting the oceans can also help make coastal communities more resilient against the impacts of climate chaos. Mangroves and coral reefs can act as a barrier to storm surges, yet mangrove swamps are being destroyed to make way for commercial fisheries, and coral reefs are being bleached by rising temperatures. Stopping the cycle of destruction could help reduce the impacts of sea level rises and the fiercer storms expected to arise from global heating.Greenpeace also called for a ban on deep-sea mining, made economically feasible by technological innovation but which remains largely unregulated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/beb48d6ec19c0ad547dcc2f527fb62ab1198f7d0/0_296_2471_1482/master/2471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8880c8cdc5f173cead765ccff348938c","title":"wildlife photographer of year lumix people choice shortlist 2019 in pictures","story":"Fans of wildlife photographs can pick their favourite for the Lumix-sponsored award from 25 images pre-selected by the Natural History Museum in London.

It was black with long sleeves and it came down below the knee, but it had a plunging neckline and needed vast amounts of tit tape. I wore it in 2000 to present the Q awards, which were always really raucous. I’d slightly tamed my dressing to be on telly, but when I was younger I was quite wild in my choice of clothes, so I just thought: ‘Why don’t I try something outrageous for fun?’ I wore this with a patent collar and took a riding crop with me on the red carpet – I really pushed the boat out!This was the same year I started presenting Big Brother. On the first series I just wore trainers, flared trousers and pretty tops terrible clothes really, but I wore them so I could run back and forth from the house to the studio – the show was live and there wasn’t much time. For the second series, I wore flat shoes again because I was pregnant and then, from the third series on, I mostly only ever wore black. My sense of style also changed and I realised I could bring a lot more of “me” to the clothes that I wore to present.Reality TV has changed a lot in terms of fashion – clothes from the early 00s were horrific. Perhaps we’ll look back on the 2010s and think the same thing. But people on Big Brother weren’t on the pull – they were just trying to survive 13 weeks in the house contestants on Love Island are, and when you’re on the pull you always want to look your very best. As I’ve got older, I’ve tried to be slightly more chic. I was talking to someone recently about crinkly knee skin and why that shouldn’t be embarrassing. It’s interesting that society makes us feel that tight, pert skin is the only skin that’s of value but actually my wrinkly knees have lived through a lot of stuff which makes me of great value. Embracing the way that you look is a nod to how far you’ve come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56a3d661109c8ade48f88a442364f44b76a281a6/0_10_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20c6c7a2e25ad0fd585d6e35ba647437","title":"the irishman oscars race national board of review win","story":"Martin Scorsese’s Netflix crime saga has picked up the main prize with Adam Sandler and Renée Zellweger winning top acting awardsMartin Scorsese’s acclaimed Netflix drama The Irishman has picked up this year’s top award from the National Board of Review, a sturdy indicator of Oscars success.The crime saga, starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, was named 2019’s best film, following in the footsteps of Green Book last year which went on to win the Academy award for best picture.“We are thrilled to award The Irishman as our best film,” said the NBR president, Annie Schulhof, in a statement. “Martin Scorsese’s masterful mob epic is a rich, moving, beautifully textured movie that represents the best in what cinema can be.”Steven Zaillian also picked up the prize for best adapted screenplay for the film.

Recipes continually tell me to add one or two sticks of celery to a soup or stew. But what am I meant to do with the rest of the bunch?Max, Bicester, OxonFeast’s own Little Miss Perfect, Felicity Cloake, isn’t what you’d call a celery enthusiast. “It’s vile raw,” she spits. “Stringy, and as bitter and minerally as a dishwasher tablet. Ugh!” Cooked, she can live with the stuff, she admits, “but the only way I’d countenance raw celery is as my mum used to serve it, with a ribbon of Primula down the centre”. But Max asks a sensible question – what do you do with the rest of the head once you’ve used up a stick or two in a soffritto, stew or cream cheese-smeared treat? – so we’ll give refuseniks a wide berth from hereon in.Chef Anna Tobias, by contrast, is a celery cheerleader. “It’s so aromatic,” she swoons, “with delicate, earthy notes similar to parsley, only more subtle. It’s in the foundations of so many dishes that, if it wasn’t there, you’d miss it.” But, she adds, there’s a big difference between those pale, thin-stalked, plastic-wrapped supermarket bundles and the butch, green behemoths with a forest of leaves that you get at decent markets.The obvious solution to Max’s issue, especially in winter, is soup, says Tobias, who cut her teeth at Blueprint Cafe in its 2000s heyday, before moving on first to the River Cafe and then the head chef gig at Rochelle Canteen she’s currently looking to open her own place in London next year. “It’s a cinch, and has very few ingredients. Saute chopped celery and onion in butter, add a bit of cream, blitz, season and it’s job done.”You could also turn your excess into an equally warming braise or gratin, but Tobias turns up the celery gauge even higher and uses it as the main ingredienta rather out-there stuffing, an idea nicked off her mum, a fellow fan girl: “Sweat lots of chopped celery with a couple of onions in a fair bit of butter, then add loads of lemon zest and some juice, and stir in the chopped celery leaves.” It goes remarkably well with chicken and turkey, she says, so that’s maybe one to bookmark for the Christmas bird.“The Chinese use celery a lot, too,” says Tobias, now warming to her task, “especially in stir-fries, it can really take a sharp, high heat. Try it with lamb and lots of ginger – that’s yummy. Or go Italian, and fry it in oil with chopped garlic and chilli, then stir in some cooked pulses – a tin of chickpeas is great with that.”Tobias is in good company with her celery crush. Joyce Molyneux, in her The Carved Angel Cookery Book, swears by roasting it with pheasant and port, saying this “time-honoured combination outlives the fleeting fashions of the food world”, a sentiment from the 90s we could all do with getting behind now. And Jane Grigson, in her iconic Vegetable Book, goes so far as to give it shared top billing with aubergine in southern Italy’s favourite melanzane antipasto, caponata, and who are we to argue with the the likes of her?That said, her celery sauce to go with boiled turkey in English Food is maybe pushing it a bit far, seeing as that features an entire head, chopped, boiled for 20 minutes, then drained, sauteed in butter and mixed with 500ml bechamel before being pureed. As for Grigson’s jugged celery – the stalks are stuffed in a jar of apple puree with bacon – something tells me that’s probably even more of an acquired taste. *waves at Felicity*• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Actually, there has not been a press briefing during his short time at Tottenham when he has failed to do so. Yes, the manager is starring in an Amazon Prime documentary about the club’s season.Mourinho was at it again on Tuesday morning, as he previewed Wednesday night’s visit to his former club Manchester United, which, incidentally, will be carried live by Amazon Prime. Turning his head down and towards the inside of his collar and the ever-present mic, he mentioned the US company and had a bit of fun speaking directly to them.There would be a twist. “I’m also doing an episode for Netflix,” Mourinho said, before detailing his involvement in a sports documentary for Amazon’s great rival. “There are eight coaches from eight different sports, I’ve filmed it already. I don’t know when it comes out.” Cue the mock conspiratorial flourish. “But Amazon guys, they cannot know.”It was classic Mourinho, an example of his adherence to the have‑cake‑and‑eat‑it model. In Amazon’s big week of Premier League football here was one of its poster boys jumping into bed with the enemy. But do not call it a mis-step, because Mourinho was in no danger of making a blunder.On the eve of his Old Trafford return, he went to great lengths to ensure there was not so much as a syllable out of place when it came to United – the club he left last December under storm clouds.It was easy to imagine what Mourinho might have wanted to say, starting with Paul Pogba, United’s £89m player who he found so difficult to manage, particularly after the France midfielder reported for last season as a World Cup winner. Or how about the record of his successor, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who has taken 26 points from 22 league games since being confirmed in the job on a permanent basis? Mourinho’s last 22 matches at United brought 35 points. Then there is Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman with whom he clashed over recruitment.Mourinho has not disparaged United and he was not about to do so before the game. On the contrary. His relationship with United fans is strong – they sang his name when he went back to Old Trafford as a TV pundit, which “humbled” him. Mourinho wanted to make it clear he enjoyed good friendships with many of the club’s staff – from Woodward and the director Richard Arnold to the chef, who “calls me to ask how I am”.“I’ve had this at every club – at Christmas, on the phone will be Ed Woodward, Florentino Pérez, Massimo Moratti, Pinto da Costa,” Mourinho said, bringing in the presidents of Real Madrid, Internazionale and Porto respectively, although overlooking Roman Abramovich of Chelsea. “You have relations with people and this is very important.”Mourinho described United as a “closed chapter”, an experience that is “in my history book”. He wanted to speak only about the club as an opponent. “I’m not a villain, I’m not an enemy,” he said. “I am the coach trying to win against United – that’s how the United fans are going to look at me.”For Mourinho it always comes down to trophies. “Mr Mandela said you never lose, you win or you learn,” he said. “At United, I won and I learned.” He did not go into specifics as to what he had learned, other than to say he and his assistants had not looked to blame anyone other than themselves for how it ended, but he was happy to remember the trophies.Mourinho feels he is a “better coach now than when I was there”and he continues to whisper sweet nothings into the ears of his Spurs players. He said he is “in love with” Son Heung-min and Dele Alli could achieve “anything he wants”. The contract rebels, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen, are “great professionals”. This is what Mourinho does in the early stages. From leading players down to the ballboys, it is about bolstering belief, instilling a shared sense of purpose.Spurs go to United brimming with confidence after three wins out of three for Mourinho, who is projecting an image of total happiness. Not that he was unhappy in Manchester, where he lived in an apartment at the Lowry hotel – a subject of no little lampoonery.“I would be unhappy if I was in a house on my own,” Mourinho said. “I would have to clean I don’t want. I would have to iron I don’t know how to. I have to cook … I would cook fried eggs and sausages – that’s the only thing I can do. I lived in an amazing apartment – a flat with ‘bring me a latte, please’, or ‘I don’t want to go down for dinner, bring my dinner up’. I had everything. I was more than fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822289e29382df17a54ac5216172f342495b3241/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1c9088bdcc07067e3717097010c47583","title":"making waves dadaab refugee camps only female radio journalist","story":"Exiled Somali Kamil Ahmed says her job at Gargaar FM is more important than ever as the threat of closure hangs over the campSitting in a small shipping container, Kamil Ahmed, 20, prepares to begin her live radio show.“I feel like the whole community is waiting for me,” the only female reporter at the station says, flicking through her notebook.This makeshift studio is home to the only radio station in Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camp. Broadcasting a Somali-language programme, Gargaar FM (the name means assistance in Somali) provides vital information to more than 200,000 people who call Dadaab home, and serves as a source of entertainment and psychosocial support for refugees trapped in the isolated camp, first established in 1991.Today Ahmed is going to be talking about the importance of breastfeeding. “So many people call in when we discuss such topics, most are women because subjects like breastfeeding exclusively affects them.”The thirst for information has never been greater here. Kenya announced the closure of the complex about three years ago, so residents live with the uncertainty of the camp’s future and the threat of returning to the conflict in Somalia.Feeling cut off from the rest of Kenya and east Africa, refugees in Dadaab cling to their radios to keep up with local and regional news.“Gargaar FM station has been one of the most effective mediums in communicating with refugees in Dadaab,” says Assadullah Nasrullah at UNHCR’s Dadaab office. “It helps disseminate important messages to the refugee population on healthcare, education, voluntary repatriation, registration and other humanitarian programmes.”Gargaar FM also connects people to the outside world via the BBC World Service and Voice of America service.“We cannot just rely on what the UN and aid organisations tell us, we have to get an independent source of information,” says Fadumo Ahmed, a mother of five who runs a small grocery stall in the camp. “The imminent closure of the camp has affected everything including our businesses and livelihoods so the radio is important in keeping us up to date on Kenya’s changing political moves.”The station is supported by the UNHCR but run by a group of young journalists who studied and grew up in the sprawling camp.Ahmed was nine when her father was killed in Mogadishu in 2008. She witnessed her pregnant mother’s grief coupled with her desperation at the loss of the family’s breadwinner. They had to flee the country and came to Dadaab to rebuild their lives. “I lost my father, my home town and my school,” recalls Ahmed. “But I found peace and hope in Dadaab and I immediately enrolled in school.”But opportunities in the camp are limited.“I didn’t get the chance to go to high school after completing my primary education so I enrolled in a one-year after-school youth programme run by the Norwegian Refugee Council where I received basic journalism training,” she says.Almost all of the girls who started the course with her have dropped out or returned to Somalia, making her the only female journalist working in the camp.Her voice on the airwaves has encouraged other girls to apply for internships at the station. “I am now training young girls who just joined us,” she smiles. “It is also good for me because I would have people that I can rely on and who would support me and fill my position when I am not working.”But not everyone in this conservative community is happy with Ahmed’s work. Some discourage her from doing a “man’s job” and tell her she should get married instead.“I am actually proud of what I do and many people respect me a lot but there are many others who don’t like my career choice. They put on me too much pressure but I just laugh it off when they try to push me into marriage,” she says. “I have a loving mother who supports me and stands by me all the time. She is the only person whose advice I would heed.”She believes her ambition is bigger than the challenges. She wants to go to university and eventually return to Somalia despite being fully aware that it is one of the most dangerous places to be a journalist.“ I know how dangerous it is for people like me but I would really like to go back,” she says. “My mother would never allow me to risk my life so I just have to wait in this prison-like camp.” Many here refer to Dadaab as an open prison because of the Kenyan government’s strict encampment policy. For many the lack of identity and freedom of movement is crippling their potential.“If I apply for training or media workshops in other countries, I would not be able to attend because I don’t have an identity card or passport with which I can travel. This discourages me from actively searching for opportunities outside of Dadaab,” she says.It is a frustration echoed by the young people who make up the bulk of the camp’s population. The radio, therefore, serves as an important connection to the outside world.When Gargaar FM first went on air in 2013, there were about half a million people in Dadaab, more than five times its original capacity. It is now closer to 217,000.But it is the importance of her work that drives Ahmed on, and she produces, edits and presents her own stories and programmes.“It is a lot of work and there are only a handful of staff here so we have to utilise the limited resources we have in the station,” she says. “But when you have a whole community depending on you for their information you have to do everything it takes to meet their expectations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab662e22afc342012cbf3b3a1cff9bddc59f5dc0/759_309_3779_2267/master/3779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69fffd573b695c4e9c5be8fe9e303bc2","title":"wheres the beef the chefs creating plant based meat alternatives","story":"From burgers to sausages, meat-free alternatives are gaining shelf space. Jason Deans meets Derek Sarno, the vegan chef creating them From roasts to ready meals, barbecues to takeaways, the meat we eat might be changing. The future? Decidedly higher in veg, if the numbers are to be believed.It’s a rapidly growing market and – helping as it does to create a more sustainable food supply system – one that makes clear ethical sense.It’s an interesting dichotomy, growing demand set against mixed perception, and one that supermarket chain Tesco is trying to tackle. It’s expanding its own-label plant-based ranges Wicked Kitchen and Plant Chef to more than 100 products, offering vegan substitutes to meat-based dishes ranging from cottage pie and southern fried chicken to Cumberland sausage, spaghetti bolognese and meatballs – and putting them in the meat aisle.The chain hired Derek Sarno to spearhead the shift, joining a dedicated Tesco team as its director of plant-based innovation – their mission to develop innovative (but affordable) vegan alternatives to meat.Sarno, a Veganuary ambassador, is co-founder with his brother Chad of Wicked Healthy, an online community promoting plant-based cooking. Motto: “We make vegan food for meat eaters.”Sarno moved from the US to London in 2017. Before he became a vegan, Sarno worked as a chef cooking meat dishes and he has since applied techniques he learned then to plant-based alternatives.Visiting UK supermarkets two years ago to check out what plant-based ready meals and food-to-go was on the shelves was bit of a culture shock. “When I first came to the UK as a vegan there was nothing for me to eat in the retail market apart from a falafel wrap,” Sarno recalls.There was a clear opportunity, both from a business and ethical point of view.“It’s the right thing to be doing,” says Sarno. “The whole thing about plant-based is it gives the customer a choice to actually do something with their money to buy the products that help,” he says.“There’s an ethical reason behind what I do, personally. But I understand any reason to have people eat more plant is a good reason, so I’m on board with all of it.”Sarno worked with long-standing Tesco suppliers Bakkavor and Samworth Brothers to launch the Wicked Kitchen own-brand range of vegan ready meals, sandwiches, salads, and pizzas, in January 2018. It has since expanded into desserts. Wicked Kitchen is already a £26m brand, according to Tesco, with 10m units shifted in 20 months.In September, Tesco launched a second plant-based own-brand range, Plant Chef, including Butternut Cauli Mac and Battered Fish-Free Fillets. Sarno describes Wicked Kitchen as “very innovative and chef-crafted”, comparable to Tesco’s higher-end Finest range while Plant Chef focuses on more accessible, affordable dishes and classic family favourites.Both Bakkavor and Samworth Brothers have decades of experience in the food business, but it still proved quite an eye opener sending their chefs out to the US to work with Sarno in his Portland home in 2017, buying vegetables in local farmers’ markets and taking them back to his kitchen to start the development process that led to the Wicked Kitchen and Plant Chef ranges.“One of Derek’s signatures is he’ll take the king oyster mushroom and then cook it between two cast iron frying pans and compress it as he’s cooking and it turns into something eventually that is like steak,” says Neil Rockliff, innovation director at Samworth Brothers.“What we learned with Derek’s input was to approach vegetables and almost treat them like meat. The veg butcher effect … How do we cut the vegetable in a different way to make it look different? How do we cook it in a different way, how could we pickle it, or cure it, or smoke it, and think about making it more interesting?”The challenge for both companies was to adapt Sarno’s techniques to create mass market plant-based products. Rockliff’s team came up with a system of loading marinated oyster mushrooms in large baking trays and then compressing, roasting and shredding them to use in ready meals or food-to-go. The company is also working with natural pea derivatives to give texture, moisture and enhance flavour, to help create meat-like products. It is using seaweed derivatives to provide a replacement for sausage skin.Similarly, Bakkavor has developed other meat-free methods including: charring and smoking tofu creating a plant-based mozzarella for pizzas “that will give a nice stringy effect” developing cream and milk alternatives with oat milk and using pickled, marinated vegetables such as celeriac as food-to-go fillings.Lewis agrees: “I don’t think we’ve seen anything like that in the last five years … I think the plant-based sector is just going to grow and grow. It’s the fastest growing category we work on.”By January, Tesco aims to have increased its plant-based offering to about 300 items, introducing dedicated plant-based and vegetarian zones in stores, and adding vegan products to fresh food, grocery, frozen and meat aisles.Rockliff adds: “We’re going to allow people, if they want to buy a prepared cottage pie, to have a meat version or a plant version. Same on sausages, same on burgers, etc, etc … From what I’m seeing, customers will have more and more choice between eating meat and choosing very credible meat alternatives that are simply made out of plants.”Plant powerWhether they’re interested in exploring plant-based “meat” for their health, the environment or simply variety, Tesco is set on giving its customers all the options to make healthier, more sustainable food choices. That’s why, as well as creating innovative meat alternatives, the supermarket is working with suppliers to modernise production and cut food waste.

You have a world to win.”O’Neill, 44, is from Bishop Auckland. Over the years he has been involved in numerous community projects, most recently raising funds for a memorial to Cpl Lee Brownson, a local boy who was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. Through O’Neill’s efforts, the railwaymens’ banner is now proudly on display at the Four Clocks Centre in Bishop Auckland, alongside a small exhibition telling the story of the world’s first steam locomotive railway line, which passed through the area.For a lifelong Labour voter, this was an act of loving commemoration. But in less than two weeks time, O’Neill will vote Conservative in the general election. “I’ve been a Labour member and my family has always voted Labour,” he says, “but the party around here has turned nasty in my opinion, since the Brexit referendum. I voted to leave, but leave voters are being called racist and far right, which is not how it is. We have a local Labour MP in Helen Goodman who should be standing up for democracy. It shouldn’t matter that she voted remain.”The significance of what would amount to a political revolution in the town everyone calls Bishop is not lost on O’Neill: “Ten years ago, a Conservative MP wouldn’t get the time of day on the doorstep around here. This place is steeped in memories of the Thatcher era and the mines and the steelworks. But I’m not alone in turning against Labour.”In a region which feels its collective voice and concerns have been ignored since the mines closed and other industries went the same way, Labour leave voters saw Brexit as carrying the possibility of social renewal. The failure of the party to fully endorse the referendum result is seen by former supporters like O’Neill as both dishonourable and a sign that the party has moved away from its working-class roots. Goodman’s much-diminished majority – in 2005, it was over 10,000 - also suggests Labour is paying the price of long-term local incumbency in an era of deepening disillusionment across the region.The mining town of Spennymoor and the surrounding pit villages sit within a constituency that was part of one of the richest, most culturally vibrant coalfields in Europe. Twenty-five years after the last pit closed, there is a palpable longing to restore a lost sense of purpose and cohesion and an anger at the way that the infrastructure of communal life has been allowed to corrode and decay.In Bishop Auckland, the closure of the local A\u0026ampE has become a major election issue. Davison is promising to re-open it. Sarah Bryson, a mental health nurse who commutes to work in Durham, is sceptical. “Brilliant, but how?” she says. “It would be great to have a fully functioning hospital on every doorstep, but that’s just not where we are at.”Nevertheless, Bryson sympathises with those who campaigned against the closure. “This town and surrounding areas have lost their connection to a lot of things the idea of the closure of a hospital seems to sum that up in people’s minds. It gives a sense that somehow this area isn’t worthy.”The high street, one of Britain’s longest, has been in steep decline for a while. This month, Bernadette Rush will vacate No 136, where she has run Image, a bridal shop, for eight years. “There’s been a huge dip in sales,” she says. “People are either buying on-line or from out-of-town suppliers who are manufacturing dresses offshore far cheaper than I can buy them for.” For the past few years, Rush, a skilled seamstress, has made her living from making alterations to dresses bought elsewhere. She now plans to work from home, freeing herself from the overheads.Twenty per cent of town centre business units are vacant, including the Victorian co-op building which, until 2017, housed Beales department store. The site has been earmarked for either a hotel or apartments, but for now it sits like an open wound in the centre of Bishop Auckland. “A lot of places in the high street are owned by absent landlords and they are just left to rot,” says Rush. “They just look a mess. It’s very unsightly.”Like many other residents, Rush hopes a singular turn of events may yet turn the town’s fortunes around. Last month, Auckland Castle, the medieval home of the prince bishops of Durham, was opened to the public. Restored, its 18th-century Long Dining Room displays work by the 17th-century artist Francisco de Zubarán, sometimes known as the “Spanish Caravaggio”. Elsewhere, visitors can see Nicolas Poussin’s The Triumph of Pan, which is on loan from the National Gallery.The slightly surreal Auckland Project’ is the £150m brainchild of Jonathan Ruffer, a City investor from Stokesley, near Middlesbrough. Ruffer bought the Zubaráns from the Church Commissioners, which was intending to sell them off. As well as restoring the castle he is regenerating the adjacent marketplace, where a miners’ art gallery and a 29-metre viewing tower were opened last year. A Spanish art gallery, in homage to Zubarán, is planned and the market square’s pubs have been bought and closed, before conversion into hotels and restaurants. Ruffer has also funded the annual Kynren, an outdoor pageant chronicling 2,000 years of English history.The tower, in particular, has been greeted with bemusement by some. But in the Fifteas Vintage Tearoom, in the market square, John Phelan is happy to sing Ruffer’s praises. Phelan is a local historian who lives in the nearby village of Howden-le-Wear, which is in the neighbouring constituency of North West Durham. “It’s very exciting,” Phelan says. “He’s turning Bishop Auckland into a place of culture. One to rival Durham even. History might be the new thing to bring some hope and a feeling of community back to Bishop.”A sense of renewal is desperately required, Phelan adds. “You’d like to think as life went on things would get better, but they’ve not.”An inveterate romantic, this year Phelan is sending out Christmas cards which carry a photograph of the FA Amateur Cup final in 1954, when ‘Bishop’ played local rivals, Crook Town, in front of a Wembley crowd of 100,000. His father took him, aged four, to the match on a train that went directly from Crook to London. But the nostalgia comes with a sharp edge. Echoing a theme that comes up continually in the area, a lack of public transport, Phelan says: “A lack of funding from central government has knocked County Durham back generally. The buses have been cut and you barely get any after 6pm. That impacts on people’s lives. There are villages that are practically cut off in the evening now, for people who don’t drive.“The cuts to street-lighting have meant that rural areas are pitch black at night. I know a woman who is frightened to walk her dogs because it gets so dark. Austerity has chipped away at the quality of life of communities.”Phelan will vote Labour but is not holding out too much hope. “I won’t be surprised if the Conservatives tip it their way this time. The Labour vote isn’t as loyal as it once was and some people are not so keen on Helen Goodman.“I tell people who are thinking of voting Conservative, ‘You’re shooting yourself in the foot. Look at the cuts. The Conservative governments haven’t done anything for this area.’ But the Brexit issue has been very bad. If I’d have voted for Brexit I’d be angry with Labour. They’ve dillied and dallied on it. It’s been weak. A Labour leader should have said: ‘People have voted to leave and that’s it whether you like it or not.”Whether that would have won the vote of Ryan Lamb, a 23-year-old labourer from Spennymoor, is doubtful. Lamb voted leave in 2016 and Tory in the general election a year later. He intends to do so again this time round, though he has no faith in the pledges being made on either side of the political spectrum.Andrew Smith is an 80-year-old former NUM activist who worked at the Mainsforth and Ferryhill pits. He now volunteers at Spennymoor’s mining museum, sometimes assisted byErnie Foster, 81, who was also active in the union. The small museum is an affecting cornucopia of mining memorabilia: there are banners of course, but also detonators, cables and a trophy awarded at the Spennymoor gala pit pony competition in 1956.Smith views the forthcoming election, and the fraying of loyalty to Labour, with sadness and trepidation. “It makes you angry,” he says. “It makes you frustrated that people who have gone through the times that you went through, are thinking like this. It’s not just the young. It takes a lot to get through to people to explain what the real problems are. The media don’t help with their bias people say they don’t like Corbyn. But when you ask them they don’t really know why.”A December election is not ideal for octogenarian activists: “We’d like to get out leafleting for Labour,” says Smith. “But we’re getting on now.” Foster chips in: “The main thing is that we can’t have that lot in round here – the Tories. That can’t be allowed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5361ba663ebac8d63c15d19f2020f2076b537f86/0_99_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccc127d15f56100d873cc58658f80c77","title":"food bank northampton people abandoned by state","story":"My first session comes at a busy time of the year as staff gear up for Christmas. Each person who comes through the door is offered a hot drink and some toast while they tell volunteers their reasons for being there. A teacher has turned up to ask for a package for a young boy’s family. He arrived at school three days in a row without having had breakfast. When she called the child’s parents, she says his mother broke down in tears saying, “I can’t afford to feed my children.” A woman comes in and says she has recently been moved on to universal credit. She received her last payment from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in mid-November and has been told not to expect anything else until 12 January. She doesn’t know how she will get through the festive period.The closer we get to Christmas, the busier it gets. The food bank is only open on a Wednesday morning and at least 10 volunteers turn up every week to help the three part-time staff. During one session a small boy of about five approaches me and asks quietly if there is any turkey so that he can have a Christmas dinner. Amid all the desperation, there are moments of light. The food bank will be closed from Christmas Eve until the new year but on one of the last days of opening , a man and his son turn up with bags full of food and toiletries. Their family decided to donate to the food bank rather than buying presents for each other. Most donations come from iniduals so there are times when supplies run low, especially of particular items such astoilet rolls, nappies and longlife milk.Number of parcels issued: 190Staff thought that things would quieten down after Christmas but the impact of universal credit is starting to be felt and it has become normal for a long queue of people to be waiting outside before the doors open at 10am. In just one morning I speak to four people who have been movedfrom employment support allowance to universal credit. They’ve all been forced to rely on food handouts during the wait for their first payment. One woman says that she needs to attend a hospital appointment but can’t afford the bus fare so will not be going. A man in insecure work has rent arrears that he previously paid £5 a week towards clearing. After being moved to universal credit, he now has to pay £127 a month. He has a serious lung condition and high blood pressure but says he regularly goes without gas and electricity for much of the month. “I top it up once, then when it runs out I just sit in my coat.”Number of parcels issued: 171A woman and her four-year-old child arrive at the Emmanuel church, where the food bank is held. They arrived the day before and were given a hot meal at the community cafe that is run from the same building and told to return for an emergency food package. After a run of bad luck, they have ended up sleeping in a car. She says it was so cold one night that there was ice on the inside of the window when they woke up. Volunteers signpost them to various support services and tell them to keep returning until the situation is resolved. People have started to hear about universal credit advance payments but many are too scared to take one. There is a lot of confusion over how much needs to be paid back and when.Number of parcels issued: 174 Things continue to be busy. Volunteers say that last year it was normal to see around 20 people each week, now sometimes more than 40 parcels are handed out during a single session. A man has travelled six miles by bike. He’ll have to make the same journey back with six heavy bags full of tins, jars and other food. He doesn’t complain, he says he is just grateful for the help.A pregnant woman has been forced to use the food bank for the first time after being moved on to universal credit. She says she “hasn’t done much eating lately” and has been in hospital with malnutrition following a stomach bug. Her rent is high and there is a list of problems with her home that she is trying to get sorted. She is worried about her children and the new baby and says that feeding them comes before feeding herself.Another family made their universal credit claim on 14 February and have been told they will not get the first payment until the beginning of April.Number of parcels issued: 177 Many of the people who use the food bank are middle-aged or younger, but one day three pensioners come in during a single session. One of them, a 69-year-old man, is almost in tears as he says he is using his life savings to pay his rent because of a housing benefit mistake. Despite being of pension age he still works but has recently lost his job and this is the first time he’s used a food bank. As we talk, I can hear his voice breaking. He apologises and quickly leaves with his bags.A man comes in almost completely doubled over and walking with a stick. Despite a string of health conditions, he has been told he is fit for work. He has to get two buses home and staff are concerned about how he will manage with all his bags of food. He’s helped down to the bus stop but from there he is alone. The volunteers work incredibly hard. It can be both physically and emotionally tiring. When they are not moving heavy boxes and bags, they are listening to people in crisis. It’s clear that for some people having somebody to talk to is almost as important as the food they are collecting.Number of parcels issued: 173A woman who works 30 hours a week was moved on to universal credit from tax credits in March. She still hasn’t had her first payment but has received an advance. She decided to use this to cover some of her rent because she was under pressure from her landlord – now there is nothing left. She’s come to the food bank with her manager from work because she needs some support.She says she’s never been in such a bad position, even when she was unemployed. “The bills are adding up and I’ve been charged by the bank for unpaid direct debits. I broke down yesterday because I’m just so embarrassed by it all.” Number of parcels issued: 170 A young mother comes in who waited the standard five weeks for her first universal credit payment but, when she received it, it was £120 less than she’d been told. She’s been without electricity for a week and is having to walk to a friend’s house to do her cooking every day.So many people here have spent years living on the edge of poverty, just managing to survive. Often it’s only a minor change to their circumstances that pushes them over the edge. They then face a huge battle to get back to where they were before.Number of parcels issued: 118Many of the parents are starting to worry about the summer holidays. Before they even think about the cost of entertaining their children for six long weeks, there is the matter of feeding them. Most rely on free school lunches for the one hot meal their children will receive each day.The woman who came in earlier in the year because she was sleeping in a car with her daughter is now working part time and renting a small house. She has just received her first universal credit payment and used some of it to buy a trolley-load of donations for the food bank.Number of parcels issued: 184It’s the summer holidays and as well as helping out at the food bank, some staff are running local lunch clubs. They provide a meal for the whole family and lots of activities for the children. The groups are run separately from the food bank and because they do not open every day the families in urgent need still come here.Some people are worried about the cost of school uniforms and shoes, especially those who have children moving up to secondary school. One woman is upset because she’d managed to buy everything her daughter needed but her PE bag has just broken and she doesn’t have the money to replace it. After speaking to her, a volunteer quickly pops out and buys one to give to her.Number of parcels issued: 137There is nowhere near enough recognition for the amazing work the staff and volunteers of food banks do. I’ve been coming here for more than nine months now and I’ve seen the dedication and care that goes into offering the type of support the staff provide. They have stepped in where the state has failed. The number of people coming in has fluctuated over the last few months. Nobody can say for definite why – but it’s still not unusual for people to be queueing to get in. One morning I arrive half an hour before opening and there are already two women with small babies and another in a wheelchair waiting outside.Number of parcels issued: 140 A lot of people who come in have debt problems. One man, who was previously street homeless, is terrified about losing his home because of unpaid bills. He would usually be referred to the national debt charity, CAP, but food bank staff have been told they are not taking any new clients until February next year because they are so busy. A local debt service is also unable to take on anyone new at the moment. Another asks if they can call him later in the week to talk through his options but as he doesn’t have a phone that’s not possible. After a volunteer spends an hour calling around different places, a home visit is finally arranged for him.Being able to signpost people to other services is vital but in Northamptonshire, like other areas, many organisations are facing cuts to funding. To help meet the need, monthly advice clinics are held at the food bank by a community law group, the local Labour party candidate, Sally Keeble, and a mental health charity. There is always a queue of people waiting for their help.Number of parcels issued: 165 A recent Trussell Trust report  shows that two-thirds of people who have used a food bank have had problems with the benefit system in the last year. This comes as no surprise to people here. It’s been clear to me in the time that I have been coming that, alongside low pay, benefit issues are the leading cause for people needing food handouts.A woman with MS, osteoarthritis and mental health problems comes in happily waving a letter in her hand. She saw her money drop significantly when she was moved from disability living allowance to personal independence payments and waited more than 30 weeks for her appeal against this to be heard at a tribunal. During that time she has regularly received emergency food and sanitary products. She’s just found out that her case was successful and wants to show staff the decision from the court.A social worker comes in to collect a parcel for a man with mental health problems. She says that he hasn’t eaten properly for four days and has been scavenging through bins to feed himself.Number of parcels issued: 131Tesco has held a food bank collection in its local store. It’s a huge help at this time of year when supplies can run low but it also means a lot of extra work for the volunteers. They worked out a rota so that there were always representatives at the supermarket to thank people for their donations. Others helped to transport and sort through the boxes of goods received.Piles of advent calendars are ready to be handed out and boxes of mince pies and chocolates are stacked high. Staff and volunteers have collected small gifts to give out and people can help themselves to wrapping paper, sellotape and cards.The general election is just over a week away and despite Labour’s pledges to tackle food poverty there has been very little national debate on the issue. Northampton is not a particularly deprived town yet almost 14,000 children are living in poverty here. There was much talk after the EU referendum about the people “left behind” but the people I’ve met at the food bank over the last year haven’t simply been left behind, they’ve been abandoned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0231bf6a8177b1ed6821bfe2b32665cc8ee8757c/0_222_3879_2329/master/3879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78baffb9d9078247eaf01d8a2a1697d5","title":"unnecessary appendix surgery performed on thousands in uk","story":"Third of women who enter theatre end up having normal appendix removed, study findsThousands of people in the UK, particularly young women, are having their appendices removed unnecessarily because of inadequacies in the way appendicitis is diagnosed, surgeons say.Appendicectomies are the UK’s most common emergency operation the team behind the research estimate there are about 80,000 hospital admissions a year for suspected appendicitis in people aged 16 to 45. However, the study suggests, about 5,500 people a year have a normal appendix removed.Aneel Bhangu, of the University of Birmingham, a consultant surgeon and co-author of the study, said: “This is a situation where change can be brought about that will save the NHS potentially millions of pounds a year.”The team say that, unlike the US and some countries in continental Europe, hospitals in the UK do not typically use CT scans to check for appendicitis, although practices differ greatly between hospitals.The upshot, they say, is that many patients undergo unnecessary surgery – an expensive process that brings the risk of complications.Prof Neil Mortensen, the vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons, defended the status quo, saying serious complications from removing an appendix were rare, but “missing a case of appendicitis is potentially life-threatening and it can also result in infertility in females”.Writing in the British Journal of Surgery, Bhangu and his colleagues report how they asked surgeons in 154 hospitals across the UK to record data from patients aged 16-45 who were admitted with suspected appendicitis over a two-week period during mid-2017.In total 5,345 patients were admitted, two-thirds of whom were women. Just 32 patients were given a risk score based on their symptoms and blood tests to assess their risk of actually having appendicitis.Bhangu said women were more likely to be admitted with suspected appendicitis, and to have a normal appendix removed, in part because period pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts and other conditions can all cause pain that may initially be mistaken for appendicitis.The authors say CT imaging has been avoided in the past in the UK, at least in part because of concerns about exposing patients to radiation. However the team say modern scans use low doses and suggest their introduction should be considered.“It is the same radiation as flying to New York, so we need to start using them,” said Bhangu, adding that the costs of the scan would be more than covered by avoiding unnecessary hospital stays and operations.The team says applying risk scores, followed by a CT scan could reduce the numbers of patients who have unnecessary appendicectomies.Mortensen said ruling out gynaecological conditions in women could be difficult. “Good quality pelvic ultrasound imaging can be difficult to obtain out-of-hours, and low-dose CT is not widely used,” he said, noting both the radiation risk and shortage of radiologists. He also defended the removal of a normal appendix when found during surgery.“This is standard practice which is not harmful to the patient and protects them from a possible future appendicitis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f40441f93158b9e5cb5df740ae87753e879c3408/0_175_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22e54dca9fc11fe22311aa2803e8dffd","title":"anthony joshua andy ruiz jr saudi arabia heavyweight boxing trilogy","story":"• Joshua says he will have third fight with Mexican-American• British boxer looks lighter and slimmer for Saturday’s boutAnthony Joshua gave little away about his new slimline physique or his tactics to defeat Andy Ruiz Jr in their rematch in the briefest of public workouts in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. He was, however, happy to advertise his powers of prophecy, predicting a trilogy with the Mexican-American whatever the result of the fight on Saturday.After barely a minute of shadowboxing in a ring in front of a huge government complex in Riyadh, Joshua said Ruiz had been on his mind since he stepped in as a late replacement to meet him in June – and would continue to be whatever the result of their WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight title fight in Diriyah.“This isn’t the last time I will be seeing Andy Ruiz in the ring,” Joshua said. “I think we make for good fights. I think there is going to be a knockout on Saturday and that is what people want to see, bloodshed and knockouts. And we’ll definitely see each other the third time.”Joshua, 30, looked relaxed and lean but denied he was deliberately looking for more speed. “I am quick anyway. I am not looking for anything except the win. That’s the objective. It’s not about speed. It’s like night and day. I shed some skin last time. Rebuilt myself. The objective is just about to win, win, win.”As he left the stage, Joshua posed for selfies with a delighted crowd of local supporters and also stopped briefly to speak to Dillian Whyte, his fellow heavyweight who is also on the bill against Mariusz Wach.“Bring it back, yeah?” Whyte told him, to which Joshua replied: “We are going to go hard, trust me.”As they spoke Ruiz was in the ring, looking fast and sharp as he went through three rounds on the pads. Meanwhile Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, told the  that the British fighter will come in more than half a stone lighter than his first fight against Ruiz having spent much less time lifting weights.“I don’t like talking about weight because last time I said he would be at his lightest ever and he came in at his heaviest ever,” he said. “But you will see something.“He was 17st 10lb in the first fight but he’s much, much lighter now. I think he’ll weigh around 17st 2lb. He’s not been pumping weights, he’s been watching his diet, eating really clean. This camp has been 15 or 16 weeks not 10 or 11 as normal. He’s been sparring, sparring, sparring.”Hearn added: “He looks great, he feels great and he is lean, lean. He has cut out a lot of strength and conditioning work and this camp has been boxing related. He is boxing fit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144481d168c1944af1eac4afd436f0828da4ff37/0_115_4318_2591/master/4318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a97d47dfdf06223eb615ae2baea76a4","title":"england new zealand series joe root cricket","story":"For the second time in less than two years England’s Test team leave New Zealand with a 1-0 series defeat to show for their efforts a hammering in the first outing and a slightly improved follow-up performance that still ended with a draw and handshakes.That said, while only 41 overs were bowled on a soggy final day, one that typically brightened up once the umpires had called things off, this still felt a flatter finish from Joe Root’s beaten tourists than the thwarted late surge in Christchurch last year.Talk of afternoon rain and the 22 yards of flat, scarcely diminished middle earth meant it was nigh-on impossible to force anything but the stalemate. That didn’t mean the tourists could simply see out the match waiting for the heavens to open. Root will have wanted to sign off the start of this supposed new era with one last push.Yet in a tour of many impotent periods in the field there was one final wicketless outing, during which came a particularly sorry loss of focus when Joe Denly dropped Kane Williamson on 62, en route to Test century No 21. It had onlookers instantly trying to work out if this was the worst they had ever seen, with Mike Gatting’s bungled effort off Kiran More in Madras 26 years ago the most cited challenger here.Root looked nonplussed at the time and then later tried to laugh it off at the press conference, describing this looping chance at short midwicket, chiselled out by a fine bit of knuckle-ball trickery by Jofra Archer, as a “one-off goober” that Denly would be reminded of for some time. The only comfort came through its lack of consequence.But then it also summed up elements of their downfall, not least with Archer the bowler denied this prized scalp during a promising final burst on a tour that has otherwise been an eye-opening first overseas assignment. It has also been one that, statistically, ranks as England’s least threatening in history by way of collective output.They took a wicket every 115.7 balls sent down which, according to the number-crunching statistician Andy Zaltzman, beat a previous worst strike-rate of 114.5 during the six-Test 1989 Ashes. An average of 56 runs per breakthrough was only mildly better.These were, it must be said, two grim flat pitches that many felt did the sport few favours by way of a spectacle. But then the seemingly indefatigable Neil Wagner still found a way, bending his back for 13 wickets at 19.84 runs apiece.Yet the Kookaburra ball remained kryptonite in English hands for long periods. Stuart Broad played the old pro, keeping the runs down and picking his moments, while Sam Curran and Ben Stokes never lacked for perspiration. The main plus came from Chris Woakes in the second Test, a seamer who came in cold by way of warm-up time and delivered the kind of overseas showing many thought beyond him.Denly’s blooper wasn’t the only drop on the last day to cause their collective final strike-rate. Williamson’s first life in the morning came on 39 when Ben Stokes, whose effort was commendable given a dicky knee, fired one into the New Zealand captain’s ribs. It took the glove, only for Ollie Pope to show up his emergency wicketkeeper role for the selectorial carelessness it was by grassing a ing yet regulation pouch down leg.Neither chance was as costly as the one put down at slip by Stokes in Mount Maunganui, when BJ Watling turned 31 into an ultimately series‑winning double century. Williamson and Ross Taylor, who brought up his 19th Test century moments before the rain by sweeping two fours and a six off Root, were not playing a couple of match-defining innings on the final day.Nevertheless, they were the fourth and fifth New Zealand batsmen to make centuries across the two Tests – Tom Latham and Mitch Santner the others – compared to England’s two. Root’s double century was a bloody-minded return to the runs column and timely as regards the swirling debate over his captaincy, while Rory Burns will hopefully grow in confidence from his second at Test level.These came a Test too late, however, the defeat at Bay Oval having consigned England to their first year without a series win since 1999 and thanks to a sub-par 353 all out of three unconverted half‑centuries from Burns, Denly and Stokes.While England keep talking about the Ashes in 2021-22, New Zealand now fly to Perth this Saturday for a three-match series in Australia. This talented, humble and coherent Black Caps team – possibly their best – will still be underdogs, though.

At the same time, it also highlighted how much work Root’s men have to do if they are to get theirs nearly as sharp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1544ff26cc4f48a0f46c8994ae5dca158ae8bdcb/0_46_2916_1751/master/2916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e9da23326867c399a55de0759557c39","title":"israel folau and rugby australia settle unfair dismissal claim over social media post","story":"Former Wallabies star had sought $14m in compensation saying he was wrongfully dismissed over anti-gay Instagram post The long-running legal dispute between Rugby Australia and Israel Folau has ended with a settlement reached over the former Wallaby’s sacking in the wake of an anti-gay social media post in April.RA apologised to Folau in a joint statement issued on Wednesday that draws a line under the bitter affair, although the exact terms of the settlement will remain confidential.The parties have been involved in mediation this week over Folau’s $14m compensation claim after the former rugby league and AFL player claimed his dismissal by RA and Rugby NSW was unfair, following his post on Instagram that hell awaits “drunks, homosexuals, adulterers” and others.A statement from RA, RNSW and Folau said the post reflected Folau’s “genuinely held religious beliefs” and that he “did not intend to harm or offend any person when he uploaded the post”.“Mr Folau wants all Australians to know that he does not condone discrimination of any kind against any person on the grounds of their sexuality and that he shares Rugby Australia’s commitment to inclusiveness and ersity,” the statement read.RA said it did not agree with the content of Folau’s post, before each party wished the other well for the future. “Inclusiveness is one of rugby’s core values and it welcomes all people to the game, including all members of the LGBTI community,” the statement continued.“While it was not Rugby Australia’s intention, Rugby Australia acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused to the Folaus. Similarly, Mr Folau did not intend to hurt or harm the game of rugby and acknowledges and apologises for any hurt or harm caused.”Folau’s four-year, $4m contract was ripped up in May, after an independent panel hearing found his social media post to have breached the terms of his employment, effectively ending his rugby union career in Australia.The 30-year-old had argued “no Australian of any faith should be fired for practising religion” and sought “substantial remedies” from his former employers. His initial claim of $10m was increased to $14m last week.On Monday the chief executive of Rugby Australia, Raelene Castle, claimed Folau had admitted his comments caused harm but would not hold back from posting whatever he liked.Folau has continued to court controversy since his sacking, most recently attracting criticism for comments he made during a church sermon when he implied the devastating bush fires on Australia’s east coast were God’s punishment for legalising same-sex marriage and abortion.News of Wednesday’s settlement was welcomed by Equality Australia, who said it put an end to a “isive and hurtful period for LGBTIQ+ people in rugby, in sport and more generally”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fca704031fd4e5099105e3d81fa769af27e4965/0_75_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=099737fc3fbf06155853aa0418aa17d8","title":"choose your favourite stage show of 2019","story":"Tell us about your standout stage show of the year – we’ll feature a selection of your favourites later this monthWhat was your favourite theatre, comedy or dance show of the year?

As artistic director of France’s biggest dramatic arts centre, Nanterre-Amandiers, since 2014, he has drawn ever-larger, ever-younger audiences for shows by artists such as Claude Régy, Joël Pommerat, Jérôme Bel and Milo Rau, all eked from a tiny 1.4m euro (£1.19m) annual production budget. His own work is feted around the world, except – astonishingly – in Britain. This autumn he pulled off the tour de force of hosting Jean-Luc Godard, who invested every nook and cranny of the dank, rickety Nanterre theatre building with myriad screenings of his major and minor works since the 1980s. You could see Woody Allen as the fool in King Lear in the theatre’s costume workshop, or outtakes of Patti Smith – on board the doomed Costa Concordia – in one of its corridors. Godard preferred this environment over the Pompidou Centre, which had offered him carte blanche.Nanterre is not an isolated case: another Greater Paris mayor recently had the respected and buzzing Mains d’Oeuvres arts centre in Saint Ouen evacuated by the police. This followed the withdrawal of the town’s 90,000-euro annual subsidy in 2014, a move which fatally unbalanced the already fire-damaged centre. Greater Paris – attempting to construct a true metropolitan identity from 130 municipalities – seems destined to falter if its existing bright spots are allowed to be dimmed in this way. The central government has reacted late or not at all in these cases, and is in retreat in general in the arts, formerly a bastion of French identity and politics. Theatre-loving Emmanuel Macron risks appearing withdrawn and Hamlet-like as things decline around him.Irina Brook threw in the towel at the Théâtre National de Nice at about the same time as Quesne, after valiant efforts to make the live arts more inclusive and engaged. For Brook, it became clear that her desire for a responsible creative agenda – especially regarding the climate crisis – was incompatible with the constraints imposed by multiple funding bodies. Does this forebode a fall from grace of France’s much-envied cultural sector? Are artist-directors about to become obsolete, like the post-extinction, birdless scarecrows populating Quesne’s last show, Farm Fatale?Quesne’s own directorial work is all about how we form institutions, with cowboys trying to found a museum of sublime landscape paintings (Caspar Western Friedrich), heavy rockers trying to make their own snowbound theme park (La Mélancolie des Dragons) and the survivors of a plane crash creating a new world on a polystyrene tropical island (Crash Park). In the darkly hilarious Night of the Moles, a group of seven moles set about procreating, gorging on giant worms, wordlessly recounting Plato’s cave parable and – as in all his shows – making music. The moles were so good that they now tour as an underground, post-human grunge group named Maulwürfe.These characters’ attempts to cope and evolve are – by definition – non-dramatic, sometimes boring, often a bit pathetic, and always extremely funny. Quesne stages kindliness and cooperation, often against the backdrop of an exterior, unspecified threat. The scenery (which he designs) shapeshifts between cheap-fake and sublime. If his work lacks heroes, villains (and even stories), this is he says because “within the Anthropocene we have now entered the Fictionocene, the era of twisted reality where our supposed leaders are far more grotesque and untruthful than anything we could imagine on a stage.”The lurking offstage menace is – of course – ecological collapse, the destabilising force behind many current political ills. Quesne’s first act as Nanterre director was to organise (with philosopher Bruno Latour and theatre director Frédérique Aït-Touati) a vast pre-enactment of the 2015 Paris climate conference, a serious-play summit in which students from around the world represented the conflicting interests of nation-states, indigenous peoples and non-human entities (soil, seas, rivers). Locked in the theatre for three days, while an audience observed them and took part in further debates, they produced a real protocol that was delivered to the president of the COP 21 climate change conference.Philippe Quesne’s physical legacy in Nanterre might in the endonly amount to the modest garden path he made to link the theatre’s green surrounds to a local park and metro, a vital trail through the disjointed thinking of the Paris metropolis. “It’s funny,” he remarks, “but at the end of Farm Fatale the scarecrows took their greatest treasure – their pulsating eggs, containing the future hope of nature – off stage on a kind of ark. Maybe I, too, will just disappear up the garden path with my actors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ce255ed0a74f750374b6ed778937a065e8775c/0_233_7106_4265/master/7106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c72e80721c58b57e30e7bbf9e40c25a1","title":"fairview jackie sibblies drury nadia latif","story":"Jackie Sibblies Drury thinks her acclaimed play, and the stereotypes it presents, will soon go out of date. As it comes to the Young Vic, she and director Nadia Latif explain whyPlaywright Jackie Sibblies Drury and director Nadia Latif are about to open Fairview at the Young Vic. I’ve just told them I know next to nothing about Sibblies Drury’s Pulitzer prizewinner, and their smiles mirror each other. Latif nods and says one word: “Great!”I think I know three things about Fairview: it revolves around a black American family, there’s some exploration of class, or specifically, the black middle class, and there’s something to do with surveillance. Is that correct? What else can I know about the play? Sibblies Drury smiles. “It takes place in a theatre. And there’s going to be an audience.” Latif interjects: “Hopefully! And there’s a set.” “There’s totally a set.” The two laugh again.But the silence, says Sibblies Drury, is “not for plot reasons. It’s not like you find out that someone was dead the whole time. I think that it’s more allowing oneself the ability to have your own experience watching something. The way that people process things is a really inidual thing, and experience is inidual in terms of your upbringing, in terms of your class, in terms of your race, in terms of the people that you’ve been friends with, the books that you’ve read, your references.”Latif agrees. “Theatre is not film, or TV, or Netflix. It’s a live art form. If you come to this show, knowing too much about it, you’re not having a live experience. You’ve in some way already processed what it’s about. So I think there’s something about encouraging you to have a live experience from minute zero to minute 100. Just come and have a collective, communal life experience, and then at the end, you can process it.”Latif herself did not watch Fairvew before agreeing to direct it. She and Kwame Kwei-Armah, artistic director of the Young Vic, were looking for plays. “He went to New York and called me on his way back, like, ‘I’ve just seen this play, and you need to have read it by the time I land.’ I really strongly didn’t want to do an African-American play, because I was conscious I’d done quite a number of them. I wanted to find something that felt close to me. But then I read it and was like, ‘Oh, but it is!’ I think it reaches beyond an African-American experience towards a black experience, or an ‘othered’ experience.”At the time, the off-Broadway production of Fairview gained a lot of buzz. But since then Fairview has shifted from “well-received” to “most recent winner of the Pulitzer prize for drama”. “Every play that I’ve ever done has sort of been about managing people’s disappointments in a way where they don’t feel disappointed at the end,” Sibblies Drury says. “That feels particularly true of this. Because I feel some people are going to come in and be like, ‘Oh, this has won a fancy award. This must be a fancy experience.’ And they’re going to come and be like, ‘What?’”Latif says that the play’s ideas are so complex that “in a way, the fourth act is what happens to you afterwards. How you process it. And I’m totally happy for there to be intellectual backlash. That’s cool, because that’s a conversation. I’m terrified of things that are universally lauded, I feel like that’s a full stop.”For now, keeping information about Fairview to a minimum is possible. But at some point, just like Death of a Salesman or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, the Pulitzer-winning title will mean more, and more people will find out about the play’s plot. Can Sibblies Drury imagine Fairview being produced regularly, for decades to come? She pauses. “No. I hope not. I think it’s a hard play to do well. Also to me, it feels like its shelf life isn’t going to be very long. Hopefully, because of society. I do hope that part of the charm of the show is that it sort of puts together all of these stereotypes that are so ingrained into our consciousness that we like barely register them as that any more. And so hopefully pointing out those stereotypes won’t feel fresh or interesting or new relatively soon. But maybe that’s optimistic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dfbd95ba98bc42f8e95dc5749e18177dcd4c202/0_0_2892_1735/master/2892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7677d54a78619ada3ac27d88fc84bfdd","title":"larry page google alphabet resign sundar pichai","story":"Current Google CEO will also manage Alphabet under one role in bid to ‘simplify management structure’Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are stepping down from their positions at the parent company Alphabet, leaving Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, to manage both Alphabet and Google under one role.Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was created through corporate restructuring in October 2015 to manage ventures outside its main search businesses, known in the company as “other bets”. Page was Alphabet’s CEO, while Brin was its president.Alphabet has since become “well established”, Page and Brin wrote in a blogpost announcing the change. The executives wrote that it was time for the companies to “simplify management structure”.“We’ve never been ones to hold on to management roles when we think there’s a better way to run the company,” they said in the post. “And Alphabet and Google no longer need two CEOs and a president.”Pichai has been leading Google for more than four years. The company has nearly doubled its headcount since he took over, growing from 59,000 employees to 114,000.Alphabet had been positioning Pichai as the de facto leader for quite some time, making him the top executive voice at shareholder meetings, on earnings call and as a spokesman at congressional hearings.Page and Brin had stopped making appearances at weekly question-and-answer sessions with employees, and Page did not attend this summer’s Alphabet shareholder meeting.“Today, in 2019, if the company was a person, it would be a young adult of 21 and it would be time to leave the roost,” they said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165ca1bff40e13c1fd5c1fac37c3f4b216429b55/821_615_2963_1778/master/2963.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3423ee09e3436b982ae51963fa23df06","title":"send tip hidden uk gem win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Whether it’s an unsung museum, pub or shop, a great little place round the corner or somewhere you stumbled upon on your travels, we want you to unearth your hidden gemNext week’s  Travel section will be dedicated to hidden UK gems – and we want to include some of your recommendations in our roundup.

Through no fault of Emily Maitlis’, Prince Andrew outed himself as such a lunk-headed idiot that the serious allegations against him retreated a little.When you think of that interview, you immediately think of Andrew’s volley of jaw-dropping explanations. His inability to sweat. His photographic memory of Woking Pizza Express. His tendency to be “too honourable”. You were watching a man who spent his life being held accountable for nothing attempt to skirt an important issue with the power of his bovine privilege alone, and failing hard. The interview became less about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and more about watching a man drive his own life off a cliff.And while the interview certainly had impact – it isn’t every day someone does so badly at Newsnight their mum fires them from their own family – it did mean the focus shifted away from the women at the centre of the allegations. Last night’s Panorama was a much-needed corrective.There was nothing flashy about The Prince and the Epstein Scandal. There were no stand-out lines, and no memes will come of it, but Virginia Giuffre managed to be everything Prince Andrew wasn’t. She was thorough where Andrew was evasive. She was determined where Andrew panicked. She sat with the weight of her accusations where Andrew ignored them. Her proximity to Epstein left her with nothing. Andrew’s left him with everything to lose. More than anything, Giuffre looked like a person a real, flesh and blood person who had spent at least some of her life dealing with the consequences of something. She was Andrew’s opposite in every way.This was a much more muted hour of television than Newsnight. Newsnight let Prince Andrew tie his own shoelaces together and watched him fall, but this is what made sure he’ll never get up again. Facts and inconsistencies were fastidiously laid out one after the other. Different voices – victims, lawyers, former heads of royal protection – were piled up until the severity of the accusations against Andrew became undeniable. This isn’t something he can slink away from any more. This isn’t going to go anywhere.Smartly, Panorama also used Andrew’s interview in key moments, just to highlight its utter stupidity. The emotional climax of the episode came at the halfway point. Giuffre described what it was like to be abused by a member of the royal family – where it happened, how long it lasted, what it felt like, her subsequent feelings of powerless and shame – before breaking down when she attempted to understand it. “I couldn’t comprehend how the highest levels of the government and powerful people were allowing this to happen,” she wept. “Not only allowing it to happen but participating in it.” Her anguish was perfectly evident. Cut to Andrew on Newsnight, eyes darting around beneath his sheen of privilege, telling Maitlis that “I can absolutely, categorically tell you it never happened.”Although it aired afterwards, Giuffre was interviewed for Panorama before Prince Andrew’s Newsnight episode was recorded. Perhaps that’s for the best now she must be taken seriously. The lasting impression of Giuffre was her immense bravery in facing such towering institutions alone. The sheer strength she possesses is incredible. Forget Prince Andrew when the dust settles on this, she’s the one who deserves to be remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f79a2a32718508e994bcb76cbd32de0dafdcc6ea/0_195_4950_2970/master/4950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c0340b499eb37336f927cfbcbe24bbd","title":"abby mcenany when guys dream of lesbians theyre not thinking of me","story":"The comic’s buzzy, semi-autobiographical TV show Work in Progress is also her first time on a TV set and at the age of 51, she calls it a fairytale come trueThe opening scene of new comedy series Work in Progress sees Abby McEnany trying to bring back “wassup”. The second sees her announcing her potentially imminent suicide to her therapist: “I’m gonna kill myself in 180 days, if things don’t get better.”Work in Progress is not only McEnany’s first TV series but it’s the first time she’s been on a professional set. And with this original, melancholic comedy, she is setting the bar high. Its autobiographical traits – McEnany plays “Abby”, and is a self-described “fat, queer dyke” – are nothing compared with its origins story, which is something out of a fairytale.“That’s funny, because I often say that it’s like a fairytale. It is legitimately my dream come true,” says McEnany, calling from her Chicago apartment. At 51, she is the star, co-creator and co-writer of Work in Progress, which is quite the first TV gig. She is out of coffee, and warns me that some may be delivered as we speak. “I’m so embarrassed, dude! What an asshole move.” Clearly, success has gone to her head. “I mean honestly,” she laughs. “What a bougie bitch!”McEnany moved to Chicago for college in 1986, and has been a mainstay of the city’s improv and sketch comedy scene for years, eventually joining Second City’s touring company when she was 40. Three years ago, she started a form of live storytelling at the iO Theatre, performing material she had written about her life. She called it Work in Progress. Her friend and co-creator Tim Mason was looking for material to direct, to build up his directing portfolio, saw the show, and suggested they work together on bringing it to screen.“That’s what I’d always wanted to do. I’m better at working with people. It helps me not get anxious. All that negative talk, that fatalism, that defeatism, is so easy when you’re by yourself. Hold on.” The coffee arrives. “I’m such a jerk! Anyway. I’ve always wanted to do it, because I think there are not a lot of people like me in film or on TV.” She does believe there are more and more different kinds of women on screen. She loves Orange Is the New Black, for example. “You see fat women and old women and queer women and butch women. That’s who I am, right? Old, fat, butch, grey-haired. I’m not trying to say I’m the only one. But I would say, there are not a lot.”Before Work In Progress became a series, she would go to auditions (she says she was “horrible” at it), but never booked a job. “They’re not like, you can play a mom and sell fast food. They don’t want to show fat people eating burgers. And that’s in commercials. In TV shows, there’s not a ton of people that are not the palatable people that America wants to look at.” She mentions a joke she has with her friends. “When guys dream of lesbians, they’re not thinking of me,” she laughs. The solution to her “abysmal” history of auditioning turned out to be right there in front of her. “That’s why I thought, I’ve got to write for myself.”McEnany and Mason were considering turning their idea into a web series, but the pilot they had put together caused waves at Sundance in 2018 it was picked up for a full series by Showtime, and The Matrix co-creator Lilly Wachowski, whom McEnany had known for a few years, effectively came out of retirement to produce and co-write. The pieces had all fallen into place. “Sometimes Tim and I will be like, how did this happen?” she says. “To have this amazing opportunity at 51 years old is just beautiful. I can’t believe it.”Then again, she reasons, it takes her time to build up the confidence in whatever it is she is doing. “When I had my first real relationship, I was 29.” She auditioned for Second City’s touring company for 10 years before she got in. “It’s just one of those things. I believe this wouldn’t have happened in my 20s. It wouldn’t have happened in my 40s.” Much of the story of Work in Progress is about Abby, the character, finding opportunities to live, when she has just about given up hope. “I think the story is really based on my life.”What everybody wants to know, of course, is how much of it is true. “Now, my answer is, it depends what time of day it is, and who’s asking,” McEnany laughs. “Everyone has terrible moments, I’m a human being, but I hope I’m not as terrible.”Instead, the truth comes from what she calls the “messiness” of Abby. “I have mental illness, I struggle with a bunch of stuff, I try to be an honest person and open, but it’s scary. The character’s been beaten down and has sworn off relationships and is struggling. I’ve had times in my life where I’m so depressed and stuck.” Her parents first took her to therapy when she was in eighth grade. “I had my first panic attack at five, and you don’t have the words at five. When I started exhibiting OCD, it wasn’t really in the lexicon like it is now. I was able to talk to my parents and they had the means for me to try therapy.” She considers herself lucky that they were able to give her the care she needed.Comedy, she says, was everything. “It might sound hyperbolic, and I haven’t had much coffee, but humour has saved my life, I think.” Just before McEnany joined Second City, her mother died, following a long illness. “Humour has gotten me through some really hard times. Some of the funniest moments that I’ve had with my family are in that horrible three and a half years that my mom was dying. There was weirdly a lot of healing in that time.”Work In Progress is a deft blend of wry pessimism and tenderness, particularly in its central love story between Abby and a younger trans man, Chris (The Politician’s Theo Germaine). “It’s based on a real-life romance that I had. I was actually just talking with my ex this morning, and they’re coming to the premiere here in Chicago,” she explains. As the couple’s relationship begins, Chris takes Abby to a queer party. “When I was writing it, I was like, this can be a queer wonderland. There’s gonna be performances, art, sex toys, leather, and it’s going to be this wonderful coming together of queerness and ersity and openness and expression. I define myself as a person as a sex-positive prude,” she laughs. “And this is such an opening of the character’s eyes. Her whole life is opening up and other opportunities are coming to the fore, and Chris is the vehicle for that, for sure.”Elsewhere, Saturday Night Live alumnus Julia Sweeney has a recurring role as herself. In the early 90s, Sweeney created the androgynous SNL character, Pat, largely based on the gag that nobody knew Pat’s gender. “One of my stories in that storytelling show was that Julia Sweeney’s Pat made my life a living hell,” McEnany says. “I was starting to wear a lot of overalls, I was masculine, big, fat – my weight fluctuates a lot – and people would be calling me Pat. And if you’re called Pat, nobody’s giving you a compliment.” She remembers being in a lesbian bar in the late 90s, being called Pat. “It’s like, wow, this is supposed to be a safe space and I’m being judged for what I look like? It’s hateful. Where do I get a break? It really defeated me.”When the fictional Abby runs into Julia Sweeney in a bar, the shock of finally confronting her nemesis after so many years causes her to pass out. The real Julia Sweeney used to live in Chicago, and McEnany and Mason reached out to her through a mutual friend. “She was so supportive, she was on board from the very beginning. And she’s been such a genuine joy,” she says. Did it give her chance to readdress Pat herself? “I think so. I love her openness about it. She had an opportunity, and we had an opportunity.” In fact, they got on so well that when they were unsure whether Work in Progress would be picked up, Sweeney invited McEnany to live with her in Los Angeles. “I cannot tell you how much I love her.”Like McEnany, Work in Progress is a true original, and it marks the arrival of an important new voice. But there is one question left to answer. How close is she to bringing back “wassup?” “Oh man!

At the start of her campaign, Democrats viewed the California senator as one of the party’s strongest contenders against Donald Trump – a barrier-breaking former prosecutor who could rebuild the coalition of voters that helped elect Barack Obama twice.But she struggled to define a clear rationale for her candidacy and in recent weeks her campaign was beset by upheaval and layoffs.Harris notified her staff on Tuesday afternoon shortly, according to a campaign aide, before her campaign emailed supporters.In the email, Harris wrote: “I’ve taken stock and looked at this from every angle, and over the last few days have come to one of the hardest decisions of my life. My campaign for president simply doesn’t have the financial resources we need to continue.”“But I want to be clear with you,” she added. “I am still very much in this fight.”As the news dropped, Harris’s husband, Douglas Emhoff, tweeted a picture of the couple embracing with the caption: “I’ve got you. As always.”Harris officially launched her campaign in January with an impressive rally in Oakland that drew nearly 22,000 people and even earned plaudits from Trump, who called it the “best opening so far”.She posted a strong performance in the first debate in Miami in June, in stark opposition to the former vice-president, Joe Biden.But the polling and fundraising boost that followed that debate performance was short-lived, and after that she never managed to break into the first rank of candidates, which Biden still leads from the Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.Harris recently shifted her focus to Iowa, the first state to vote, in hopes that a top-tier finish could propel her forward. But Buttigieg has moved into leads in Iowa and New Hampshire, the next state to vote.Harris was the only African American woman in the primary, a point of pride for her campaign.“Our campaign uniquely spoke to the experiences of black women and people of color – and their importance to the success and future of this party,” Harris said in the email to supporters.“Our campaign demanded no one should be taken for granted by any political party. We will keep up that fight because no one should be made to fight alone.”The deadline to appear on the primary ballot in California is Friday and polling showed that Harris was trailing far behind in her home state, a troubling sign for any presidential hopeful.Harris had already met the fundraising and polling requirements to qualify for the December debate in Los Angeles. With her withdrawal, six candidates are now expected to participate in the debate – all of them white. There are nine days left for other candidates to qualify.The primary race has been shaped by progressive ideas and Harris found herself stuck between the sweeping populism of Warren and Sanders and the return-to-normal appeal of Biden.She began by casting herself as a reform-minded progressive, signing on to Sanders’ Medicare for All bill in the Senate. But her prosecutorial past and a shift on Medicare for all policy drew criticism from the left that she struggled to overcome.At the same time, she was unable to chip away at Biden’s strength among black voters, a crucial Democratic constituency that her campaign identified as a priority.Her campaign, which drew inspiration from Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman in Congress, initially presented Harris as the candidate “speaking truth” in response to Trump’s persistent attacks on women and minorities as well as the urgency of acting on gun violence and criminal justice reform.But her wavering on policy reinforced the “Cautious Kamala” reputation she developed as she climbed the ranks from San Francisco district attorney to attorney general of California and then US senator.Supporters say Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, faced a double standard as a woman of color running for the presidency in the shadow of Hillary Clinton’s loss to Trump in 2016. Recently she began to speak about what she called the “elephant in the room” – her electability as a woman of color.In a final iteration of her campaign’s messaging, Harris presented herself as the candidate best equipped to “prosecute” the case against Trump. “Justice is on the ballot,” she told voters in the last debate.Supporters eager to see Harris take on Trump may yet have a chance next year, when the Senate is likely to hold an impeachment trial against Trump. As a member of the Senate judiciary committee, Harris has become well known for her sharp questioning of Trump administration officials and she is likely to be a prominent voice.A Twitter exchange with the president on Tuesday night offered a glimpse of what that clash might look like.“Too bad. We will miss you Kamala!” said Trump, who has made a point to comment on every Democratic drop out, even long-shot candidates.“Don’t worry, Mr President,” Harris shot back. “I’ll see you at your trial.”Her Democratic rivals responded to the news with a mix of shock and regret.Buttigieg celebrated the California senator’s long career and predicted she would continue to play a vital role in the Democratic party.Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said he was “stunned” to see Harris end her campaign and thanked her for offering his family “help and guidance when she didn’t need to”.Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who clashed with Harris during the debates, said she respected Harris.In a video, Julián Castro, the former housing secretary under Obama and the only Hiic candidate running for president, assailed the media for its coverage of her campaign, saying that as a black woman she was held to a double standard that was “grossly unfair and unfortunate”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d38a3bf6be036d884718cae5ca5c5fa7a4f2d3f0/0_171_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec1d53bc8c8199ea8c4efe6432d5d174","title":"kamal harris campaign analysis democrats 2020","story":"The California senator’s campaign began with a huge rally but factional infighting and lack of a clear message took their tollNewspaper editors infamously prepare obituaries before their subjects have died, keeping them ominously in reserve until the moment of truth.The writing was on the wall for Senator Kamala Harris last week when both the New York Times and Washington Post published political obituaries about a campaign in disarray.The death of the dream that a woman of colour could become the next US president was officially pronounced at 1.19pm on Tuesday in an email to supporters with the subject heading: “I am suspending my campaign today.”Harris was the biggest name so far to withdraw from a crowded and volatile 2020 presidential race. When she launched her campaign at an outdoor rally in Oakland, California, in January, few in the crowd of more than 22,000 people could have guessed that she would be gone before Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, or Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur and political novice.In fact that rally was the high point. There was never a better moment in the Harris campaign. Apart from a classic debate soundbite, it was all downhill from there for a candidate whose campaign succumbed to factional infighting and whose “let’s have a conversation” mantra was ill-suited to the political moment.“From my perspective, she never connected with the electorate,” says Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden and board director for TransparentBusiness. “I don’t think voters ever got to see her true and authentic self due to vacillating policy stances and plans. There was an inconsistency to her at a time when voters are seeking stability.“Combining that with a campaign team that appeared to be in turmoil, you have a recipe for disaster.”On paper, Harris, 55, should have been the ideal antidote to Donald Trump: a “female Barack Obama” who could rebuild his coalition. Like the former president, she is mixed race (her father from Jamaica, her mother from India), spent part of her childhood abroad (in Canada) and became a lawyer, then the first black US senator in California’s history.In congressional hearings, Harris had tormented Jeff Sessions and other figures from the Trump administration. She seemed to be the ideal person to cross-examine Trump on a debate stage and prosecute the case against his corruption, misogyny and racism.Harris raised an impressive $12m in the first three months of her campaign and quickly secured major endorsements in her home state, which offers the biggest haul of delegates in the Democratic primary contest.But as the competition grew, Harris’s fundraising flatlined and the media shone its light elsewhere. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren pulled in tens of millions of dollars from grassroots supporters, while Buttigieg drew money from traditional donors.Some detected bias. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said: “I feel in many ways the women, and Kamala in particular as a black woman, were not treated the same as the white men in this race. There was an environment of sexism and racism.”In recent weeks, reports emerged that Harris’s staff complained about being badly treated another female candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar, has faced similar allegations. Brown commented: “I only hear complaints about the women. Either all the men are just nice bosses or they are not judged by the same standard. I have not heard a real critique of what kind of managers the white men are.“The white men can just turn up and be charismatic and that’s enough. For some reason, a woman has to be an extreme nurturer or a stellar boss. When Pete Buttigieg had a surge, he got all kind of press. I never saw that kind of headline for her she always came in from behind. If you look at how she was treated as a candidate, it was completely different.”Others argue that Harris, who constantly stressed the need to “speak the truth” on race and other issues, lacked ideology and seemed vague and inconsistent on policy.Like other Democrats, she stumbled over the issue of healthcare, at first indicating that she supported abolishing private health insurance, then back-pedalling and claiming she had misheard a question at one of the debates. She eventually released a plan that preserved a role for private insurance.But in June, struggling to break former vice-president Joe Biden’s lock on African American voters, Harris produced arguably the stand-out moment of the primary debates so far. She accused Biden of past opposition to bussing, an effort to racially integrate government schools.“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Harris said, before delivering the killer line: “That little girl was me.”Biden’s head snapped around to look at her. It was a blow to the solar plexus. He tried to defend himself but, up against the clock, blurted out: “My time is up. I’m sorry.”The line, “That little girl was me,” rapidly appeared on T-shirts and a Saturday Night Live parody. However, it also produced sympathy for Biden and a backlash that denied Harris momentum. In the following debates, she seemed to fade into the background.Other catchphrases or stunts never quite took off. There was a “3am agenda” about the hopes and fears that wake people up at three in the morning. It echoed, perhaps unfortunately, Hillary Clinton’s 2008 ad about who is best qualified to answer a 3am phone call in a crisis.And Harris could never quite escape progressive scepticism about her past. She started her career in Oakland, serving as a local prosecutor in the 1990s, before becoming the first African American and the first woman elected as San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and as California attorney general in 2010.During her presidential run, Harris billed herself as a “progressive prosecutor”. She titled her first book Smart on Crime – looking to leave the “hard on crime” and “soft on crime” stereotypes behind.Yet Harris’s contradictory, complicated record as a prosecutor in California corroded her presidential bid. Even as she started programmes to steer low-level drug offenders away from prison, she boasted about increasing conviction rates and supported fellow prosecutors accused of misconduct.Her anti-truancy programme, which led to the arrest of parents whose children were chronically absent, her inaction on police brutality and her opposition to decriminalising sex work also drew criticism from progressive voters. Eventually, she decided to embrace this biography with the slogan “Justice Is on the Ballot”, and by vowing to “prosecute the case” against a “criminal” president.California, which should have been a stronghold, proved problematic in other ways. Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University, wrote in the Washington Post last month: “Analysts seeking to understand the Kamala Harris flop need look no further than Harris’s ostensible selling point: her record in California. After nearly three years as the state’s junior senator, Harris doesn’t have much to show for herself.“Take, for example, Harris’s signature policy issue. What is it? Her Democratic colleague, Dianne Feinstein, is known among California voters for her policy-grinding: on assault weapons bans protecting the Golden State’s forests, deserts and lakes and the occasional supreme court nomination brouhaha.”The downward spiral was clear and irreversible. Harris finished September with $9m in cash, according to finance disclosures Warren had nearly $26m at the same stage. Last month Harris’s campaign announced it would fire staff at its Baltimore headquarters and move some people from other early states to Iowa for a last stand.Aides shared grievances with the media, including questions over whether Harris’s sister, Maya, the campaign chairwoman, had too much influence. Several senior aides quit to join other campaigns.One of them, Kelly Mehlenbacher, wrote in a resignation letter obtained by the New York Times: “Because we have refused to confront our mistakes, foster an environment of critical thinking and honest feedback, or trust the expertise of talented staff, we find ourselves making the same unforced errors over and over.”Harris cited lack of financial resources for her decision to terminate the campaign now. She had qualified for this month’s debate, which will be held in her home state, but her exit, which represents her first defeat as a political candidate, puts the party at risk of a debate featuring white contenders only – a dismal look for a party that had the most erse field in political history.“This is America,” muses Brown. “All of what I want to believe about America, she continues to show how embedded racism is in the political system.”Additional reporting by Maanvi Singh in Oakland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6e0c9ff7c93c5fa037e28f6738e49c3d54677f/0_131_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9cccd43ffd9aff0b6bb53f3d0049208e","title":"north korea christmas gift missile nuclear","story":"North Korea yesterday issued a thinly veiled warning it could resume long-distance missile tests in the next few weeks if the US does not change its negotiating position on the regime’s nuclear disarmament, saying “it is entirely up to the US what Christmas gift it will select to get”.Ri Thae Song, the deputy foreign minister, said in a statement translated on the state news agency that the “year-end time limit” set for the US was “drawing nearer” and accused the Trump administration of playing for time in discussions with Pyongyang, in the hope of avoiding a standoff before US presidential elections in November.Joshua Pollack, the editor of the Nonproliferation Review, pointed out that Pyongyang has used the threat of a “gift” before, to refer to its first test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in 2017.He said that Pyongyang also warned the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that he could face “a real ballistic missile in the not distant future and under his nose”.“They might not necessarily wait until the end of the year to show their displeasure on how the diplomacy with the United States has gone,” Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see an ICBM go over Japan on Christmas Day itself.”Donald Trump is touting his summit diplomacy with Kim Jong-un as one of his signature foreign policy achievements. He points in particular to North Korea’s moratorium on testing nuclear warheads and ICBMs. An ICBM test over the holiday season would represent a significant blow as his re-election campaign moves into higher gear.Speaking in London, where he is attending a Nato meeting, Trump played down the security concerns over the North Korean nuclear and missile programmes. When a journalist put it to him that Kim continued to developed both programmes, the president replied “You don’t know that”, even though it reflects the US intelligence consensus.However, Trump did acknowledge that Kim had staged a series of short- and medium-range missile tests.“He definitely likes sending rockets up, doesn’t he? That’s why I call him Rocket Man,” Trump said. He added: “Now we have the most powerful military we’ve ever had and we’re by far the most powerful country in the world. And, hopefully, we don’t have to use it, but if we do, we’ll use it.”Trump said that at their first summit meeting in Singapore in June 2017, Kim had promised to “denuclearize”.“I hope he lives up to the agreement, but we’re going to find out,” the president said.In fact the Singapore agreement said “the DPRK commits to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”. To North Korea, the denuclearization of the peninsula, signifies a gradual process of mutual disarmament that also involves the withdrawal of US strategic weapons from the region.The difference in interpretations was papered over until the second summit in Hanoi in February 2018. The talks fell apart when Trump presented a plan requiring the wholesale dismantling of the North Korean nuclear and missile programmes in return for comprehensive sanctions relief. Kim wanted a step-by-step process.Since the collapse of the Hanoi talks, Kim and his regime have issued repeated threats that North Korea could resume nuclear or ICBM testing if the US did not make more concessions or demand less of Pyongyang.In his remarks in London, Trump hinted at possible concessions over its military deployment in South Korea, saying “it can be debated” whether the troop presence there was in US national security interests.“I can go either way,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134a8eb74708568fca81a6a87669548b623aae03/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdcd70f8e899e27749feaab85273609d","title":"us house approves uighur act calling for sanctions on chinas politburo xinjiang muslim","story":"Legislation in response to crackdown in Xinjiang prompts angry response from BeijingThe US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly approved a bill that would require the Trump administration to toughen its response to China’s crackdown on its Muslim minority in Xinjiang, drawing swift condemnation from Beijing.The Uighur Act of 2019 is a stronger version of a bill that angered Beijing when it passed the Senate in September. It calls on the president, Donald Trump, to impose sanctions for the first time on a member of China’s powerful politburo even as he seeks a trade deal with Beijing.Last week Trump signed into law legislation supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong despite angry objections from China.The Uighur bill, which passed by 407-1 in the Democratic-controlled House, requires the president to condemn abuses against Muslims and call for the closure of mass detention camps in the north-western region of Xinjiang.It calls for sanctions against senior Chinese officials who it says are responsible and specifically names the Xinjiang Communist party secretary, Chen Quanguo, who as a politburo member is in the upper echelons of China’s leadership.The revised bill still has to be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate before being sent to Trump. The White House has yet to say whether Trump would sign or veto the bill, which contains a provision allowing the president to waive sanctions if he determines that to be in the national interest.China’s foreign ministry said the bill was “arrogantly discrediting China’s efforts to combat terrorism” and seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs. In a statement, it said the situation in Xinjiang was “not a human rights, nationality, or religion issue at all, but an issue of anti-terrorism and anti-secession”.The ministry said the US plan to use Xinjiang to “undermine Xinjiang’s prosperity and stability and curb China’s development” will fail. “We urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes, prevent the Xinjiang-related bill from becoming law, and stop using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs. China will respond accordingly to the development of the situation.”The Chinese state-owned tabloid The Global Times quoted experts as saying Beijing will take “strong countermeasures”.China has denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps are providing vocational training. It has warned of retaliation “in proportion” if Chen were targeted.The White House and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.China responded on Monday to the Hong Kong legislation by saying US military ships and aircraft would not be allowed to visit Hong Kong, and announced sanctions against several US non-government organisations.Analysts say China’s reaction to passage of the Uighur bill could be stronger, although some doubted it would go so far as imposing visa bans on the likes of the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who has called China’s treatment of Uighurs “the stain of the century” and has been repeatedly denounced by Beijing.Global Times, a tabloid published by the official People’s Daily newspaper of China’s ruling Communist party, tweeted that Beijing would soon release a so-called unreliable entities list imposing sanctions against those who harm China’s interests.It reported that China was expediting the process for the list because the US House bill would “harm Chinese firms’ interests”, and that “relevant” US entities would be part of Beijing’s list.The Republican US Representative Chris Smith called China’s actions in “modern-day concentration camps” in Xinjiang “audaciously repressive” involving “mass internment of millions on a scale not seen since the Holocaust”.“We cannot be silent. We must demand an end to these barbaric practices,” Smith said, adding that Chinese officials must be held accountable for “crimes against humanity”.The Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, called China’s treatment of the Uighurs “an outrage to the collective conscience of the world”, adding that “America is watching”.“Today the human dignity and human rights of the Uighur community are under threat from Beijing’s barbarous actions, which are an outrage to the collective conscience of the world,” she said shortly before the vote.Chris Johnson, a China expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said passage of the bill could lead to a further blurring of lines between the trade issue and the broader deteriorating China-US relationship, which Beijing in the past has tended to keep separate.“I think there’s a sort of piling-on factor here that the Chinese are concerned about,” he said.Trump said on Monday that the Hong Kong legislation did not make trade negotiations with China easier but he still believed Beijing wanted a deal.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca2d088384dbb18c44c192b2d065af41accbe290/0_195_4113_2468/master/4113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb2dd36c1f86252f9b9683ce08bdecad","title":"wednesday briefing labour plan is money in your pocket mcdonnell","story":"Shadow chancellor to say families would save £6,700 under Corbyn … damning Trump impeachment report goes forward … and could drone swarms upend warfare?by  Kate Lyons and  Warren MurrayGood morning. With just over a week to go, Labour has turned to retail politics, trying to sell the country on the financial benefit of its policies – while the prime minister does his best to dodge his old friend Donald Trump out of fear the president could say something that might hurt his election chances. We have the best of other news – including the Trump impeachment report – and you can read rolling updates of the day’s political news at our live blog.Labour will today try to convince voters of the financial benefit of electing a Corbyn government. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, will say his party’s policies would save families an average of £6,700 a year by “putting a stop to rip-off Britain” as Labour narrows its focus to bread-and-butter issues.In a dossier to be published alongside the speech, McDonnell will claim that policies including nationalising utilities and reducing the cost of rail season tickets – as well as free childcare for all two- to four-year-olds, free prescription charges and free school meals – would help the hip pocket of average households.However, Labour candidates are privately concerned about the scattergun nature of the giveaways, with one saying the manifesto, while good, is “just long and confusing” and some promises could appear too good to be true.Trump’s presence in the UK for Nato talks continues to loom over the election. The summit started with heated exchanges and further tensions are expected as leaders meet again today. Trump is seen as an electoral liability for the Conservatives over fears that he may be interested in putting the NHS on the table in US-UK trade talks – though yesterday the president categorically denied the US was interested in the health service. Boris Johnson has so far managed to keep his distance from the US president, with Marina Hyde writing that Johnson will continue to studiously avoid the president because “Tories sense even a handshake with Trump could piss their electoral bed”.Sign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow’s afternoon round-up from the campaign trail – direct to your email inbox.\u0026gt All four artists shortlisted for the 2019 Turner prize have been named joint winners and shared the £40,000 prize after they made a plea for judges to recognise the causes of “commonality, multiplicity and solidarity” in what has been a isive year.The quartet are Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo and Tai Shani.  art critic Adrian Searle says that for an award with a colourful history this year’s result could be the upset to end them all.Anushka Asthana visits Winchester to find out which way Tory remainers are planning to vote next Thursday.

The uncertainty was compounded when the US House of Representatives passed a bill that could require Trump to sanction members of the politburo for their treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang. Beijing reacted furiously.

The Sun’s position seems to be that if the president said it, it must be true: “Trump thumps chump over NHS lies”. “I wouldn’t want NHS on silver platter” says the Express. “We have no interest in the NHS” is the ’s splash headline.The  reports that the Labour leader intends to press the president over his trade machinations. The paper’s headline is “Corbyn ups pressure over NHS as Trump rows back”. The  splashes with “Corbyn casts doubt on Trump’s NHS pledge” and adds in a subhead that Tories admit medicines from US drug companies could cost more after Brexit. “We’ll force tech firms to pay more, says PM” is the take in the Times on Boris Johnson’s pledge to have the Googles and the Facebooks of the world make a “fairer contribution”, which the paper says runs the risk of a rift with Trump who has threatened France with tariffs for doing the same.The Mail sounds the alarm bell over a “Deadly gamble on our health” as an NHS report ties online betting in with social scourges including heavy drinking, obesity and chronic disease. “Labour to put £6,176 in your pocket” says the Mirror as it tots up the benefits of Corbyn’s plans to end “rip-off Britain”.

The Dublin man was one of 2,000 participants from 69 countries ranging from six- to-87- years- old. The trail included two steep ascents including Jebel Akhdar, known as the Green Mountain, and 3,000m high Jebel Shams, one of the highest points on the Arabian peninsula.After his win, Mr Keith said: “It was so technical, possibly the most technical race I’ve ever done. There was a long 1,000m descent which you normally would expect to make tons of time on but we were so slow. “It makes it easier to keep going mentally because it’s so technical that you need to concentrate pretty much the entire time.“ There’s no real let up mentally and it was intense racing all the way. But very enjoyable, Oman is a gorgeous country and the mountains are truly spectacular.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4103627.1575396480!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"typical smartphone user in ireland checks device 50 times a day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn call: women check their phones 54 times each day on average, with men said to look at them 46 times every day, according to Deloitte’s Mobile Consumer Survey 2019Irish people’s reliance on smart phones appears to have eased slightly compared with last year although the average phone user still manages to pick up their device more than three times every waking hour.The typical phone user in Ireland now checks their device 50 times a day compared with an average of 55 times last year, with women proving slightly more inclined to pick up their phones then men, according to a new survey published by Deloitte.Women check their phones 54 times each day on average, with men said to look at them 46 times every day, the consultancy firm’s Mobile Consumer Survey 2019, published on Wednesday morning, says.The survey suggests one in three people check their phone within five minutes of waking for reasons other than switching off their alarm, while 4 per cent admit reaching for their device more than 200 times per day or about once every five minutes.More than half of those polled said they felt that they were using their mobile phones too much with 29 per cent suggesting that over-use of their devices was to blame for higher levels of distraction when performing tasks, with a similar number claiming their phones were to blame for their failure to get to bed on time .Fear of dependencyA further 26 per cent said they constantly felt they had to check their phone. This fear of dependency may explain why 66 per cent of those polled said they were trying to limit mobile phone usage.Accessing WhatsApp is the most popular use of apps among smartphone users in Ireland with 85 per cent of people using their smartphones for this purpose. The next most common reason people use their smartphones is to access work email, on 72 per cent, followed by making phone calls on 60 per cent.Just over one in four people stream movies or TV series on their mobiles at least once a week which may explain why 21 per cent said they would switch to a 5G network as soon as it became available.The survey reveals 96 per cent of Irish people now own a mobile phone with 91 per cent having a smartphone. Samsung is the most popular brand with 34 per cent of people owning a device made by that company. Apple is in second place on 30 per cent with Huawei doubling its market share in Ireland to 14 per cent over the last 12 months."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4103595.1575395342!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk election sylvia hermon a hard act to follow in north down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSylvia Hermon during the 2017 Westminster election count. Photograph:  Brian LittlePressEyeWhoever wins North Down will depend largely on where Sylvia Hermon’s votes go. What Green, Sinn Féin and SDLP voters do will also have a bearing on the result.After 18 years as MP the independent unionist, to some surprise, decided to call it a day when the general election was announced for December 12th.The three main contenders seeking to fill her seat are members of the mothballed Assembly: the DUP’s Alex Easton, Alan Chambers of the Ulster Unionist Party and Stephen Farry, deputy leader of Alliance. The fourth candidate is Matthew Robinson of the Northern Ireland Conservatives, which tends to poll around two to three per cent in North Down.If Hermon were to confer her blessing on one of the three chief candidates it could influence the outcome. She is a Remainer in this constituency where 52 per cent voted to stay in the EU. She is also antipathetic to the DUP, so that would appear to rule out Easton’s chances of getting her seal of approval.A former member of the UUP and liberal in outlook, she could be torn between Chambers and Farry. But so far she’s keeping schtum.Unusual constituencyNorth Down is a rather curious constituency. It is pretty affluent and decidedly unionist. Nonetheless, its voters tend to opt for more free-thinking, slightly maverick (in unionist terms) politicians to represent them at Westminster.With Sinn Féin’s abstentionist policy, Hermon stood out as the only Northern Ireland-based MP who offered a Remain voice in the House of Commons. Before her was Robert McCartney, who also tended to plough an independent unionist furrow, and before him Jim Kilfedder – all inidualistic politicians who were never comfortable following a party whip.Hermon, widow of the late RUC chief constable John Hermon, has always been well got in North Down. She first won the seat with a 7,000 majority and up until 2015 held the seat with majorities ranging from 5,000 to 15,000.But in 2017 Easton, in his second consecutive challenge, came within 1,200 votes of Hermon – and that was with the UUP absent from the polling paper – whereas in 2015 she was 9,000 votes ahead of him. He is a hard worker, no frills, just gets on with it. No sooner had election day been called than Easton was out with his teams erecting posters, calling on doors and working hard for votes.Meanwhile, the UUP and Alliance were biding their time waiting to see would Hermon run again, to determine how serious a challenge they might mount. A week later she decided she wasn’t standing which brought Chambers and Farry into the race but lagging behind Easton in terms of the canvassing ground war.At the time of the DUP manifesto launch on November 28th, Easton said he had canvassed 19,000 houses and intended to knock on a total of 30,000 doors before the campaign’s end.Close callThe impetus now appears to be with Easton. But then again in this rather contrarian constituency where will those 16,000 Hermon votes from two years ago end up? Moreover, the Greens, Sinn Féin and the SDLP aren’t fielding candidates and they polled about 3,500 votes in 2017. So there is close to 20,000 votes a-begging that, if properly vied out, could make life difficult for the DUP man.For that to unfold either Chambers or Farry would need to emerge as the candidate with the sole chance of defeating him.Here it is interesting to study the 2017 Assembly results. Easton topped the poll with 8,034 votes followed by Chambers and Farry who were neck and neck on 7,151 and 7,014 votes respectively.Loyalist posters have appeared in Bangor warning that a vote for “the unholy Alliance” would mean a “Sinn FéinIRA win”. That could prompt some of those aforementioned independent-minded former Hermon supporters to cast their lot in with Farry.Farry insists he has established himself as the only rival to Easton. He said, “It is a straight fight representing the clearest Remain and Leave choices. Sylvia Hermon is a hard act to follow but I am hopefully best-placed to attract most of her previous voters. It should be very close.”The reaction from the Chambers camp was the Mandy Rice-Davies response, “Well, he would say that wouldn’t he?”. The line was that Chambers won more votes than Farry two years ago and might do so again.Were Hermon to make an 11th-hour intervention it might change the dynamic to a degree but at the moment Easton’s hard graft, and being sharply out of the blocks, could be enough to get him first to the winning tape.Can Boris Johnson get a majority and finally deliver Brexit?

Photograph: Yui MokPool via The New York TimesIt was like a giant game of hide and seek at Buckingham Palace last night as Boris Johnson avoided Donald Trump and palace flunkeys contrived to keep Jeremy Corbyn away from the US president. The prime minister was so anxious to avoid being seen with Trump that he left him and his wife Melania shivering on the steps of Downing Street rather than go out to meet them.Corbyn had planned to confront the president at the palace about his intentions in any future trade deal, seeking assurances that nothing would affect Britain’s public services. But the Labour leader, who is fastidiously polite in private, will keep up the attack in public so that the threat to the National Health Service (NHS) remains at the top of the agenda.Trump remained on-message where the British election is concerned, telling reporters he wanted to stay out of it before adding that he was sure Johnson would do a great job. Johnson and Trump will hold separate press conferences today at the end of Nato’s 70th anniversary summit, which is being held at a hotel in Watford.The US president’s mood may not be improved by the release overnight of video appearing to show Johnson with Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau gossiping about the president’s 40-minute, impromptu press conference earlier in the day.The Nato summit has had a muffling effect on the election campaign as the Conservatives hold their breath waiting for Trump to leave without causing any trouble. The polls continue to show the Conservatives comfortably ahead, with Labour gaining ground while the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party are squeezed.The Tories remain confident despite the polls’ recent tightening, partly because they believe their vote is holding up better than expected in Scotland and the south-east of England, where they were braced for heavy losses at the start of the campaign. A new YouGov poll points to a net gain of one seat for the Conservatives in London, despite a recovery for Labour in the capital.The Evening Standard reports that the Conservatives are hiding Johnson from London voters in Facebook ads, while the prime minister is front and centre in ads directed at voters in the Midlands and the north of England.Sebastian Payne in the FT on shifting allegiances in Surrey’s Tory heartlands.What’s on todayBoris Johnson hosts Nato leaders at a summit in Watford10.30am Ulster Unionist Party manifesto launch in Belfast11am Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell makes a speech in Birmingham about the economy7.30pm Andrew Neil interviews Jo Swinson on BBC OneDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future.\u0026nbsp“The UK’s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.Average wealth per person in the UK has risen every year since 2008 and is now 41 per cent above its 2007 level, but the spoils have not been ided evenly.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Based on data\u0026nbspin Credit Suisse\u0027s World Wealth Report, the Equality Trust calculates that the richest 1 per cent in the UK owns the same wealth as the bottom 80 per cent, or 53.2 million people.Such comparisons have sometimes been criticised in the past because they define\u0026nbspsome people with debts as having zero or negative wealth, when they may actually be living relatively comfortably. The latest official figures estimate that a household in the middle of the bottom fifth of the population owns £13,854.What is not disputed is that wealth has risen sharply over the past decade as those with assets such as shares and investment property have enjoyed rising prices. Over the same period, rewards for work have not kept up. Average inflation-adjusted wages have still not recovered to their pre-crisis peak in 2007 – the longest wage stagnation in two centuries.Welfare cuts and tax changes since the Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 have hurt the poorest the most.By far the worst affected have been the poorest 10 per cent of households with children, who have seen their incomes cut by almost a fifth –\u0026nbsp£3,800 per year, research published last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows. Overall, households in the lowest tenth –\u0026nbspwith or without children – have seen their budgets cut by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe highest-income decile also pay 4 per cent more of their income as tax, the IFS found. That group, however, which has more savings, investments and property, is also most likely to have benefited from rising wealth.Inequality has become an important issue in the election, with the Labour Party pointing out that a third of the UK\u0027s billionaires have donated to the Conservatives.The Resolution Foundation warned last week that child poverty will rise to its\u0026nbsphighest since the aftermath of the Second World War under the Conservatives, because the party\u0027s manifesto retains existing benefit cuts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

We can do better!”On his radio show, Dyke further explained to his listeners that he would not be playing the track this festive season. “I hope I’m not going to ruin your Christmas,” he said, “but I’ve decided that I am no longer comfortable with playing \u0027Fairytale of New York\u0027 by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The 50 best albums of the decade – 2010 to 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career.

Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. “I think Christmas songs should be about excited children, toys, Christmas trees, snowy streets, ski lodges, reindeer, wrapping paper, Santa, family, peace on earth and love,” the DJ added. “I just find The Pogues’ ‘Fairytale of New York’ a nasty, nasty song.”“Fairytale of New York” is a source of annual consternation due to its lyrics, with some radio stations censoring the track to prevent possible offence.The story behind The Pogues’ ‘Fairytale of New York’In 2017, MacGowan defended the track’s use of the word “f*****”, writing in a statement: “The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character. She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history and she is down on her luck and desperate.“Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it but she is not intended to offend!” he added.“Fairytale of New York” reached number two in the UK Top 40 on its release in 1987, and continues to be one of the UK’s most popular Christmas songs. In 2018, it resurfaced to reach number four in the charts.Fairytale of New York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He has £9.4bn, according to Forbes.Hedge fund manager Michael Platt has £6.1bn and Conservative party donors\u0026nbspSimon and David Reuben\u0026nbsphave accumulated an estimated £5.8bn each. The six men\u0027s collective\u0026nbspwealth is equivalent to that of the least-wealthy fifth of the UK population.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.General election: Facts and figures Show all 54Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.254 Seats to watch in Yorkshire554 General election 2019 poll of polls654 Seats to watch in north-east England854 Seats to watch in the East Midlands1054 Seats to watch in south-west England1154 Planned increase in day-to-day departmental spending1354 Opinion polls (two weeks to go) v election result 20171454 Opinion polls (two weeks to go) v election result 20151654 Applications to register to vote1754 How many women MPs could there be after the election?1854 General election 2019 opinion polls in Wales1954 A comparison of the length of the manifestos of the main parties2054 Mentions of key words in the main party manifestos2154 Mentions of key words in the main party manifestos2454 Council houses built in the UK 1951-20182554 Council houses built in the UK2654 Opinion polls (three weeks to go) v election result 20152754 Opinion polls (three weeks to go) v election result 20173254 Prime ministers with shortest time in office3354 Applications to register to vote3454 Major toll roads \u0026amp bridges in Great Britain3554 Police workforce in England and Wales3654 Police officers in England and Wales3754 Police-recorded homicides in England and Wales3854 Knife crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales3954 Opinion polls in 20194054 Number of candidates per seat4154 Candidates standing in the 2019 General Election4254 Candidates at UK general elections since 19794354 Women candidates at the 2019 General Election4454 Prime ministers with smallest constituency majorities to defend4554 Cost of administering polls since 20104654 People\u0027s Vote group priority list of recommended candidates in key target seats4754 MPs retiring from the House of Commons at general elections4854 Lib DemsPlaid CymruGreen pact in Wales4954 Lib DemsGreen pact in England, seats where Greens have stood down in favour of Lib Dems5054 Lib DemsGreen pact in England5154 Nationality of NHS workforce in England5254 Proportion of NHS workforce in England who are not UK nationals5354 Long-term net migration to the UK254 Seats to watch in Yorkshire554 General election 2019 poll of polls654 Seats to watch in north-east England854 Seats to watch in the East Midlands1054 Seats to watch in south-west England1154 Planned increase in day-to-day departmental spending1354 Opinion polls (two weeks to go) v election result 20171454 Opinion polls (two weeks to go) v election result 20151654 Applications to register to vote1754 How many women MPs could there be after the election?1854 General election 2019 opinion polls in Wales1954 A comparison of the length of the manifestos of the main parties2054 Mentions of key words in the main party manifestos2154 Mentions of key words in the main party manifestos2454 Council houses built in the UK 1951-20182554 Council houses built in the UK2654 Opinion polls (three weeks to go) v election result 20152754 Opinion polls (three weeks to go) v election result 20173254 Prime ministers with shortest time in office3354 Applications to register to vote3454 Major toll roads \u0026amp bridges in Great Britain3554 Police workforce in England and Wales3654 Police officers in England and Wales3754 Police-recorded homicides in England and Wales3854 Knife crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales3954 Opinion polls in 20194054 Number of candidates per seat4154 Candidates standing in the 2019 General Election4254 Candidates at UK general elections since 19794354 Women candidates at the 2019 General Election4454 Prime ministers with smallest constituency majorities to defend4554 Cost of administering polls since 20104654 People\u0027s Vote group priority list of recommended candidates in key target seats4754 MPs retiring from the House of Commons at general elections4854 Lib DemsPlaid CymruGreen pact in Wales4954 Lib DemsGreen pact in England, seats where Greens have stood down in favour of Lib Dems5054 Lib DemsGreen pact in England5154 Nationality of NHS workforce in England5254 Proportion of NHS workforce in England who are not UK nationals5354 Long-term net migration to the UKOver the last decade, billionaires in the UK have collectively more than doubled their wealth, the Equality Trust\u0027s figures show.“Such extreme wealth in the hands of so few people demonstrates just how broken the economic system is,” said Dr Wanda Wyporska, executive director of the Equality Trust.“Behind the numbers, the UK’s extreme inequality is the story of Ferraris and food banks. Families across the country are working for their poverty and unable to promise their children a better, secure future.\u0026nbsp“The UK’s economy delivers billions for a few and poverty for millions. Destitution is the sad reality for millions this Christmas.Average wealth per person in the UK has risen every year since 2008 and is now 41 per cent above its 2007 level, but the spoils have not been ided evenly.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Based on data\u0026nbspin Credit Suisse\u0027s World Wealth Report, the Equality Trust calculates that the richest 1 per cent in the UK owns the same wealth as the bottom 80 per cent, or 53.2 million people.Such comparisons have sometimes been criticised in the past because they define\u0026nbspsome people with debts as having zero or negative wealth, when they may actually be living relatively comfortably. The latest official figures estimate that a household in the middle of the bottom fifth of the population owns £13,854.What is not disputed is that wealth has risen sharply over the past decade as those with assets such as shares and investment property have enjoyed rising prices. Over the same period, rewards for work have not kept up. Average inflation-adjusted wages have still not recovered to their pre-crisis peak in 2007 – the longest wage stagnation in two centuries.Welfare cuts and tax changes since the Conservative-led coalition came to power in 2010 have hurt the poorest the most.By far the worst affected have been the poorest 10 per cent of households with children, who have seen their incomes cut by almost a fifth –\u0026nbsp£3,800 per year, research published last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows. Overall, households in the lowest tenth –\u0026nbspwith or without children – have seen their budgets cut by 7 per cent.\u0026nbspThe highest-income decile also pay 4 per cent more of their income as tax, the IFS found. That group, however, which has more savings, investments and property, is also most likely to have benefited from rising wealth.Inequality has become an important issue in the election, with the Labour Party pointing out that a third of the UK\u0027s billionaires have donated to the Conservatives.The Resolution Foundation warned last week that child poverty will rise to its\u0026nbsphighest since the aftermath of the Second World War under the Conservatives, because the party\u0027s manifesto retains existing benefit cuts.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And there’s only one of us telling the truth, and I know that’s me’The woman who says she was forced to sleep with Prince Andrew after being trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, has flatly contradicted the duke’s denial of an encounter – with a description of how she says the pair first met.Virginia Giuffre said the prince’s “sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere” when they danced at a nightclub – in defiance of his claim that he had been medically unable to sweat.Giving her first UK interview, Ms Giuffre, who was photographed with Andrew at the time, also “implored” British people to “stand beside her” and not accept what happened to her as “being OK”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe insisted the royal team would “keep coming up with ridiculous excuses”.Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace have strongly denied her claims.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England captain Joe Root celebrates reaching his double century during day 4 of the second Test match against New Zealand at Seddon Park in Hamilton, New ZealandA hard frost is seen on the first day of the meteorological winter in Pitlochry, ScotlandA police officer looks at flowers left at London Bridge in central London, after a terrorist wearing a fake suicide vest who went on a knife rampage killing two people, and was shot dead by policeSchool children and students take part in the Youth Strike for Climate in London as part of the Fridays for Future Global Climate StrikeCyclists make their way up a tree lined hill near to Moor Crichel in Dorset.

There was no waiting in the lines obviously – you were with a prince,” she told Panorama.\u0026nbsp“Andrew asked me what I wanted to drink, you know, and I said, ‘Oh, you know, something from the bar’. He had something clear. I know mine was vodka … and then he asked me to dance.“He is the most hideous dancer I’ve ever seen in my life.“I mean it was horrible and this guy was sweating all over me, like his sweat was like it was raining basically everywhere. I was just like ‘ugh’ – grossed out from it, but I knew I had to keep him happy because that’s what Jeffrey and Ghislaine would have expected from me.”When they left the club, Ms Giuffre says Ms Maxwell gave her instructions.“In the car Ghislaine tells me that I have to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey, and that just made me sick.”\u0026nbspShe said that later that evening, she had sex with the duke upstairs at Ms Maxwell’s house in Belgravia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I mean come on.“I’m calling BS on this. He knows what happened, I know what happened.

This is a story of being trafficked, this is a story of abuse and this is a story of your guys’ royalty.”The Panorama interview was recorded before the Prince spoke to Newsnight but she has since told the BBC she stands by every word she said.In response to the programme, Buckingham Palace referred to a previous statement saying: “It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.”A statement last month said the duke “unequivocally regrets his ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein” and “deeply sympathises with those affected who want some form of closure”.The Prince and the Epstein Scandal\u0026nbspis on BBC One at 9pm.Duke of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s also a bit pathetic.“If they were confident in their case, they would simply put that case forward instead of doing something like this to give people the wrong impression.”Raab admits US will be free to charge more for drugs after BrexitApproached by The Independent, the Conservative Party did not deny that its candidate bought up the domain name and refused to comment.The row comes after the controversies that saw the Conservatives set up both a fake ‘factchecking’ service and a fake Labour website that instead pumped out Tory policies.At the weekend, Mr\u0026nbspCorbyn protested that the succession of Tory stunts was bringing “politics and democracy into disrepute”.The address margaretbeckett carries the headline ‘Derby South Labour  Jeremy Corbyn \u0026amp No Brexit’.Created with Sketch.

Anything below 50 means the sector is contracting. However, market watchers might take some relief from the fact that it beat preliminary figures of 48.3, released for the first time ever two weeks ago.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe sector was hit as companies continued to eat up the stockpiles they had built up in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.Companies had worried they might not be able to get some supplies from Europe if Britain crashed out without a deal. However, now that the Brexit date has been postponed, businesses are using up these supplies, and not buying new products.This meant that new orders fell for the seventh month in a row, a fact that was exacerbated by global trade worries. The drop in new export orders was one of the steepest in the past seven years.“A heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending general election,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply.He added: “Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012.“Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties.”Several businesses decided to shut their doors in November, with Mothercare among the highest-profile casualties.Last week Bonmarche announced it was avoiding collapse after being taken out of administration by Peacocks. But around 240 jobs will still be lost as 30 stores are closed before Christmas.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It must still go to the Senate and then the president for approval.It comes just days after Mr Trump signed into law a bill that expressed Congress’s support for the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. China responded to that bill by banning US warships from\u0026nbsp docking in the port city, and bringing sanctions against US NGOs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe new bill, named the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, specifically names the Communist Party’s boss in Xinjiang - Chen Quanguo - as a prime target for sanctions. Chen has been dubbed the “architect” of the Uighur camps, which Beijing describes as “vocational training centres”.Senator Marco Rubio, one of the backers of the legislation, said China was “working to systematically wipe out the ethnic and cultural identities of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities”. “Today, Congress took another important step to hold Chinese officials accountable for egregious and ongoing human rights abuses,” he said.TikTok tries to explain why it took down viral Uighur \u0027makeup\u0027 videoI risked my life getting my parents out of a Uighur detention camp China\u0027s brutal treatment of the Uighurs has now been laid bareChina\u0027s brainwashing of Uighur Muslims revealed by leaked documentsUK joins 22 other UN nations condemning China’s detention of MuslimsThe bill identifies some of the policies used by the Chinese authorities to keep tabs on all the estimated 10 million Uighurs in Xinjiang, not just the hundreds of thousands in detention.These include facial recognition software, the use of QR codes to track how often people pray and general “pervasive, high-tech surveillance, including the collection of DNA samples from children”.The White House is set to say whether it will approve the bill, should it pass the Senate. But it includes a revision that would allow Mr Trump to waive any sanctions if he believed it to be in the national interest.Attributed to foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, it repeated Beijing’s oft-used line that such criticism from Washington “violates international law and basic norms governing international relations, and grossly interferes in China\u0027s internal affairs”.Ms Hua said the policies in Xinjiang “are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion, but about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism”. China claims that the rising numbers of violent terror attacks up to 2017 necessitated the use of the “training centres” for deradicalisation.\u0026nbspAnd the statement also touted various international bodies’ comments in support of China’s counter-terror policies, including favourable remarks made by the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation in March, as showing Beijing was backed by “the mainstream public opinion of the international community”.In reality, the situation in Xinjiang has ided the international community. UN human rights bodies have expressed repeated concerns and a group of mostly Western nations wrote a letter earlier this year calling for action to support the Uighurs.But other nations, mostly those with close economic ties to China and involvement in its “Belt and Road” infrastructure initiative, have asserted Beijing’s right to tackle what it calls a national security issue.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite what some of them think, Leave voters aren’t stupid and will see through their attempts to hoodwink them.”Sixteen of the  are Labour MPs seeking re-election, having defied voters in the past three years by voting to block, delay and derail Brexit on numerous occasions.Eight are in very heavy Leave areas where up to  per cent backed Brexit.They include high-profile figures such as the former Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, ex-minister Chris Bryant and former shadow Cabinet member Mary Creagh.In total,  General Election candidates have signed a pledge drawn up by the campaign group Remain Labour.It states: “Labour is committed to a confirmatory referendum, to give you the final say on Brexit. If elected as your Labour MP, I pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU.”By contrast, all  Tory candidates have promised to vote in favour of Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal.But many Labour hopefuls appear to be going back on their word to deliver the will of the people.Mrs Beckett,  defending her Derby South seat where . per cent voted Leave, had previously insisted she accepted the decision her constituents had made. She declared in May : “We have to make the best of it.”Another, Anna Turley — seeking re-election in Redcar where . per cent voted for Brexit — had said: “I will fight for a Brexit that is fair for Teesside”.Wakefield MP Ms Creagh, who declared before the referendum “ we vote to leave, there’s no going back”, is now of the firm belief there is.Jess Phillips has also signed the Remain Pledge despite assuring Birmingham Yardley voters in : “Sixty-odd per cent of constituents want us to leave. I cannot ignore that.”Labour campaign chiefs will this week launch a last-ditch blitz of “Red Wall” Leave-voting constituencies amid evidence working classes are rallying behind Boris Johnson to save Brexit.They face losing a swathe of seats in the north Midlands and Wales, with the biggest swing to Tories in Leave areas.Labour support in Grimsby, held by the party since , has now collapsed dramatically from  per cent in  to just  per cent.Tony Blair’s former seat of Sedgefield, which has not had a Tory MP since , is on BoJo’s target list.An overwhelming . per cent there voted to Leave and sitting MP Phil Wilson said in : “We respect their decisions and voted accordingly in Parliament in favour of Article .” Yet he has since put his name to the “Remain Pledge”.Ilford North’s Wes Streeting has also changed his stance since he said: “I voted to give the people a choice and I will abide by their decision.” Many Labour candidates who have not signed the pledge have barely tried to hide their derision for Leave voters.Sonya Ward, standing in Mansfield, mocked the . per cent who voted Leave there by claiming they “got it wrong, because they didn’t understand”.Tory chairman James Cleverly said last night: “This is a damning indictment of the very people these candidates want to represent, as well as the .million people who voted to leave in .“Despite pledging to respect the result of the referendum, Labour candidates have turned their backs on Brexit in favour of backing a second referendum and stopping Brexit altogether.”Former Labour leader Ed Miliband, defending the Brexit hotbed of Doncaster North, has not signed the pledge.He has been telling his constituents,   per cent Leave, that he voted for a Brexit deal nine times — but Tories pointed out he voted down Theresa May’s and Boris Johnson’s.His double-dealing exposes the scale of panic in Labour’s northern heartlands.Left-wing activist Owen Jones woke up to the Brexit backlash last week, admitting: “If Labour doesn’t do more to win back Leave voters in the North, Midlands and Wales, then Boris Johnson will win a majority.”One candidate revealed they clocked up  miles knocking on doors in their constituency.The source said: “Walking for six or seven hours a day is taking its toll especially in the cold.“People are picking up injuries and we’ve still got two weeks to go.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And  I understand the desire to let yourself off the leash. But it might be one of the few times you find yourself in the same room as your boss — with a chance to impress or ruin your career.You’ll be well aware we are living in the #MeToo era. And we all know, on occasions, it can go too far and that we shouldn’t all be frightened about exactly what we say and who to say it to.To allay your fears, my advice to you isyou want to dance with a colleague, ask her. If she says no then that’s your answer.Compliments are fine by the way. Us women love them , but think of your sister when giving them out.“You look great in that dress” is something you’d say to your sister, and “you look hot in that dress” isn’t.If you are looking at the month ahead and feeling overwhelmed already, this is really the only advice that you need: Start delegating.Write a list of all the jobs that need to be done and then allocate jobs to everyone over the age of ten.Getting your family to pull their weight is the best way to ensure that everyone has a happy Christmas.I know a lot of people dread the season, partly because they have to spend time with tricky in-laws.You can either not invite them  — why ruin your day   — or invite others too . Or just grin and bear it.Lastly,you are struggling with presents, please allow me to share the rules of our traditional Brady Family Christmas Present Game, played by the  members of our family on Christmas Day.Everyone buys four gts, having set a price limit: We have three at £, one at £.Wrap each one beautully so it’s impossible to distinguish premium from Primark. I once placed a roll of toilet paper with Donald Trump’s face on it in a Chanel gt bag — it was the hotly contended present everyone wanted that year . . . until they opened it.You place all gts on the table then take it in turns to throw a dice. When you get a six you pick anyone present you want . Keep throwing until all gts are distributed.Then throw six rounds with two dice and for every six you get you can pinch a present from anyone’s pile.And when it’s done you keep and open the presents you have won. It keeps us occupied for hours.I LOVED the photos of Kelly Brook in the Bahamas, where she is celebrating turning . What a great advert she is for the idea that le begins at !Kelly is naturally beautul with a big smile – and I think she looks absolutely amazing.“Lord Sugar couldn’t relate to me. That was the fundamental problem.“And I started getting that feeling from about week four.”The problem with interviews like this is that it puts her in danger of sounding a little bit like a sore loser.Oh, and also, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Lord Sugar doesn’t particularly like any of them at the moment.CONGRATULATIONS to builder Steve Thomson, , and his we Lenka, , who scooped the  £million EuroMillions jackpot.All their neighbours have said it couldn’t happen to a nicer couple. And I love the fact that the first thing they want to do with the money is given each of their three kids their own bedroom. This is a fairly humble ambition when you consider they are now one of the biggest British Lottery winners of all time.I also love the fact that Steve said he won’t stop working as a builder and will finish all his jobs before Christmas.He’s also already spelled out to his children thatthey want something “you’ll have to earn it”.All of which reveal an outlook that will stand him in very good stead indeed. It might just mean that he will be able to enjoy his win.The fact is money does change people. It also changes the way others see you. Most families will expect something and when they don’t get it will be angry. They will say things such as “we only want a car . . . it’s not much money for you, but would mean a lot to us”.They will expect you to share out your good fortune.My advice would be to think carefully about what to do with it before you make any rash decisions – and get a very good financial adviser.The problem with people who win a lot of money is that they often totally abandon all their values and spend, spend, spend. Let’s hope Steve and Lenka hold on to theirs.Yes, sure, I can see the temptation to magically get rid of the weight that inevitably comes when you have been, you know, growing another human being inside your body.But she only had a baby six weeks ago and,she waits a bit, she’ll probably just lose the baby weight naturally.In the meantime, yet another celeb demonstrates – and adds to – the pressure to “snap back” to their pre-pregnancy figure within weeks! Yes, your body is important but so is your mind!Six weeks after birth seems too soon to me.EVENit is true that the new Calornian craze of “butt sunning” gives you “surges of energy”, better sleep and “more creativity flowing through le”, which is what one devotee called Meagan promised on a recent Instagram post, I can’t see it catching on here.Meagan  says she has incorporated “perineum sunning” – which involves presenting the area between the anus and vulva to the sun – in to her “daily rising routine”.But talk about the sun shining out of your ar*e…what on earth must the neighbours think.ULRIKA JONSSON is on a dating app for people over   Good for her.

Labour has set out how it will end the cost of living crisis and save families an average £, a year by taking utilities into public ownership and raising the minimum wage. The Tories’ austerity cuts and failure to crack down on profiteering firms have cost the average household nearly £, a year since , according to Labour figures. As more and more children go homeless and hungry while executive pay and bonuses continue to rocket, Labour is vowing to end the unfairness of rip-off Britain.On Wednesday, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will say: “As Chancellor I want to ensure government has sound finances, but I want more than that. I want every family, every household in Britain to have sound finances. “That means putting a stop to rip-off Britain and making real change so that people are not powerless in the face of profiteering monopolies, bad bosses at work, and cast aside by a Government that just stands by. “You deserve better, and you will be better off under Labour. Where the Tories have failed, a Labour government will be on your side.”  The Conservatives have cost the average household £, every year since  because of rising bills and falling wages, Labour has calculated. This includes £, more on rent, £, extra on childcare per child and £, more on two rail season tickets. Labour claimed. The party says its plan for “real change” would save £, for each household, including £, per child clawed back on childcare under its plans to expand free care. Labour says £, would be saved on a pair of train season tickets by bringing the railways under public ownership.  Another £ would be pared back on utility bills by nationalising energy companies and upgrading homes. Labour’s plan to give free full-fibre internet with a nationalised broadband service would save £ a year, compared with a £ increase under the Tories. Mr McDonnell will highlight a report released by housing charity Shelter this week that suggests , children will be living in temporary accommodation on Christmas Day. And he will point to Equality Trust analysis saying the UK’s six richest people control as much wealth as the poorest  million.  Speaking in Birmingham, Mr McDonnell will say: “It’s three weeks to Christmas. With children going hungry and homeless are we really living up to the values of Christianity – or any other of our religions or beliefs for that matter ” Other Labour plans to tackle the squeeze on ordinary families include raising the minimum wage to £ an hour for everyone aged  and above, which it says would give the average over- a £, pay rise. Labour has said only the top % would have tax rises under its plans, but the Tories have pointed that out low earners would be affected by plans including the end to the marriage allowance, costing up to £ a year. They accused Labour of standing on a manesto containing tax hikes for “ordinary hard-working people”.    Since  the Tories have cost the average household: £ more for their dual-fuel energy bill £ more for their water bill £ more for their broadband bill £, more for season rail tickets £, more on average for childcare per child £ more on yearly prescription charges £, more on rent Total cost: £, Labouraposs household savings    Under Labour, the average household would save: £ on their dual-fuel energy bill £ on their water bill £ on their broadband bill £, on a pair of season rail tickets £, on average for childcare per child £ on yearly prescription charges £ on free school meals Total save: £, Where you will save Childcare  Average cost of child care rose £, from  to .

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Americans will take their decisions despite dismissing Labour claims that costs could soar in a UK-US trade deal.He added: I think itaposs hugely unlikely, why would they do that, whataposs the interest  Sky News host Adam Boulton replied: Well getting more money thataposs why. Labour claimed the exchange vindicated Jeremy Corbynaposs warnings that prices the NHS pays for key medicines could rise as part of a trade deal.In , UK pharmaceutical spending was £ per person while in the US it was £, according to the OECD. And leaked briefings last week showed UK officials had described drugs patents and costs as a key consideration going forward. It came as Donald Trump today insisted he wouldnapost demand access to the NHS in a post-Brexit trade deal evenyou handed it to us on a silver platter.Boris Johnson said he could categorically rule out that any part of the NHS will be on the table in any trade negotiations, including pharmaceuticals, adding: This is pure Loch Ness Monster, Bermuda Triangle stuff.But Labouraposs Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: Dominic Raab has finally admitted what we all know - Boris Johnson is opening the door to a Trump trade deal that will force our NHS bills through the roof. It could cost the NHS £ million a week which will mean more procedures cut, queues for care getting longer and fewer doctors and nurses. Mr Raab was questioned by Sky News after describing a UK-US trade deal as a win-win for business and shoppers, with cheaper prices in the shops. Interviewer Adam Boulton said: That means letting them have access to our markets, possibly even our health market, doesnapost it  Mr Raab replied: Not the health market. Weaposve ruled that out. The NHS is not up for grabs in any trade deal. We would walk away from a trade deal that suggested that was the case. But youaposre right, reducing barriers to trade on both sides is a win-win. It increases business activity, itaposs good for businesses and creating the jobs for the future, but it also gives the consumer a better deal because theyaposve got cheaper prices and greater choice. Mr Boulton pressed on: As I understand it, we canapost guarantee when we leave the EU that we will pay the same amount for American drugs in future, that they might decide to jack up the price, is that right  Mr Raab replied: Well look, the Americans will take their decisions, but what weaposre saying is -. Mr Boulton cut in: Which could be to jack up the price  Mr Raab replied: No, I think itaposs hugely unlikely, why would they do that, whataposs the interest -. To which Mr Boulton said: Well getting more money thataposs why. Tory Mr Raab said: Well no notyou reduce the amount, er, volume of purchase. But the key point in this is we will do the right thing by the patients, the consumers in this country and whether it comes to drug pricing or any other involvement of American firms that is not on the table for negotiation. It will be decided in this country, for the best interests of UK consumers and patients.It comes shortly after Mr Raab was skewered on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, where presenter Nick Robinson brought up a  book in which he and four other Tories called for more private providers in the NHS. Speaking as Donald Trump touched down in the UK for the NATO summit, Mr Raab told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I can tell you categorically Iaposve never advocated privatisation of the NHS. The aposhealthapos chapter of a book he co-authored in  said: “The current monolith should be broken up."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror champion working people","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Champion of working people Labour would reverse Tory failuresThe Tories are the party of the rich and are in the pockets of big business but Labour is on your side.

Would-be Chancellor John McDonnell’s promise to put more money into purses and wallets while improving public services we all rely would reverse nine years of Tory failures. Transforming the near £, he claims is the rip-off cost of the Tories into a £, Labour boost are calculations which will be picked over but there’s no dispute over which party represents the working classes. From a minimum wage worth at least £ an hour and scrapping callous Universal Credit to better buses and justice for pensioners, Labour is on your side. Behind a dishonest Brexit mantra the Tories and Boris Johnson have nothing to offer and they would tighten living standards. This election is getting very interesting. Sickening lies Donald Trump’s denial he has his eye on the NHS could be interpreted as confirmation it’s a target in any trade deal. Because the exact opposite of what the lying President says tends to be case and he is on record in June this year during a visit asserting everything would be on the table.  Boris Johnson trying to script, gag and shun his close associate from Washington is the mini-me desperately covering tracks when we all know that, should the Tories win this election, it would be Trump calling the shots. Trump taking voters for fools will backfire on a PM who once demanded patients be charged. Britons spot phonies a mile off.

Following a ten month long pay dispute UPS staff in Barton, Staffordshire have decided to strike. On December  HGV and shunter drivers employed by UPS at Argos’ flagship distribution centre will form a picket line, Birmingham Live reported. If an agreement over pay is not agreed, they will strike until December . The knock on effect for Christmas shoppers across the country could be signicant. The Barton site is a critical hub of Argos’ national network from which smart phones, laptops and televisions are shipped to regional Argos distribution centres for delivery to stores.Unite warned that without the shunter and HGV drivers to manoeuvre loads on and off the centre, work at the site would effectively grind to a halt, causing severe disruption to the Sainsbury’s owned chain. Rick Coyle, Unite regional officer, said: “Unite has been waiting for an offer in response to our members pay claim since March. Drivers and shunters have been treated with contempt and have had enough. “UPS is claiming that it has engaged with the pay claim. In reality, our members only received an offer of a voucher scheme that was so devoid of details that it could not be put to a ballot. “Our members do not want to cause disruption for Argos customers over the Christmas period, but they have been left with no choice but to strike. “The treatment of these Barton workers has been disgraceful. The reputations of UPS and Argos are at risk during the peak Christmas period because of this refusal to meaningfully engage with the pay claim.  “It is now up to UPS to ensure this dispute does not extend right across the busiest time of the year for Argos by tabling a sensible offer that our members can actually vote on.” The industrial action comes after a pay claim submitted in March by Unite on behalf of the workers was disregarded. Unite members nine to one in favour of strike action.

Donna, , who is a British Army officer, told The : “We’re overwhelmed to be honest, it’s blown up massively. “You get a lot of same-sex couples where one person is doing the whole thing, and the one person is getting pregnant and giving birth, whereas with this we’re both involved in a massive way. It’s definitely brought us closer together emotionally. We’re a close couple anyway but we both have a special bond with Otis as well which was helped by the way we’ve done it. “It’s my egg, and then they did the egg collection from me and then put it back into my body for  hours before being put into Jasmine’s body, and she became pregnant.” During the treatment one partner contributes and incubates the egg, and the other carries the foetus Jasmine, , gave birth on Sept  in Colchester, Essex, where the family live and the couple said that the procedure made them feel “equal in the whole process”  Jasmine said: The Anecova procedure has really made me and Donna feel equal in the whole process and has emotionally brought us closer together, we are a true family. If we had to go through the process again there is nothing we would change. Doctors claim it is the first time a baby had been grown in two wombs. Nick Macklon, medical director at the London hospital where Otis was born said: This is the first time this has been done. Itaposs very exciting because it means that for lesbian couples wanting to have babies together both of them can be involved in actively creating the embryo and then creating the baby.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry set up their page after their wedding, and have been delighting people with photos and videos ever since.And while many well-wishers just assume the account is run by a member of their staff, some eagle-eyed fans believe Meghan is the one at the keypad after spotting a big clue. One of their recent posts looks ahead to the Christmas, with the couple asking people to think of people in need over the Christmas period. But instead of saying Christmas, they say festive holiday season, a phrase more commonly used in the States. The post reads: With the festive holiday season upon us, it’s also a reminder to reflect on those in need – those who may feel lonely, hungry, homeless, or may be experiencing the holidays for the first time without loved ones. It’s an important time of year to help those around you who may be less fortunate, or who would appreciate even the smallest act of kindness. Continuing our monthly tradition of highlighting accounts that do good, and inspired by the “Twelve Days of Christmas” - we have selected twelve organisations caring for those in need - especially at this time of year.There are, thankfully, so many organisations around the world doing good on global and grassroots levels, many of which are not on Instagram . Check out the accounts we have chosen and please share those in your own communities that are making a dference. We would love to hear about the ones that inspire you - so please tell us and add your country’s flag! People praised Meghan and Harryaposs post and thanked them for sharing the message, and many people were quick to spot the American term. They believe itaposs a sign that the Duchess writes the posts herself. However some people werenapost as happy with the wording. One wrote: It’s Christmas please, not the ‘holiday season’ - that’s American. We are a Christian country and you have both been baptised and christened. I am very happy to honour others’ holidays but this, that we celebrate on th Dec is Christmas.  Another replied: Iaposm sorry but its called Christmas not festive holidays. Itaposs not the first time fans have spotted an Americanisms in the posts.Back in April the couple used the account to thank people for donating to charity as part of an unofficial baby shower and in lieu of gts for baby Archie.It references diapers instead of nappies, cribs instead of cots and backpacks instead of rucksacks.

That’s how Prince Andrew was described recently.But now Prince Andrew has a chance to showhe really is the moral man he’d have us believe. Andhe does have, as he told Emily Maitlis in that car-crash interview, “a tendency to be too honourable”, then now’s the time to show it. This morning more than  flights will leave London for New York. Andrew could be on any one of themhe wanted to get over there, sit down with FBI officers investigating his mate Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking, tell his version of the friendship with a convicted paedophile, and clear his name for good. And yet, and yet I bet my mortgage he won’t be doing any of that. Most likely, despite his protestations that he’ll be happy to help the FBI, I’ll bet he will be dragged across the Atlantic kicking his golden feet. For the evidence against the Queen’s favourite son is mounting. Lisa Bloom, lawyer for victims of Epstein, told This Morning yesterday that she has a woman who claims she “vividly remembers” seeing Andrew in the Tramp nightclub with Virginia Roberts – the woman kept as a sex slave by Epstein. This is crucial. For in the Maitlis interview Andrew said he was “convinced that I was never in Tramp’s” with her. He reckoned he’d spent the day playing happy families at Pizza Express with his daughters before ing home with them because Fergie was away. Throughout the disastrous interview he stuck to his line that he had no recollection of meeting Virginia and denied ever having sex with her, saying: “I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.” Yet in her Panorama interview this week, Virginia told of quite clear memories. As she said with shocking openness: “One thing that I can tell you is you never forget the face of someone who has heaved over you.” It’s impossible for us to know who is lying and who is telling the truth. But to the casual observer one certainly seems far more compelling in their account.

Sweeping the floors, polishing the counter and replacing stocks on the shelves are all part of his duties as the busy boy is also on hand to deal with customers - all with a friendly smile and big thumbs up.  The commercial - which features four generations of Tomaposs family - has a special twist at the end withArthur shutting up shop before carrying home a Christmas tree. It features a cover of Alphavilleaposs  hit aposForever Youngapos, performed by American singer-songwriter Andrea von Kampen. It is the third year in a row that Hafod Hardware, which opened in  and is one of the oldest businesses in the town, have released a Christmas advert.  The previous commercials have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times to huge acclaim and Tom is again hoping to once again put a smile on peopleaposs faces. Tom, , said: The aim is to make it the best Christmas advert of the year. The comments weaposve had so far have been amazing.  Making this video with my son has been an experience I will cherish for a letime. They say never work with animals or children but he was a joy. Heaposs such a bright boy and I would be lyingI said it was dficult to get him to perform on screen.  He often comes to visit me in the shop, so werenapost really asking him to do anything he hadnapost done before. Whenever I watch the advert, it makes me well up with pride. Forever Young was the song I really wanted. I asked Andreashe could do a cover and she was happy to do it. She recorded it in a studio and paid  for a sound engineer. I said weaposd pay - so thataposs all the advert has cost us. Sheaposs got an incredible voice, itaposs perfect for the advert. All three adverts touch upon the signicance of family at Christmas and so it was extremely important to me that Arthur had a role in each one.  Showing the transition of him as a young baby in the first advert, through to the young man he is today, really does capture the essence of what we have been trying to create. We are told every year that Christmas is for kids, but thereaposs nothing stopping us all from being big kids at Christmas. All the time, people are coming into the shop and asking us about our Christmas adverts. Even strangers pop in to say theyaposve seen them. People are always asking whether we were doing another one this year. Itaposs hard to say no, we feel obliged to do it.  The locals love them. Itaposs nice to think we can put a lot of smiles on peopleaposs faces in the community. Itaposs always nice to do something for the town. People always compare our videos to the likes of John Lewis and we try to get the same message across as the mutli-million pound adverts do. But there is an underlying message. We are just a small independent shop in Mid Wales trying to compete with the big boys like John Lewis and MS.

Friends have spoken of their devastating loss after the body of the missing mum-of-one was found this week. Holly Capron, who had a two-year-old son, was reported missing to police on Monday, November , after friends reported she made distressed calls. She was last heard from when she rang friends while at an Exeter park alone, and was reported as being obviously aposdistraughtapos.Tragically, the mumaposs body was found at St Mary’s Bay at around .am on Sunday, reports Devon Live .Just weeks before her death she had launched a mental health support group on Facebook. Holly was a part-time model who grew up in Newton Abbot and lived in Plymouth before moving to Exeter about a year ago. She worked part-time as a model and recently also worked for Devon Clfs in Exmouth. The tragic news of her death has come as a shock to her close friends who are trying to come to terms with the sudden loss. Sophie Bowlas, , of Plymouth, met Holly a few years ago while working together on a photo shoot and remained friends since.  She said: “I think Holly started modelling when she was about . She was a little pocket rocket who was full of energy and le. She was always smiling and laughing, even when le was hard. “There was never a dull moment when she was around, and her messages where always entertaining.  “She was very out there character and was a wild child, but a good wild child. She loved gigs, raves and going to music festivals. “She dressed a bit like a punk rocker and loved bright colours. She also loved her hair being braided and having pink in her hair. “She really loved her little boy.”  Sophie said Holly had gone missing in the past, but only ever for one or two days, and had a history of mental health illness. “To go missing for that long was completely out of character,” she said. “It’s been a shock to everyone, especially right on top of Christmas. It’s her family I feel for.“Two weeks ago we were talking through Facebook and planning to do another shoot. To look at and to speak to you would think she was outgoing and bubbly, but you never know what’s going on in someone’s end.“She had many friends and everyone loved her. She will be missed by many people.” Photographer Tony Pattinson was also one of Holly’s close friends. Tony, of Plymouth, said: “We have been friends for the best part of  years and met through her modelling. She was a fantastic model and really enjoyed it. She had an alternative look. “She was full of le and fun, and very much a free spirit. She was a real tonic to be around, and was very loving and caring. “She adored her son Stanton and was a fantastic mum. “Unfortunately at times she was plagued by demons, and there was always the possibility that she might do something.” Friend and model Cherish Metters, , of Plymouth said: Tony made us the models we are today. I met Holly though him and we always had close sisterhood friendship. She was a firecracker and kept everyone on their toes.

She will contradict his claim that he was at home with his daughters after a trip to a Pizza Express on the night he is alleged to have had sex with the -year-old. Lisa Bloom, representing some victims of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, said she will take the unnamed woman to the FBI. The US lawyer was in London yesterday hoping to talk to Andrew about his friendship with the billionaire financier, who killed himself in jail aged  in August. Virginia, now  with the surname Giuffre, claims she was forced by Epstein to have sex with Andrew at the London home of pal Ghislaine Maxwell in March  after dancing with the prince at Tramp nightclub. In last month’s BBC Newsnight interview Andrew, , denied they had sex and said he was not at the club that night. He has vehemently denied all Ms Giuffre’s claims against him. But Ms Bloom said: “I’m representing a witness who says she was there. She saw Prince Andrew with Virginia, remembers it vividly because she was told this is a member of the Royal Family.  “It was a very big thing for her. She saw Virginia there with him. I’m going to take her to the FBI.” In a direct message to Andrew she said on ITV’s This Morning: “You’ve said you’re going to cooperate, let’s do it. Don’t make us subpoena you. Don’t make law enforcement chase you. Come to the US, sit down with the FBI and attorneys and answer questions. Give us the documents, calendars, journals... and have staff who travel with you answer questions as well.” It came as Virginia’s dad Sky Roberts said he had “no doubt” she is telling the truth about Andrew.

The mouth-watering meal is put together by her Swedish husband, Johan, leaving her with just a potato dish to make. And all her family are around her, including her son, Jonathan, who rushes back from his sht as a junior doctor ready for his birthday on Christmas Day. But while surrounded by all that joy, the Call The Midwe star can’t help thinking about those less fortunate than her – especially young homeless people. She says: “My husband is Swedish so we have a great family get-together on the th. Then on Christmas Day we have an evening meal and I’ll probably watch Call The Midwe, even though I’ve seen it already. “My son, Jonathan, was actually born five weeks early on Christmas Day. I’ve tried to pass my ethos towards charity work down to him. When you’re aware of how much you have yourself, you need to be aware of what’s going on around you and how you can help.” Family is something that has always been very important to -year-old Jenny, whose father was in the Army. “I feel extraordinarily lucky to have had a very tight family background,” she says. “We were always on the move so the important thing was this small family unit. I had my brother and parents, and that was it. But it gave me a huge amount of support. “When I moved to London I couldn’t help being terribly aware of people on the streets, particularly very young people. Any chance to give the same support I had felt right.” Jenny has now been working with Action For Children to help prevent youth homelessness for  years. She is supporting our Give Kids a Cracking Christmas campaign to raise funds for the charity. Jenny believes the twinkling lights and frosty nights of Christmas can be the most challenging time of year on the streets.  Jenny says: “It’s incredibly hard. There’s all this fuss and lights everywhere and people rustling round with parcels in their hands, it’s a terrible contrast between the two. “The nights are very long – it’s dark from pm until the next morning at am or am. And anyone on the street will tell you that they never sleep because they’re never sure what might happen to them, people abusing them, kicking them and stealing from them.” Jenny, who starred in The Railway Children as a child, earned an OBE for he charity work in . She is stunned by the amount of work that still needs to be done to end youth homelessness. She has spent a night on the street almost every year since  to raise money for Action For Children’s annual Byte Night, and has been joined by celebrities such as golfer Nick Faldo. “One time we slept out on the South Bank [in London],” she says. “It’s cold and it’s damp and at times it was wet and they had St John’s Ambulance people with us all night. “They were actually waking us up because hypothermia can happen very quickly.  “In the morning you get a breakfast roll and you go home feeling shattered. “But you get a shower and make yourself comfortable and it’s at that point that you think,I was homeless, I would not be able to do this. It’s really bad and it’s worth doing something about.” Jenny is urging politicians to think about how they can prevent people ending up sleeping rough. She says: “Politicians should be focusing on education and social care to make sure people don’t fall into the situation where a child runs away or is not cared for. “There are so many things that people can do – making sure information is being passed down between teachers, police and social services, so they can watch out for problems. There also needs to be better handling of social care within families. Usually the root cause of youth homelessness is families falling apart – whether that’s because of abuse, economic or social problems.”  Because of this, Jenny was thrilled when Call The Midwe decided to cover the issue of child abuse in its Christmas episode two years ago. Her character, Sister Julienne, helped to reconcile a family who had been torn apart by an abusive father. Jenny admits: “It was a dficult story and I was very touched to be involved with it, because it echoed a lot of things that I really do care deeply about.” Jenny has recently been busy filming the latest Christmas special of the BBC show, which was shot in the Outer Hebrides. “It’s a very particular Christmas special,” she says. “It was really cold but it was so beautul. Miriam Margolyes [who is guest-starring as Sister Mildred this year] and I were up by these extraordinary locations with these standing stones but we could hardly hear each other because the wind was so high and the rain was going straight into our faces, so we could hardly see.  “We were getting drenched really fast and we had nowhere to change because we were miles away from anything. “I have a picture of Miriam covered in plastics and people around her trying to keep her protected and me in raincoats and the rest of it. We just wanted to try and do it as quickly as we possibly could. But it was beautul and wild and rugged. It was very dferent to Poplar.” Jenny hopes the feel-good show continues for many years to come. She says: “I’ve been in Call The Midwe for nearly a decade now and one of the reasons for this is that it’s just such a lovely group of people to work with. You get good stories, good production team, good actors and good food.” She will once again count her blessings as she settles down with her family for Christmas, and think of those less fortunate.

They today laid out their impeachment case against in a -page document accusing the world leader of abusing his power by pressuring Ukraine to help him in the  Presidential election, then hampering efforts to investigate. The impeachment report was released as across the Atlantic Mr Trump mingles with world leaders including the Queen and Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the middle of his three-day whirlwind visit to London for a NATO Summit. The report by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives accuse Mr Trump of using the powers of his office to solicit foreign interference in the  election. He moved quickly to reject the congressional inquiry, telling reporters in London it was a bad thing for our country. Iaposm not even thinking about it, he said, according to the BBC .  I think itaposs very unpatriotic for the Democrats to put on a performance where they do that. I do. I think itaposs a bad thing for our country. Impeachment wasnapost supposed to be used that way. The Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, which has spearheaded the impeachment probe that formally began in September, also said in the report that the Republican president had obstructed the investigation. The report outlines findings from a series of public hearings and behind-closed-doors interviews conducted by impeachment investigators since September folllowing a whistleblower complaint.  The complaint centres on an allegation that Mr Trump tried to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Biden, who announced he would run for the  Presidential election in April, is one of the highest profile candidates in the race after serving as VP to Barack Obama. The impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schf wrote in the report unveiled today. [T]he President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security, he continued.  Lawmakers and the public have heard testimony from current and former officials that military aid was withheld from Ukraine.  They have also heard that a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was conditioned on Kiev conducting the probe as well as one into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine interference in the  U.S. election. But the Republicans have accused their Democrat rivals of staging a partisan attack as they released their own report on Monday.  The party argued that Democrats had not proved evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor. The committee is scheduled to meet later tonightto vote on its findings, as Mr Trump attends a drinks reception at Buckingham Palace with the Queen and NATO world leaders, before moving to Downing Street to an event hosted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson . The matter will then go to the House Judiciary Committee, which will open its proceedings on Wednesday. If the full House eventually votes to approve formal impeachment charges, a trial would be held in the Republican-led U.S. Senate.

The billionaire Tesla CEO is on trial for alleged defamation against British cave ing hero Vernon Unsworth in the days following the rescue of boys from a flooded cave in Thailand. Musk told a packed court in Los Angeles that his message was not meant to be taken literally and was in response to an unprovoked insult from the Brit. The tech entrepreneur also apologised to Unsworth from the witness stand. Unsworth sued Musk in September , two months after playing a leading role in the rescue of the  boys and their soccer coach from the flooded Tham Luang Nang Non cave. A jury of three men and five women will consider whether Unsworth is entitled to unspecied punitive and other money damages from Musk, , over pedo guy and other tweets. The episode began after Musk offered a mini-submarine from his SpaceX rocket company to help with the cave rescue. Unsworth had gone on CNN on July , , three days after the rescue was completed, belittling the offer as a PR stunt and saying Musk could stick his submarine where it hurts. Two days later, Musk lashed out at Unsworth in a series of tweets, including by calling him a pedo guy.  Unsworth has called the slur a lie that harmed his reputation. Musk was the first witness called to testy by Unsworthaposs lawyers after opening statements were read. He said he was merely responding in kind to Unsworthaposs remarks, a video of which Musk said he watched on Twitter. Those comments were an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids, he said. It was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back. I thought hewas just some random creepy guy.  Musk added: I thought at the time that he was unrelated to the rescue. Pressed under questioning by lawyer Lin Wood, Musk testied that he did not mean for his tweet about Unsworth to be taken literally. I assume he did not mean to sodomise me with a submarine ... Just as I didnapost literally mean he was a paedophile, he said. Looking directly at the plaintf, Musk said: I apologised in a tweet and again in thedeposition, and Iaposll say it again - I apologise to Mr Unsworth. Unsworth sat stone-faced through Muskaposs testimony. Musk had previously apologised for his pedo guy comment, saying the term was a common insult in South Africa where he grew up.  The billionaire was expected toto the witness stand on Wednesday for more questioning by his own lawyers. The trial before US District Judge Stephen Wilson in Los  Angeles is expected to last about five days. The judge has explained the case hinges on whether a reasonable person would take Muskaposs Twitter statement to mean that he was calling Unsworth a paedophile. To win the defamation case, Unsworth needs to show that Musk was negligent in publishing a hood that clearly identied the plaintf and caused him harm.Actual malice on Muskaposs part does not need to be proven because the judge has deemed Unsworth a private inidual rather than a public figure.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who was diagnosed with cancer when she was just  was shocked to be told she had more than  tumours in her lungs. Year six teacher Ashley Wyss from Ohio in the US, has refused to find out her prognosis because she doesnapost want to live in fear. The now -year-old has told how she woke up one morning in  to find a lump at the front of her neck. At first she assumed her glands were swollen, but when the inflammation didnapost go away, she went to the doctor to get it checked. Her blood tests ed a normal result, but an ultrasound revealed Ashley had medullary thyroid cancer.  She immediately had surgery to remove her thyroid as well as  lymph nodes, ridding her body of cancer. But unfortunately, in  the cancer ed, and  more lymph nodes were removed - half of which were cancerous. Cancer has continued to derail Ashleyaposs health ever since. In , the cancer spread from her neck to her lungs, and by  there were more than  tumours in her lungs. The extremity of the metastasis meant Ashley had to start oral chemotherapy, but the strength of it would leave Ashley needing treatment for the rest of her le - despite being only .  Despite her young age, Ashley and her husband Ryan, , have found themselves navigating harvesting embryos, surrogacy options, and going through the menopause. For two years she went through three dferent chemotherapies, battling side effects including mouth sores, rashes, hair loss, nausea and fatigue. The cancer continued to spread and is now also in Ashleyaposs right eye, brain, spine, hips and liver. A tumour in Ashleyaposs spine fractured her T vertebrae, requiring surgery to remove the vertebrae and insert two metal rods to stabilise her spine. She has since undergone radiation to her hips, spine and brain to shrink the tumours. As she tries to maintain a positive outlook, Ashley refuses to question her prognosis because she wants to live in the present instead of living in fear.  She believes that her positivity, health and fitness have helped her get to where she is now. Ashley said of her diagnosis: It was definitely a shock, but I felt like I needed to be the strong one for my parents and friends since I was so young. She was devastated when the cancer kept ing, year after year. I felt defeated because I assumed the surgeries would be enough, and that it would stay in my neck and not metastasise to anywhere . Ashley said the tumours in her lungs made it dficult to breathe, so she had no choice but to go through the oral chemotherapy which she will have to do for the rest of her le. Because of that, she decided to go through IVF at the age of  to harvest nine embryos with her husband.  She said: Starting treatment also meant I wouldnapost be able to carry our children one day, so instead we have to use a surrogate. I went through IVF and the day after completing it, I began chemotherapy. Going through IVF and finding out I would never be able to carry our children was harder to deal with than finding out I had cancer. I always dreamed of being a mum, having the opportunity to get pregnant and surprising my husband and family. Cancer took that opportunity away. Ashley said her chemotherapy left her miserable and she slept for most of the day. I worked, came home to take a nap, had dinner and spent about an hour with my husband before going back to bed. On the weekends, I slept for  hours and had a four-hour nap during the day. Looking back, I donapost know how I was able to work full time! Not one to live in fear, Ashley hasnapost asked any doctors what her prognosis is because she believes that she has been given this battle to help others and to show that you can find good in any situation.  In , she began a new clinical trial offered at her hospital to try a new drug called Loxo . She was one of the first  patients in the US to try it, and claims it has shrunk her cancer in half sin the first year. It was the best I had felt in years, and finally felt like I was living a normal le, said Ashley. However, last year her tumours began to grow again. A tumour in Ashleyaposs spine fractured a vertebrae, and this May it broke through the area that surrounded my spinal cord. The following month she underwent major surgery to remove half of the vertebrae, as much of the tumour as possible, and had two rods inserted in her spine.  She then had radiation treatment targeting her spine to get rid of any remaining tumour.But in September, the tumour in her brain grew and she began having migraines and headaches frequently, so underwent more radiation treatment to the tumour in her brain.As of October , Iaposm back on my clinical trial and feeling great. Iaposm back to school teaching and have a side business as a health and fitness influencer. I believe that my positive attitude and love of fitness has helped me get to where I am today. I wholeheartedly believe that without my positivity, I would have let cancer win a long time ago.  Iaposve never asked what my prognosis is, and itaposs not something I will ask. Iaposm all about living in the present and taking each day as it comes. Iaposd rather not worry about the future and the aposwhat s!apos I surround myself with positive people and try to focus on the positives. I allow myself time to process and feel sad about a situation, but I donapost allow myself to stay in that headspace. With everything that has happened, I could easily be in a really dark place.

Shaun Byrne was on the bench.The Dark Blues made much of the early running, dominating possession but struggling to find a way through a packed Doonhamers defence.Attacks from the visitors were few and far between but there was a warning of what was to come from Dobbie as he forced Hamilton into a save on  minutes.Thirteen minutes later he gave the goalkeeper no chance after nipping away from Jordan McGhee and Robertson before rattling a low effort into the corner from  yards to make it -.Dundee were still in control of possession but Queens continued to hit on the break and El Bakhtaoui had the chance to double their lead on  minutes as he sped through but hit straight at Hamilton.With Queens goalie Robby McCrorie untested, McPake threw on striker Danny Johnson to partner Kane Hemmings as Jamie Ness limped off before the break.After the break, a mix up between Sean Mackie and McGhee gave Connor Murray a free look at goal but the winger fired just wide before El Bakhtaoui stung the fingertips of Hamilton.Finally the Dark Blues gave McCrorie some work to do on  minutes and it looked like they#d found the equaliser through Hemmings# low shot but the goalie gathered at the third attempt.That didn#t spark le into the display, however, as Dundee continued to struggle to break the Doonhamers down.They finally did, however, after  minutes as Johnson found the top corner with a super strike.Seconds later that was undone as, straight from the kick-off, Dobbie pinched the ball off Forster to win the game for his side and see boos ring out at full-time from the home support.Dundee: Hamilton, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Mackie, Ness , Robertson , Todd, McDaid, Dorrans, Hemmings.Unused subs: Ferrie, Byrne, McPake, Strachan, Cunningham.Queens: McCrorie, Mercer, Holt, Brownlie, Kilday, Pybus, Murray , Dobbie, Osman, Lyon, El Bakhtaoui.Unused subs: Leighfield, Gourlay, Irving, McCarthy, Kidd, Oliver.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/12/KMil_Euros-3.jpg ","title":"dundee skaters record a magnificent one two three in british nationals","story":"Day four at the British Figure Skating Championships was a great success for Dundee skaters.Natasha McKay, Karly Robertson and Danielle Harrison all delivered superb performances ranking them first, second and third in the Senior Ladies event.They already had great performances in the Short Program lying one, two, three going into the Free Program.Natasha won her fourth consecutive British Championship Senior Ladies title.She was first of the trio to skate and performed flawlessly.Her artistry combined with her jumping elements puts her amongst the best in the world.Natasha earned . points in the Free Program and won the competition with a combined total score of ..

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter halloween at pony club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHarry Potter was the theme for this year’s Hallowe’en Fun Day organised by Argyll South Pony Club at the Long Walk arena near Kilmartin.Even the judges # Ulla Riddell and Mary Lou Aitchison – got into the spirit of the day by dressing as Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

When we see inaccuracies, we must challenge them not least because mainstream media often take erroneous claims like this as being the truth.#We challenged the claims on this poster about the livestock sector’s contribution to greenhouse gas emission because they were clearly inaccurate and we provided UK and Scottish Government statistics to the ASA to prove our point.#We welcome the steps taken by ASA and would not hesitate to make similar complaints in the future, however, ASA must consider the time-frame in which it responds to official complaints.#With our evidence and grievance lodged in June, posters continued to be seen by our members in Edinburgh and Glasgow until only a few weeks ago.  While the organisation has now agreed to remove the posters, their damaging and inaccurate messaging has been visible throughout this period.#We urge our members to continue to bring  claims to our attention and we will act, where we can, on their behalf.#"},{"url":null,"title":"star off the mark with derby win","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star made the relatively short trip to Cowal on Saturday November  to play Dunoon Ams in a match rearranged from the previous weekend.And it was the Lochgilphead side who ed home with the three points after a much improved performance.Star opened the scoring after  minutes when a James McGuinness corner caused confusion in the Dunoon defence, resulting in the ball ending up in the back of the net.Dunoon tried to respond but Star#s back three of Ben Forbes, Kyle Selfridge and Coll McCallum never looked troubled.

In keeping these candles burning for extended periods, the inidual prayer is believed to be prolonged and amplied along with the intentions of other believers’ prayers.In doing this, a collective spirit of prayer for the entire church is established which is encouraging, enriching and empowering."},{"url":null,"title":"finishing-touches-earlstons-big-christmas-switch-on","story":"VOLUNTEERS

The success of this flight was the impetus for pioneer flights from London to Australia and Cape Town and it is the former that is my subject.In May  the Australian government offered a prize of poundA, for the first Australians in a British aircraft to fly from Great Britain to Australia. In November  six entries started the race. Only two of these reached their final destination the other four crashed in Surbiton, Corfu, Crete and Bali .Of the two flights that succeeded, the clear winners were Ross and Keith Smith they piloted a Vickers Vimy aeroplane and were joined by two mechanics, Wally Shiers and Jim Bennett. Their flight left Hounslow on November ,  and after  days and , miles they arrived at Darwin on December  stops included Lyon, Rome, Cairo, Damascus, Basra, Karachi, Delhi, Calcutta, Rangoon, Singora, Singapore, Batavia and Surabaya. This compares with just under four weeks that it took my grandparents to sail to Perth when they emigrated from Edinburgh to seek a new le in Australia in  with help from the Assisted Passage Scheme.Pilot Ross Smith had flown for T E Lawrence during the First World War and in  he flew the first pioneering flight from Cairo to Calcutta which must have helped the record breaking journey the following year. The Smith brothers received knighthoods and the four members of the crew shared the prize of poundA,. The runners up, who left London on January ,  took  days to reach Darwin, arriving in August . These two flights compare with the recent ldquoworldrsquos longest flight -  hour non-stop from New York to Sydney.The two Smith brothers received a congratulatory telegram from the headmaster of small Scottish school,ldquoWell done Ross and Keith Warriston proud of you Mr F W Gardner headmaster.F Gardner was the headmaster of Warriston School in Moffat where the Smith brothers ndash and their sibling Colin ndash had spent the final two years of their education.Ross and Keith Smith both had the middle name of their mother ldquoMacpherson she was the daughter of an immigrant family from Scotland. Their father had been born in Moffat and emigrated to Western Australia, and in sending their three sons to Moffat to complete their education they were clearly strengthening their bonds with ldquothe old country.The Smith brothers were therefore grounded in Scotland.A well-known fact in the world of cricket is that the famous Australian all-rounder Keith Millerwas named after the two Smith brothers his parents named him Keith Ross Miller. It is not known whether Keith Miller realised that the Smith brothers had Scottish ancestry, but as he played wartime cricket matches in Scotland and visited again in  it is nice to speculate. Millerrsquos wartime service as a mosquito pilot adds a certain symmetry to the achievements of his distinguished namesakes.When he was in Scotland in  playing for the RAAF, Miller lodged with the McVey family in Clovenfords and when he ed with ldquoThe Invincibles in  he planted a tree in Selkirk and called in on the family to renew his acquaintance.In  I paid a visit to Selkirk to seeI could see the tree planted by Miller but was told it had been destroyed in a storm - this story came full circle when I recently spoke to Hazel McLean who used to live in Clovenfords and had met Keith Miller in  when he called on the McVeys.She recalled being taken by her parents to their friendsrsquo house nearby and the excitement in getting his autograph.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually.

problems with an external roof pipe at his Galashiels property almost a year ago on December .Further problems developed after a new bathroom suite was fitted at his Talisman Avenue home during the summer.And it was only when wallpaper began peeling off his walls that action was finally taken to stop the dampness.Despite being issued with a dehumidier the former gamekeepers property is still

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

resulting in  job losses, while turbine manufacturer CS Wind UK could make  of its  employees redundant.Councillor Morton has also written to Paul Wheelhouse, Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Michael Matheson, Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, and other Scottish ministers in relation to the CS Wind situation, asking them to identy #any particular means of supporting the company in its endeavours to keep production costs as low as possible#.She said: #Given the seriousness of the situation I have been in regular correspondence with Scottish ministers about this, seeking urgent national intervention on a Team Scotland basis, to support the already fragile Kintyre economy.#Talking about First Milk#s decision to close Campbeltown Creamery, Councillor Morton said: #A key issue was the inability to secure a future customer base for Kintyre cheese at a sustainable price that s a profit.#The effects of the global economy and ongoing pressure to reduce costs have also been signicant factors in the production of a bulk cheese product and this is also reflected across the entire UK dairy industry.#First Milk has provided reassurances in the short term, at least, that milk being produced by Kintyre’s  dairy farms will continue to be bought and transported from Kintyre without an additional haulage charge.#However, the longer term sustainability of the Kintyre milk field is now under threat, which is a signicant issue for the Kintyre economy, given this milk field directly supports the livelihoods of  people in Kintyre.#She said that in addition to a Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative which has been led by Skills Development Scotland with support from Business Gateway, council staff will do #everything that is possible# to support affected workers, adding: #There is now a compelling need for national intervention at this time given the current and potential impact on the Kintyre economy.#Cllr Morton said that the situation was #further exacerbated# by the situation at CS Wind, adding: #All efforts are being made to assist the company in securing new orders but this is a highly competitive, global market place with, again, constant pressure to lower production costs.#It is particularly disappointing to see this happen given recent investment in both the factory and

Itrsquos getting busy these days, often with families, which is great to see. Even still there is enough space amidst the trees to quickly find solitudeyou need it.I can never visit this wonderful place without whispering a word of thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson for his role, along with others, in saving this precious and magical wood, which my family has almost literally grown up in.I have got to know Gregor, who still lives in East Lothian, and the world is made a better place by caring and thoughtful people like him.We arrived at the wood in late afternoon, knowing that we wouldnrsquot have a lot of time before nightfall. The ground was literally carpeted with orange and yellow, and autumn colours still hung on the trees.But there was a nip in the air a cold crisp reminder that summer is now long gone and the fingers of winter are about to grip us. So we kept on the move to keep warm.As we ventured deeper into the wood I noticed something. ldquoStop, I said to the kids, ldquoand listen.There was not a breath of wind, it was deathly still. The trees stood in absolute silence. I couldnrsquot even hear any traffic, or the usual distant murmurings of modern day le. There was no noise, only the sound of nature.Bird song was above us. I was surprised to hear such a chorus on a late autumn afternoon.We stood, listening. It was asthe birds were suddenly singing for us, and the children were genuinely enthralled, as was I.We decided to continue our walk, but our mood had now changed. The silence could have been eerie but it wasnrsquot, it heightened our awareness that the wood had le we couldnrsquot see.It was asour inner senses had been aroused. The kids wanted to walk silently, so they could continue to listen. So we practised ldquowalking like a Native American hunter as taught to us by Chris Yule, another East Lothian environmental luminary.We crept through the wood, looking for deer, and faeries, now acutely aware of any faint sound that the absence of noise made possible to hear.Finally we reached our favourite place, and sat, still listening. I have to tell you, seeing my two youngest being so quiet for so long was a unique experience.Then it began to get dark, and the bird song faded away.We headed back to the car as the trees turned into shadows. But we still stopped every now and then to listen and peer into the undergrowth. We were convinced at one point we could see a deer hiding from us.We got to the car as the last glimmering light in the sky vanished, and the moon came out from behind the clouds. It was a magical experience, not a scary one. Wersquod had an unexpected connection with nature, that wasnrsquot visual, but something deeper.I turned the engine on, breaking the silence, and we ed to our world of articial light and constant noise. But the whole walk had had a meditative effect on us, and I reflected on the fact that we are replacing sound with noise, and we are the poorer for that.We are so constantly surrounded by human made sounds that we donrsquot notice it. The noise has become the background to our lives. Few of us probably reflect that we need to connect to the sounds of nature anymore, or true silence itself.Our inner selves do however. Call it what you will, our soul, our spiritual self, our primeval awareness. The truth is we need the absence of noise every now and then so the sounds of nature can be heard. It replenishes us, reminds us who we really are, and lts our mental health. No matter how much we pave nature over with cement, we cannot avoid the fact we are part of it and need it.Yet, we are increasingly separated from it, including the sounds and the silence that comes with the absence of our noise. Is there a connection between this and the mental health crisis we now face The neon lights of a shopping centre, and the constant buzz and noise we fill our everyday lives with may seem like progress, but it isnrsquot for our well being. We need places where such noise is absent ndash where only nature is heard. No, actually, we need many more of these places, but sadly we are going in the reverse direction destroying the ones that survive."},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-family-return-italian-roots-open-food-lovers-paradise","story":"They have restored the home of their ancestors in Picinisco in Lazio, Italy, and turned it into a holiday destination complete with a boutique hotel, cookery school and winery.Members of the Di Ciacca family moved to Cockenzie  years ago and Cesido Di Ciacca took over The Cockenzie Cafe, a cafe, fish  chip shop and ice-cream shop, in .The family lived above the shop on  High Street and integrated themselves into the community.

Hersquod not always been homeless, of course, but people rarely see the person behind the label.The one good thing about winter for him was the approach of Christmas. Peoplersquos consciences seemed to be more sensitive at Christmas time.He was an alcoholic and he blamed himself every day for what he was. But this just fed his sense of worthlessness and kept the cycle going. His earlier le, the lsquonormal onersquo with his we and children, was now a long time ago, but when he slumbered he often re-entered it in his dreams.Especially that last family Christmas, when they were all together. He would re-run that time in his mind, just like his we would watch The Devil Wears Prada over and over and never tire of it. Yes, when he closed his eyes it could seem he was there again.But when he came to his senses, he came back to himself: an unloved man, old before his time, who people ignored and passed in the street without looking at. He usually felt completely invisible. To be fair, some people did stop and talk, usually the same ones.Perhaps they never truly understood just how valued those moments were.He understood it, after all he despised himself, so how could he expect others to feel dferently.Alcohol seemed to be his one real friend, the only one to understand and ease his pain.But St Andrewrsquos Day was approaching and this was his cue to get completely sober.He would feel that tingle inside that people call lsquofeeling Christmassyrsquo. It was a painful, bittersweet emotion for John, and his friend alcohol always offered to help. But he would close his eyes and be strong.It was the one thing in his le where he felt he had not let people down.So he would summon all his strength and draw on who he used to be for those last vestiges of self-belief and refuse the offer of help from his destructive friend.He made it and arrived at the door of the managerrsquos office, clean, sober and ready to work.The manager had no idea John was the same man he passed on a daily basis on the street outside.Admittedly, he did look dferent now, butthe manager had ever paused to look at John or speak to him, then he would surely recognise him. But for once he was glad of his invisibility. If the manager had ever recognised him outside then John would probably lose his job.ldquoYour costume is in the back room. You start in  minutes, said the manager.ldquoThe paperwork came through last week so yoursquore set to go.John knew the routine and got changed.When he sat in his chair, he was transformed. He was Santa.For the next five weeks, he knew he was going to be noticed and even loved. People would speak to him in a kind and almost reverent way, ask him how he was. His beard and red suit wiped away his sense of worthlessness.All that day, families came and he spoke to more people in that one day being Santa than he did the rest of the year being himself.Afterwards, he headed back to the hostel with money in his pocket.His old friend whispered in his ear: ldquoSpend it on me, spend it on me.ldquoMaybe later, but not now, John replied in his head.But the hostel was full and he couldnrsquot find any other place.And so he knew hersquod have to spend a bitter night on the streets.The food van would arrive soon, so he decided to wait for it in the busy centre.As he sat, a young girl came up to him.She just stood and stared. John recognised her.She had been one of the children in his grotto earlier and suddenly a fear gripped him: she might recognise who he really was.ldquoCome away from there, shouted her mother.But the girl still stood, staring at John. Then she smiled. John smiled back.Her father came up and took her by the hand, pulling her away without looking at John.He recognised the father as well.He had been so nice and friendly in the grotto, while his daughter stood with him for a photo.But without his white beard and red suit, John was invisible again.ldquoSpend it on me, spend on me, whispered his old friend again, as John had flashbacks of Afghanistan.ldquoSpend it on me and I will keep you company, nobody  cares, pleaded his friend.Then the girl was in front of him again, smiling.ldquoThis is for you, Merry Christmas when it comes.Her father stood by her, holding her hand, but still not looking at John.It was chocolate. The same chocolate bar shersquod chosen with glee in the grotto.ldquoThank you, said John and the girl left with her dad.Johnrsquos old friend was now silent.

Not just for glaciers that have lakes in front of them, but also those that donrsquot have lakes leave behind signs of how big they used to be and these landforms are a record of where the glacier was in colder times.ldquoNow you can see glaciers have thinned by up to a  metres.Measuring the changes in the Himalayas, which has many of the worldrsquos highest mountains, was no easy feat because of the sheer scale of the landscape.Mr King added: ldquoBecause the mountains are so steep and big, the weathering rates are really high, so therersquos a lot of rock and avalanche debris that works its way down the glaciers. Once that debris gets thick enough, it can act as a bit of a blanket on the glacier it falls on that can protect the ice underneath, so the front generally doesnrsquot recede as much.The change the team documented is the height change in the glacier rather than the change in .Mr Bolch said: ldquoOur results have important implications for future projections of ice loss from the region because the interaction of glaciers and glacial lakes has not previously been considered in future glacier ice loss estimates."},{"url":null,"title":"online-poll-think-won-stv-leaders-debate","story":"But who do you think won the debate Jackson Carlawclaimed Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn could ldquotake over our country next week, the SNP leader was adamant that Boris Johnson was ldquoutterly unt to be PM and ldquomust be stopped.:STV Leaders Debate as it happened: Parties quizzed on independence and BrexitShe said her party couldplay its part ldquoin denying the Tories the majority they crave at Westminster.But Mr Carlaw claimedthe Tories are not the largest party in the Commons after December , Mr Corbyn could ldquosell out Scotland and cave into Nicola Sturgeonrsquos demand for a second vote on independence in .        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.pushldquoNext week the Union is on the ballot paper, the Tory leader said.ldquoLend the Scottish Conservatives your vote next week and I guarantee this one thing ndash wersquollstop Nicola Sturgeonrsquos isive referendum.Closing statement: Nicola Sturgeon says a vote for the SNP will help build a fairer country we know is possible: https:t.co eeyBVLfgUe #ge #stvdebate pic dySkVlzzdScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said a vote for his party was a vote to stop both Brexit and independence, and ldquoput an end to the constitutional ision we have endured for almost a decade.:SNP candidate who forgot seat name gets boost from tactical voting campaignClosing statement: Jackson Carlaw says the Scottish Tories are the only party for voters who dont want a second independence referendum: https:t.co eeyBVLfgUe #ge #stvdebate pic fUGTNBerTTMeanwhile, addressing the General Election, Labourrsquos Richard Leonard stressed it was only his party or the Tories would could form the next government.ldquoWersquove had a decade of cuts, he argued.Closing statement: Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie urges voters to focus on what matters: https:t.co eeyBVLfgUe #ge #stvdebate pic pyCttspldquoLabour can get to work next week to build an economy that works not just for the few at the top, but which works for the many.Nicola Sturgeon is questioned by Willie Rennie on education standards in Scotlands schools: https:t.co eeyBVLfgUe #ge #stvdebate pic jdDMDDmH"},{"url":null,"title":"cash-reserves-report-reveals-28m-benefit-scotlands-nature-spots","story":"Nature reserves are home to important natural habitats and species and give visitors the chance to experience the best of nature in Scotland.However, a new study has found that as well as these recognisable benefits, their worth to the public goes way beyond this.Scottish Natural Heritagehas measured the value of natural capital across its reserves, with the report - the first of its kind in Scotland - revealing that they are worth an estimated pound million to the public each year.The National Nature Reservescapital is made up of numerous climate, tourism, recreation, and health benefits which are present across the ,ha of land owned and managed by SNH.Francesca Osowska, chief executive of the heritage body, claimed the study shows the many advantages of nature as an asset.She said: ldquoThis innovative report vividly illustrates that our nature reserves are providing an outstandingon investment of time, money and resources.ldquoNature is an asset, but one we need to protect and invest in.

The energy produced is enough to power an estimated , homes, but environmentalists claim biomass energy isn’t as green as it appears.Scotlands biomass sites generate enough energy to power , homes.When people think of clean energy, wind turbines and solar  often come to mind.But biomass power plants – a less well-known method of generating renewable electricity – are booming across the UK and environmental campaigners have raised doubts about their green credentials.The burning of trees or plant matter – known as plant biomass – now accounts for more than a fth of the UK’s renewable energy, second only to wind power.The number of plant biomass power plants in the UK has more than trebled in four years, from  in  to  in .Between them, they now produce enough energy to power around . million homes, analysis by the JPIMedia Data Unit has found.In Scotland, the number has quadrupled from  biomass sites in  to  by . Unlike other forms of green energy, biomass plants produce greenhouse gases. Across the country, the rise in biomass means its total greenhouse gas emissions have nearly reached the amount produced by coal. The industry says wood is sourced from renewable forests, with new trees being planted which store carbon and help to offset the emissions produced.But with the environment proving a key policy battleground in this year’s General Election, campaigners are calling for the practice to come under more scrutiny.Katja Garson, forest and climate campaigner at European campaign group Fern, said: “It is very concerning that in the global push to reduce emissions, more is not being said about the climate impacts of harvesting and burning wood.” Critics have also raised concerns that some power plants ship wood in from overseas, saying this has an added impact on the environment.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Controversial baby names.\"  Baby Names : here are the top  most controversial baby names for girlsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Launching this years festive campaign, the first since the introduction of new drug-driving laws, are, from left, Chief Inspector Darren Faulds, Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, and Superintendent Louise Blakelock, Police Scotlands Deputy Head of Road Policing.\"  Zero tolerance approach to both drink and drug driving this festive season viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The UK now imports . million tonnes of wood pellets a year, more than  times the amount imported a decade ago. Most comes from the USA and Canada, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.Campaigners are also urging the Government to rethink the £. billion in annual subsidies that the biomass industry gets.Almuth Ernsting, of the pressure group Biofuelwatch, said the Government should redirect subsidies to “genuinely low-carbon renewable energy” instead.“For the climate, electricity from forest biomass is no better than electricity from coal,” she said. “Both are completely incompatible with the need to rapidly reduce carbon emissions.”However, Benedict McAleenan, senior advisor to the Renewable Energy Association, said: “Pretending that biomass is somehow no better than coal means ignoring a whole host of facts. “It particularly misunderstands the way forestry works, ignores the important role of regulations and forgets the fact that trees are being regrown all the time.“In reality, UK rules are world-leading and prevent unsustainable practices.”Mr McAleenan said technology being developed called Carbon Capture and Storage would allow biomass plants to “suck carbon out of the atmosphere”, reducing the emissions they produce.He said it would not be possible for the UK to hit net zero-carbon without using bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.Scotland’s carbon reduction ambitions came a step closer with ground-breaking new charter signed by Government and industry last week. A new alliance of industry, academics and Government officially launched Scotland’s programme to deliver the country’s programme of industrial decarbonisation through the deployment of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storagetechnology. The industry led coalition, known as NECCUS, will be instrumental in driving forward the development of CCUS which is recognised as essentialScotland is to meet its target of reducing the country’s carbon emissions to net zero by . CCUS is becoming increasingly commonplace around the world as a way of mitigating climate change. At its simplest, the technology involves capturing the carbon that is emitted from power plantsor energy intensive industries such as chemical and steel producers and then storing the greenhouse gas safely and permanently in rock formations deep below the seabed. Scotland’s project will take this technique further by creating hydrogen which can be used as an alternative to high carbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas for heat and power. CCUS coupled with hydrogen production alongside renewable energy and reforestation – as well as more sustainable production of food and consumer goods – is seen as an essential component of Scotland’s carbon emission reduction target five years before the rest of the UK.The first CCUS plant is expected to be operational by .Mike Smith, NECCUS CEO, said: “We’ve made great progress with wind, solar and other renewable technologies over the last  years. “But the need to decarbonise our economy is urgent so we must build on the good start the UK has made by addressing the hard to decarbonise sectors like heat, heavy industry, transport, and chemicals. “The only way we can achieve that is with the deployment of CCUS. NECCUS, with its unrivalled support from all sectors of industry, academia and Government is now set to deliver on doing just that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : pmAssurances that victims of sexual assault will be given equal treatment, whether they live in urban or rural areas, have been welcomed.

Not surprisingly, the prospect of this was enough to put some people off from coming forward in the first place.“Rape Crisis Orkney and others have rightly been highlighting the need to find ways of allowing examinations to take place. To their credit, successive Justice Ministers have responded positively since I first raised concerns with them over two years ago.#Since then, a lot of work has been carried out by ious organisations and iniduals to finding solutions that work for island communities but respect the need for equal access to services.“I, therefore, welcome the Forensic Medical Services Bill and its commitment to equal access across all health boards, including our islands.  The provision of support from the Taskforce to assist with creating and enhancing facilities to allow this to happen is also reassuring.#While some iniduals may still prefer to access services where, for a iety of reasons, what is key is that this is a matter of choice.“Hopefully, NHS Orkney working with local partners will now be able to build on the progress made to date so that we have a robust and sustainable local self-referral service in line with other parts of the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The project was allowed to sell meat until October , and this extension takes advantage of the European Commission’s approval for Scotland-wide sales until any new potential EU exit date.These licences permit the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland directly to consumers as well as to retailers, such as hotels and butchers.Claudia Rowse, SNH’s head of natural resource management said #We are delighted to announce the continued sale of resident greylag goose meat. Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We know that striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, allowing them to control goose numbers sustainably and sell goose meat for profit.”SNH have said they are working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland. A project review will take place in January , in light of the UK’s EU exit arrangements, and take into account any changes arising from the current review of its General Licences.Sale of wild goose meat shot outside the project is prohibited under the Wildle and Countryside Act .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They showed an improvement in Scotland’s international rating in reading, up on , and now just above the OECD average. However, reading results didn’t reach even  levels, are still far below the  and  figures, and behind those in England.Much more seriously, the scores in both maths and science are dismal. Scotland’s maths score is now at a record low, having dropped in every Pisa survey. Scotland was st overall in maths, below the OECD average, and behind countries like Latvia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic.And, when it comes to science, a skill vital for Scotland’s future economic development, there has been another drop, with scores falling in every Pisa survey since . Scotland now ranks th overall in science, with England th. For a country which supposedly once had the best education system in the world, these are deeply depressing statistics.: Pisa: Performance of Scottish pupils in maths and science at record low: The evidence that shows Scottish education’s critics are playing politics – John SwinneyThis fresh data comes on the back of figures which call into question the SNP Government’s approach towards reducing the attainment gap in secondary schools. New figures show the attainment gap between the most deprived and most affluent students is actually increasing in about  per cent of high schools, despite the provision of ‘pupil equity funding’ targeted at students from disadvantaged background.Among  secondary schools that received attainment funding of at least £,,  reported an improved performance by their most disadvantaged pupils, while  schools showed a decline. So there is precious little evidence that the approach being taken by the Scottish Government is paying idends, despite the funds being invested.Union idendThere is concern amongst the educational establishment about the lack of objective data on the performance of Scottish schools. It was the SNP in government who pulled Scotland out of Timss, a long-running, large-scale international assessment of mathematics and science education, and Pirls, which looks at trends in reading achievement. In addition, the Scottish Survey of Literacy and Numeracy has also been done away with, making it harder to measure what progress is being made.But what we can tell from the data that is published is that, far from seeing improvements across the board, and despite some additional resources being put in, there continue to be serious concerns about the performance of Scottish education. We could once compare ourselves favourably to school results south of the Border, but on most measures we are now trailing behind. And this is despite the fact that spending per head on education in Scotland is much higher than the UK average, thanks to the Union idend of nearly £, per person in Scotland – a Union idend which, of course, the SNP want to see taken away.With a general election just over a week away, it is data such as these which should be at the centre of the political debate. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, asked to be judged on her record on education. And yet, throughout the election campaign, we have seen a relentless focus from her party on just one issue: independence.Nicola Sturgeon has made it clear that every vote for the SNP in the general election is a vote in support of a second independence referendum. That is the one issue that SNP politicians are obsessed with, and it is little wonder that we see the failures in Scottish education exposed in the Pisa data when it is simply not the priority for Government that it should be.Scottish voters next Thursday have the opportunity to use the general election to send a very clear and simple message to the SNP Government: it is time to get back to the day job. Whether it is health, or the performance of the Scottish economy, or what is happening in our schools, Scotland is being let down. For so long as we have a Government that is obsessed with constitutional change, and refusing to tackle the real issues that affect our everyday lives, we are going to have to put up with second best.Murdo Fraser is a Conservative MSP for Mid-Scotland and Fe©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

Nor does it set out plans for overall tax, spending and borrowing, which the other parties do and the SNP’s own manestos did in  and ,” Mr Phillips writes.“It may reflect the fact that such a package of spending increases and tax cuts would mean the UK government having to borrow to cover day-to-day spending – something the other main parties have claimed they would not do.”He continues: “It may also reflect the fact that the SNP’s manesto isn’t really about a plan of action for five years of governing the UK. Rather it is about starting the process of leaving the UK in the next year. It’s about contrasting a near-decade of austerity and years of isive debate over Brexit in the UK, with a positive-sounding vision of independence.”: Does Westminster really have control over staging an independence referendum \u2028‘Rather less progressive’\u2028\u2028The IFS describes other SNP commitments on free TV licences for the over-s, compensation for women born in the s left out of pocket by the increasing state pension age, and no further increases in the state pension age as “costly” and “rather less progressive”, because pensioners are now “less likely to be in poverty than the rest of the population”.And the think tank warns that the SNP’s call to link National Insurance, which is reserved, to devolved rates of income tax would be “reducing revenues by billions of pounds across the UK as a whole”.With the SNP expected to support Jeremy Corbyn’s entry into Number  in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Phillips says the manesto “looks rather a lot like many of Labour’s plans – which is probably more than just a coincidence”.Last year’s report from the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission stated that Scotland’s deficit – £.bn in   when oil revenues are excluded, or  per cent of GDP – would need to come down over the first decade of independence.The IFS says the SNP should be “commended” for accepting the need to shrink the deficit, but Mr Phillips adds: “Pursuing the types of policies suggested in the SNP manesto in an independent Scotland would mean either those cuts would have to be even bigger, or other taxes would have to be increased to pay for the proposed net giveaways.”Public spending will need to grow by less than the rate of economic growth to balance the books, at a time when an ageing population is increasing demands on services, the IFS says.‘Independent Scotland would have to count its pennies’“Even the Conservative’s modest proposals for the coming parliament would see spending grow by around . per cent a year, slightly ahead of forecast economic growth,” Mr Phillips writes. “Therefore, in the short-term at least, independence would likely necessitate more not less austerity.”He concludes: “An independent Scotland would have to count its pennies and pounds in at least its first decade of le. It might therefore be understandable that the SNP manesto does not draw quite the same attention to the price tag of its proposals as Labour and the Liberal Democrats, in particular, do.”Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: “The IFS could not be more clear: independence means more not less austerity.“It means more cuts to the NHS, more cuts to wages, and less money to pay for teaching staff, nurses and police. This is the reality of Nicola Sturgeon’s independence obsession. The Nationalists must now be honest – they would lead Scotland down the road to economic ruin, all for the price of a flag.”Rhoda Grant, Labour’s finance spokesperson, said: “The lack of costings embodies how the SNP have fought this election. They have campaigned on another referendum rather than addressing the real le issues that face people in Scotland every day.“They and this manesto have abjectly failed to come up with serious and credible policies.”Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: “The IFS is unconvinced by the SNP’s spending plans and so am I. “Independence would not be positive for Scotland. It would mean at least a decade of new deep cuts at a time when we need to invest in education and boost mental health services to turn them around.“We’ve got to learn the lessons of Brexit, not pile more chaos on top.”Kirsty Blackman, the SNP’s deputy Westminster leader and economy spokesperson, defended the manesto as “an ambitious and wide-ranging plan to end austerity, invest in our NHS and increase household incomes”.She said: “In the next parliament we could potentially hold the balance of power. While we would never put the Tories into government, we have laid out clearly what our demands would be to any other party expecting our support.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party.

Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#.

We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency.

Fermanagh warden Joe Magee launch the conservation charitys new boat on Lower Lough Erne. The cot named the Joe Magee will be used to transport livestock on and off islands, with the animals grazing resulting in an ideal habitat for breeding wading birds including the endangered curlew. Funding for the cot came from the European Unions INTERREG VA Programme through the RSPB NI-led Co-operation Across Borders for Bioersityproject.Pictures: Ronan McGradeBrad Robson, RSPB NI area manager, who succeeded Joe in Fermanagh in , said: “The cot is used throughout the year. We move about  cattle and  sheep back and forth to our managed islands, as well as livestock to other privately-owned islands. In its first voyages, the new vessel will be used to bring livestock off for the winter.“We were delighted to be able to name it after Joe and it’s vital that we continue our work to provide ideal habitats for the curlews and other waders and wildle species in Lower Lough Erne. We are grateful to the European Union’s INTERREG VA Programme for funding this cot as part of CABB. A further aspect of the CABB project is to raise awareness in the community of the environmental, cultural and historical importance of these wetland habitats.”Joe added: “We originally used a wooden cot, which a farmer let us use. Then we built our own, although at first it had no engine on it and we had to tow it using another boat. So eventually we got an engine and that made le easier!“I knew that across the island of Ireland curlew numbers were dropping, so it’s important that work is still being done to look after them.”Thecot named the Joe Mageewill be used to transport livestock on and off islands, with the animals grazing resulting in an ideal habitat for breeding wading birds including the endangered curlewUnderlining the importance of this part of the project, Gina McIntyre, CEO of the SEUPB, said: “The curlew is one of a number of endangered priority species identied in the environmental protection measures within the EU INTERREG Programme. This new cot is a fantastic example of the tangible impact that EU INTERREG funding is having in safeguarding the natural environment and protecting endangered species, on a cross-border basis. Due to this intervention by the CABB project, curlews will have a much better future. I also want to commend Joe for his commitment to conservation.”The -metre custom-made cot weighs  tonnes and was built by Wales-based marine engineers and workboat builders Mainstay Marine Solutions.These are the worst areas in the UK for drink and drug driving offences Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\" project\" title\"RSPB NIs Brad Robson and former RSPB Fermanagh warden Joe Magee launch the conservation charitys new boat on Lower Lough Erne.

The event, which also included a family and community fun day, marked the end of a year long refurbishment programme.The work commenced in October, last year when the main contractor Martin Hamilton, a Ballymena based company, arrived on site.Over the course of the next twelve months they completely transformed the inside of the church building as well as adding a new welcome hub.Over the past ten years the congregation has been thinking how best to provide st century facilities for a twenty first century church. Under the guidance of the design team of Kennedy Fitzgerald Architects, Williams  Shaw and Doran Consulting we have been able to take the project forward.The now current minister, Rev William Sinclair was called in September  and ministers along with associate minister Rev Matthew Boyd.First Ballymena Presbyterian Church was one of the first congregations to have an organ installed in the meeting house, and a new digital organ was installed during the current building project. Moving on from here, First Ballymena is a congregation that seeks to have a passion for Jesus Christ and a compassion for people. They want to engage with the community and be a compassionate church with a heart at the heart of the town of Ballymena. The new welcome hub helps open up the church and makes it an inviting place to be.Over the course of the past year, Matthew Boyd has joined William Sinclair in the ministry team and his main role is to strengthen the church’s mission in the community and to develop discipleship programmes in the congregation.Matthew Boyd stated his primary focus is on Discipleship and it has been encouraging to see just how God has been working in a number of people’s lives.Also as a church they have been going “over the wall” and engaging with people outside of the congregation who don’t yet know Jesus. It is the prayer of the church that God might continue to use them to reach out and point others to Jesus.

To be truthful I was in a very dark place. Irsquom not saying I was suicidal but probably close to it. ldquoI was . It was a strange thing. All I wanted to do was stay in the house and lock the door, but still the craving was there for company. Irsquod stand at the window hoping that the people walking past were coming for me.A collection was made of blankets and shoeboxes for SerbialdquoTherersquos a story going around about a person who was so lonely that he would post himself a letter just so the postman would come to the door to deliver it. That is very profound when you get to that stage. I wasnrsquot as bad as that but not far off it.Through Chest, Heart and Stroke, Robert found out about the Age NI club at North Road which ultimately led to his salvation: ldquoI turned up and what I saw actually amazed me ndash  elderly gentlemen discussing everything you can think of from finance to government to football to the shipyards.ldquoThis is exactly what I needed in my le at that time.ldquoThey were all strangers, and quickly became friends. Most of them have passed on unfortunately but we do have the present days menrsquos club. We still have  members and they are all fairly active and they are all great friends.Some of the participants at Age NI enjoying a game of bingoRobert said: ldquoYou have to take the step, but there is help thereyou do.ldquoAge NI do provide excellent help. Therersquos no doubt about it they go out of their way to encourage you to attend and to interact with other service users. And of course you have a meal here every day and a bit of chat.ldquoIrsquom here every day. Irsquom a service user two days a week a volunteer the other three days. Itrsquos such a wonderful service that I want to give something back.Robert, who used to work in the meat industry, commented: ldquoWork is important because it gives you a sense of purpose. Age NI gives you that same sense of purpose, a sense of being.You know there are people there willing to help you out.Discussing loneliness he said: ldquoThe loneliness factor is a strange one, you could be at a football match in a crowd of , and still be lonely.ldquoLe is so fast with the younger generation itrsquos hard to blame them for not checking on elderly neighbours.

I married my husband in . He was a cook during the war . We lived in Cyprus for three years and had two children ndash a girl and a boy, Michael and Anthea.ldquoMy dad was in a home and my mum wasnrsquot great by herself as she got older. I had orced and a got a flat in Clarawoodto be near my mum and dad. Now theyrsquore both gone.ldquoAll my aunts and everyone are gone except one cousin who comes to see me every Sunday and takes me shopping. My ex-husband is dead and my children, who live in Peterborough, come to see me every summer.ldquoWhen I broke my leg and was in hospital for six weeks I had to find somewhere  to live that was better suited to my mobility.Mabel, who now lives in secure accommodation for older people in east Belfast, said: ldquoHalf of the place is residents who canrsquot get out at all.ldquoIrsquom able to get out with my trolleyI order a taxi. Once a week I get picked up in the minibus and taken here. Irsquom the first on the bus.ldquoI really look forward to it, everybody is so good and nice. The people here feel like family. ldquoThe rest of the week gets very lonely. I watch TV but itrsquos not the same as talking with real people.ldquoItrsquos important to encourage people to take that first step out of the house, therersquos always help at the end of it.Wendy is head of a very happy familyAge NIrsquos day centre at the Skainos Centre is run by Wendy McKillion who is in the strange position of being lsquohead of the familyrsquo despite being younger than all of the people she cares for. The -year-old said: ldquoIt all starts when I have a referral from social services. I leave the centre to pay a home visit to assess the older people who really need to get out of the house, the people who are really isolated.ldquoIt is nice being in the position to offer somebody a social day at the centre ndash their lestyle improves as soon as they set foot through the door.ldquoTheyrsquore having a three-course home-cooked meal from our cook that we have on site. Jeanrsquos been with us for  years.ldquoBasically here at the centre the staff provide a good social day for service users. If theyrsquore having a good day wersquore having a good day.ldquoI have an open door policy that anyone at any time can come and have a private chat with me. They all have my mobile, they can get me any time and believe you me they do.ldquoItrsquos good security for them. If someone hasnrsquot turned up Irsquoll try to ring them or ring their next of kin, then go round and check on them.ldquoThey feel like my family. Some people only come in one day, some come in two, some come in three. It depends on inidual needs.ldquoIrsquove been looking after older people from I was in my twenties. It doesnrsquot get any easier when they pass away.Wendy, whose twin sister Gilly also works for Age NI, is full time with the organisation while many others lend their support on a voluntary basis:ldquoThe volunteers are worth their weight in gold. They could be semi-retired, they could be students, they could be people like Robert . All the time they give is appreciated.Recently Age NI teamed up with Blythswood Care to put together a relief package containing  blankets and  shoeboxes to be sent to Serbia.The group has had its share of celebrity mums with both Van Morrison and Dan Gordonrsquos mother attending.Proof that you donrsquot have to be alone to suffer from lonelinessLucy Quinn is proof that it is still possible to be lonely even when you come from a very large family.The east Belfast woman has eight children,  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.She said: ldquoI see my family very regularly but therersquos some days Irsquom just sitting in the house on my own. I bought myself a recliner chair and Irsquove got aframe to help me when I need to get up.ldquoIrsquod read magazines and do crosswords books to put the time in. I buy them to keep my brain active. Irsquod watch some TV as well.She said: ldquoI originally came from down by the shipyards. My father worked there and my brothers-in-law.ldquoMy husband died  years ago. He died aged  and one of my sons also died aged .ldquoItrsquos heartbreaking when you lose people who are very close to you.She commented: ldquoIt seems strange to say I get lonely when Irsquove got such a big family but loneliness isnrsquot straightforward.Lucy, who lives with her youngest daughter Karen, said: ldquoOne night Irsquoll have sevenin, sometimes there can be  or  of them in. You never know until they press the buzzer who will be coming.ldquoI have  grandchildren and great grandchildren. I think itrsquos  grandchildren and  great grandchildren.ldquoI give them all money for birthdays and Christmas. Therersquos too many to keep track of all their interests.ldquoThatrsquos how Irsquod spend most of my money. I save up. I donrsquot smoke and I donrsquot drink and I hardly ever go out.Lucy has been coming to Age NI for  years next May: ldquoThey used to be up in the North Road, I started off there.ldquoA girl called Valerie who used to the run the club, she said to myself and a couple of neighbours to come along. That was the start of it.ldquoIrsquom disabled, but not as much then as I am now.ldquoI love coming here. I come one day a week. When my daughters are all working it gives me something to look forward to.ldquoI love everything here, it would be the only exercise I get. ldquoThe cook is brilliant, Jean has been here since day one. ldquoThe craic is brilliant, I might be disabled but I can still carry on a joke.Older people in numbers in  older people are lonely in NIK older people in NI say that TV is their main form of companyAge NI has a total of  day centres across Northern Ireland.million people in the UK can go five or six days without seeing or speaking to anyoneThere are , people over the age of  living in Northern IrelandHow to help lonely peopleAge NI are at the forefront of change, enabling older people to have a voice and to remain independent, supporting those who need help in society and inspiring people to love later le.

Set in an old theatre in the s, the former St Genevieve’s pupil’s take on the festive and timeless classic will take families of all ages through a journey as they watch all the characters come together to show Ebenezer Scrooge the error of his ways.“The MAC’s Christmas audience is quite young so to introduce three ghosts can become quite scary so you have to work with that,” she said. “They always say write what you know and I know the theatre. I’ve set the story in a theatre where Scrooge is a producer, along with Jacob Marley they were the big theatre producers of the day. There is a term in threatre called the ‘ghost light’ this would have been turned on through the night so that people, who were still working through, wouldn’t have fallen through the trapdoor. I loved that idea and thought this would work as a way to introduce our ghosts. “This theatre, which Scrooge is in charge of, isn’t making the profit it used to the ghosts come to le in the hope that Scrooge won’t close down the theatre. The kids who will be in the audience are helping us create this story and it’s a way to introduce such a classic to a younger audience,” she said.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":null,"title":"dissidents santa with rifle image condemned by the psni","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The SDLP were out in force on the ground in the Lower Ormeau and the Markets this week.SDLP’s Claire HannaAs her partys most high-profile MLA on broadcast media, and with personal and family links to the constituency dating back decades, Hanna has a strong hand generally.She is also fortunate in her main unionist opponent. In neighbouring East Belfast, DUP MP Gavin Robinson has kept a relatively low-profile. He hasnt antagonised those who didnt vote for him.The same cannot be said of Little-Pengelly in South Belfast. When she was elected, she had the opportunity to build bridges with nationalists and others in this most erse constituency - as an act of self-preservationnothing .DUP’s Emma Little-PengellyInstead, she became involved in rows over bonfires and UVF flags. It was unwise to antagonise those who otherwise might have developed a civil relationship with a reconciliatory and progressive DUP MP.Yet Little-Pengelly certainly cant be written off in next months poll. She has a fine electoral track record in this constituency. She increased her partys vote by an impressive % between  and , something for which she is given insufficient credit.She is a prodigious constituency worker. Despite Ulster Unionist Michael Henderson standing, she should secure a massive unionist vote.DUP Balmoral councillor David Graham is running her campaign, and doesnt think it is a lost cause.\"Emma got over , votes last time, and there is room for growth in our core area,\" he says.\"If you compare our  bestboxes in the constituency with the top  nationalist boxes in  - when we did exceptionally well - there was still a far higher proportion of people in our best areas who didnt vote or werent even registered.\"Weve done a lot of work on the ground to change that, and unionist voters are very motivated for this election. Emma grew unionist turnout in , and we need to do that again. I think we will as people realise it has never been more important to defend the Union.\"Graham also cites the outgoing MPs grassroots endeavours: \"Emma has dealt with over , cases in her office in her two years as an MP. Christopher Stalford is a hard-working MLA and we have an excellent council team locally. That helps us hugely.\"Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw The key to the DUPs chances is how Alliance fares. If the Remain camp is fairly evenly split and Hanna doesnt pull signicantly ahead of Bradshaw, then Little-Pengelly should win.Support for Bradshaw next month is dficult to predict. The SDLP was , votes ahead of Alliance in . Yet the Naomi factor and the partys extraordinary success in the EU election may have changed the dynamic.Alliance surged ahead of the SDLP in Mays council poll. But the fact Bradshaw stood as an Ulster Unionist Conservative candidate in  might limit her reach more than it would an Alliance candidate without such a history.Ray Kennedy was the SDLPs election guru in South Belfast for two decades. He ran Alasdair McDonnells campaigns. He says: \"This seat is now Claire Hannas to lose. But I think it will be tight at the top with the SDLP just edging it over the DUP, and Alliance coming a good third.\"Alasdair won around , soft unionist votes in . I reckon theyre in doubt, with these voters perhaps switching to Alliance or staying at home.\"The SDLPs perceived pact with Sinn Fein doesnt help as its being sold by others as a sectarian pact.\"However, Kennedy sees Hanna winning support where. \"Claire wont get % of the Green vote, but she will get a fair chunk. But I think she will secure no more than half Sinn Fein votes, and perhaps only a third,\" he says.\"The benchmark will be whether she manages to get as high a turnout as Alasdair in and the SDLP won over , votes.\"While forecasting defeat for Alliance this time, Kennedy predicts future growth.\"Alliance did very well in the council election, but the archaic and undemocratic first-past-the-post system for Westminster doesnt suit the party,\" he says.\"I see it occupying the same space in South Belfast as we did  years ago. Alasdair ran for Westminster and wasnt close, but he made up ground in every election and we used that momentum to grow our vote. Alliance will do similarly. It has bright prospects ahead.\""},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile ian paisley certain to weather the storm in north antrims staunch dup country","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In response, we immediately suspended human review of Siri audio requests, reviewed our practices and policies and released improvements to Siri’s privacy protections,” he said.These include no longer retaining audio recordings of Siri interactions by default and a facility to delete Siri history.Google’s public policy manager Ryan Meade said that the company does not and did not retain audio recordings from Google Assistant by default.“We do not store users’ data unless they choose to opt in. Opting in helps the Assistant better recognise a users’ voice over time, and also helps improve the Assistant for everyone by allowing us to use audio to understand more languages and accents,” he said.“We are automatically deleting more audio data.

When her family suggested the alternative gt idea Margaret was delighted, saying: “That’s a great idea. Sure I don’t need anything!”Margaret’s daughter Irene said: “Friends and family were very generous and we had a lovely get together in the home for mum. “Of course she got other little things as well, but mum really appreciated the donations towards RNIB.“She’s had a lot of support from RNIB’s local Community Access Worker Jackie Cotton, and Mark Waterman from sensory support over the years, making sure she has anything to make le that bit easier and more enjoyable. “She’s been stocked with Talking Books and newspapers, has a talking watch and clock and lots of other things they’ve suggested.“She also really enjoyed attending the local Insight visually impaired group, facilitated by Jackie, for many years. “I would have accompanied her on trips and dinners. She loved them. “With her more limited mobility now she loves her talking books, particularly biographies in these later years, and listening to gospel music and speakers.”Jackie Cotton, RNIB’s Community Access Worker for the Mid Ulster Area said: We’re so grateful to Margaret, Irene and their family and friends for supporting the Mid Ulster Community Talking Book Challenge.“In the past year we’ve seen a % increase in RNIB Talking Books subscribers so we know this service is in demand from people in the local community.“Their donations will help us create even more books for people of all ages to enjoy for years to come.“RNIB is committed to making every day better for blind and partially sighted people across Northern Ireland, but we simply cant do it alone. “Right now, we can only support one in three people affected by sight loss, but together, we can smash the barriers that stop people with sight loss thriving.”If you’d like to join the community effort to sponsor RNIB Talking Books, don’t hesitate to contact RNIB NI’s Area Fundraising Manager Hazel Stirling onhazel.stirling@rnib.org.ukor  .

The main political parties’ repeated failure to stand up for nurses is responsible fo the unacceptable conditions in which they have to work, and responsible, therefore, for the ‘unprecedented’ industrial action.“We need to stem the steady drip of skilled nurses emigrating, because, along with inequality in pay, the shortage of nurses here results in an unacceptable, sometimes unsustainable workload. “Recently, the paediatric ward in Derry lost one of the best young nurses I have ever had the pleasure of working with, leaving her family and friends in the mouth of Christmas for better working conditions and a decent wage in Australia. “We must act before the steady drip becomes a tide.  Aontuacute is committed to supporting all healthcare workers. They are there for us when we need them we are there for them when they need us.”Dr McNicholl says he also wants a New Ireland which will “unite Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter”, offering economic and social justice and providing housing, health and social care for those most in need.Aontuacute is opposed to the cyanide gold mining in the Sperrins and Seaacuten is particularly concerned about the risk to the health of the local people, the destruction of the natural habitat of our native animals and the ravaging of the beauty of the landscape.The current uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the likely reality of Brexit are a great source of concern for Ireland North and South, but Seaacuten moves forward with Aontuacute towards the creation of a borderless and free New Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The care and services that Foyle Hospice delivers have impacted thousands of lives. Of course, Foyle Hospice requires a huge level of support from the community to deliver those services and employ  staff.A volunteer team of over  people also supports the hospice in everything from gardening to counselling.Foyle Hospice costs approximately pound. million a year to run and just % of its total running costs come from the Health and Social Care Board.Foyle Hospice has five shops in Waterloo Place, Springtown, Limavady, Strabane and Castlederg. The shops were revamped over two years ago as Loved and Cherished and are a big part of the fundraising accounting for almost pound, in net income.The profile of the shops is helped by an annual Ladies Lunch and Vintage Fashion Fair, which has featured guests such as Phil Coulter, Miriam O’Callaghan, James Nesbitt and Nadine Coyle, Jackie McMonagle, the shops area manager says.“It showcases all the shops’ clothes and provides a great  for the shops. It’s a hugely successful event.“When I joined nine years ago we only had three shops and now we have five. The outlet in Springtown Industrial estate is phenomenal - it is non-stop. We opened that five years ago. That is the hub where everything comes for sorting and distribution to the other shops but we decided to open it up to the public.”Christmas fundraisingChristmas is a busy time for the hospice fundraising team with annual events such as Lights of Love where people can sponsor lights on a large Christmas tree at the hospice which is provided by Derry City and Strabane District Council.Hampers are also a big part of the hospice’s fundraising at this time of year. Pauline McGuinness, a volunteer, helps prepare  Christmas hampers to go out to shops and businesses across the north-west for a draw with each one raising about pound.“This is an old-fashioned fundraiser,” community fundraising officer Ailbhe Temple says.“It’s a big fundraiser for us. We go out at Christmas and Easter with  hampers and do a few Halloween ones as well.”Coin HuntHundreds of collection boxes are part of the hospice’s fundraising activity. The Coin Hunt boxes are emptied at the Fundraising Centre and counted five days a week. A total of over pound, in coins was counted last year.A reduction in loose change due to the increase in card transactions has seen a drop in the income from the coin boxes, Damien Brown who counts the coins says.“It used to be over pound,. We are aware that more and more people are going cashless and are looking at ways how we might best address that to ensure continued support,” he said.Unique serviceThe importance of fundraising to the hospice is that it allows it to provide the unique service it does, Ailbhe Temple, Community Fundraising Officersays, not just in terms of specialised medical care but the time and attention patients get.“We have time here. Our nurses have time to speak to patients, time to spend with patients and time to spend with family members. That is an important part of what we do, especially at end of le when you are not going to get it back again. Our focus is the patient and that the patients needs are met.”Those needs have included the hosting of a number of weddings for patients and providing whatever home comforts they desire.“It’s about making people comfortable at that time because it is such a dficult time. It’s a nice place and everyone can get involved in the care. It’s not just medical, medical, medical.”The funding comes from weekly draws, the shops, coin hunt, male and female walks and fundraising events like the London Marathon, the Great North Run and other local events and donations.FundraisingFundraising is getting more dficult in terms of events, Ailbhe says.“I think it goes back to the fact that so much goes on in the city. It is a struggle to raise money and we are always trying to think of something dferent but not too dferent because you want people to get involved.“But the people of Derry and Strabane and the surrounding areas are amazing. “We get over poundm a year andwe didn’t have that support, we would not be here and would not be able to support the , patients we have supported in the last  years.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So, what is the connection between Hippocrates the father of medicine, an ancient oriental tree, a Greek born medical consultant and the section of Derry’s Walls that the terraced houses of Nailors’ Row once nestled under  Every week, hundreds, maybe thousands of us, walk through historic Bishop’s Gate to and from the city centre. But how many of us pay more than a cursory glance to the beautul patch of sculpted greenery that lies on the right-hand side of the road just outside the walled city  googletag.cmd.push In your mind you may have fleetingly admired its prettiness and thought it a vast improvement on the strip of plain grass that used be there. Just around the corner from the end of the garden, it gives way to steep green slopes that roll downwards the Bogside. It is a site that has seen its fair share of trouble over the decades standing as it does right on the boundary between the Fountain and the Bogside. The at times, serious sectarian clashes there have seen it labelled with one of those cold and condemnatory Northern Ireland terms – interface. However, since November  that small piece of land right in the middle of the often wrongly maligned trouble spot has stood as a quiet beacon to something that should truly uny us all – the gt of good health. googletag.cmd.push It is known as the New Le Garden and is a place of reflection for those who have been given a second crack at existence through organ donation. Whilst the garden is dedicated to all those who have both received and given all transplantable organs either as living donors or through donation after death, a local group based at the city’s hospital has championed the garden and the spirit in which it was created. The words on a stone monument in the heart of the garden erected by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group state: “This Garden of Le celebrates the gt of new le through organ donation and gives thanks to all organ donors, both living and deceased, for their tremendous generosity and empathy in providing new le through their selfless sacrice.” When the garden was opened six years ago, the official ceremony was attended by representatives of all the city’s main churches, the Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, the Fountain and Bogside communities, residents of nearby Alexander House and many people from the then Derry City Council who backed the project. The commemorative garden was also integrated with St Columba’s Peace Garden which occupies the same space. On a chosen Sunday each Christmas time since , as people with arms weighed down with shopping bags in preparation for the festive period hurry by, a group of people gather at the garden to do what it says on the monument – give thanks and remember. The annual ceremony isn’t one that pays attention to either pomp or circumstance. Instead, it’s conducted quietly and reverently, consisting mainly of a few meaningful, heartfelt words by someone who has faced the crushing ordeal of facing leaving le before the inexpressible and joyous relief of having it prolonged by those who have been kind and brave enough to donate. Prayers and a few well-chosen hymns and songs only add to the poignancy of the occasion. With each passing year some of the faces are no longer there, but their families are. New faces are also there – new because they have been added to the list awaiting a new kidney, a new heart, liver or lung. Those who already have done or are waiting to provide a new lease of le are also there, as are the families of those who by their passing handed on extended le to many others. The garden is also where those awaiting a transplant can visit and gain strength. What however, has that got to do with Hippocrates, an ancient oriental tree and specialist medic from modern Greece  The Plane Tree of Kos, or the Tree of Hippocrates according to legend, is the place where in ancient Greece the father of medicine taught his students. The current -foot high tree in the centre of Kos is only around  years old but is believed to be a descendant of the original tree which stood there over two and a half thousand years ago. Seeds or cuttings from the tree have been transported all over the world and one will soon be planted at the New Le Garden in Derry. It will not be the first time a cutting of the famed tree has been placed in Northern Ireland. The practice was first initiated by an intriguing doctor who landed on these shores in the s and who sadly passed away in . Dr Dimitrios Oreopoulous was born in Alexandroupolis and was one of five brothers who grew up in impoverished circumstances. However, he managed to get admitted to the medical school at the University of Athens and received his specialist certicate in . He then moved to the City Hospital in Belfast as a renal registrar where he completed his PhD in nephrology. Upon completion of his studies in Belfast Dr Oreopoulous was recruited by the Toronto Western Hospital where he continued his research at the Metabolic Renal Unit. It was in  whilst studying at Queen’s that the Greek medic presented seeds from the Plane Tree of Kos to both the university and Erskine House at the City Hospital where it continues to thrive to this day. In fact, in , the Erskine House Tree was nominated and won the Woodland Trust’s Tree of the Year competition. In turn, Dr James Douglas, former consultant Nephrologist at Belfast City Hospital, took several cuttings from the Erskine House Tree and these have now matured into saplings ready to be transferred to the New Le Gardens across Northern Ireland. Outside of Derry, other gardens can be found at Kiltonga in Newtonards and at Botanic Gardens in Belfast next door to Queen’s University. Patron of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients, Eamonn Holmes said of the tree at Belfast City Hospital being named tree of the year: “The Erskine House Tree means many things to many dferent people throughout the world, especially the transplant family. I am delighted that the tree has received prestigious accolade and will forever remain a symbol of the ‘Gt of Le’ and a representation of our brave organ donors.” According to the Department of Health, around  people are waiting for an organ transplant, and sadly, around  people die each year while on the waiting list. If you want to add your name to the NHS Organ Donor Register you can either register online at the Organ Donation NI website at https:www.organdonationni.info  or telephone    . A lesser known option is the possibility of becoming a living donor and the most common type in this respect is kidney donation. This takes place when one kidney is removed from a healthy person and transplanted into someone , often a relative. Quite rightly, the NHS point out that this is a major decision to make and everyone who comes forward undergoes a thorough assessment. All live donors and recipients are reviewed by an independent assessor who makes sure there is no pressure or coercion involved and that all parties understand the risks of complications. To make the distinction, the Organ Donor Register is only for those who wish to donate after death – to become a living donor, you must contact a transplant centre directly. The Living Donation Kidney Transplant Team can be contacted at Belfast City Hospital also on    . The team have also released a strategy paper on live kidney donation which can be viewed at https:www.odt.nhs.uk odt-structures-and-standards key-strategies living-donor-transplantation-strategy- . The annual service of remembrance organised by the Altnagelvin Renal Support Group, including the planting of the Plane tree sapling, takes place this year on Sunday, December  at the New Le Garden, Nailors Row at pm.

Last week, with victory over St Killians Garron Tower, they annexed the Liatroim Fontenoys Cup for the first-time in the schools history. St Colms lost to four time winners St Pius Magherafelt in the  final but this time, they went one better. Despite inclement weather at Bellaghys Drumanee training complex, St Colms dug deep to see off a fancied St Killians side in the closing stages. googletag.cmd.push Just two points separated them at the break and the teams were level as the clock ticked towards full-time but late points from Sineacutead McGuigan and Aoe Doyle edged St Colms over the line. It was a victory built on a solid defensive footing. St Killians bagged four first-half goals in their semi-final replay win over Loreto but Clodagh McPeake and Niamh Grahamwere kept under wraps. St Colms had a five week lay-off since their last competitive game, due to  of coach Fiona Devlins squad being involved in the schools musical production of Oliver. googletag.cmd.push “The girls remained focused but could have been frustrated but I didnt allow this mentality to set in as we knew the final was in the very near future. It was a matter of keeping the head down and working hard on the training field,” Devlin outlined. “With the assistance of Ballinascreen club, we played a mix of St Colms seniors and other girls from the club of a similar age the Sunday before the final. “This collective meeting was absolutely essential, from a mental perspective, to get the team focused and be ready for the match situation.” In the end, their battling qualities came to the fore to force them over the finish line with captain Aoe Doyle thwarting McPeake in the closing stages when a St Killians goal would have turned the tables. In the final analysis Doyle proved the dference and St Colms move forward into the All-Ireland series in the new year, armed with the experiences gained from last seasons run. Doyle, was marshalled well by Orla Donnelly when she began the game at full-forward, before a reshuffle changed the shape of the St Colms team. Ciara Scullion, with illness, was a doubt going into the game and only lasted to half-time. Doyle went to midfield, and with Erin Kelly putting a tremendous sht on Scullions opponent, it left Doyle free to impose herself on St Killians. THREE NIL Conditions were dficult and heavy underfoot following some heavy showers just before throw-in, but both teams worked hard from start to finish and most of the scores at both ends came from placed balls. Draperstown got off to a quick start with three Sineacutead McGuigan frees within the opening six minutes and with St Killians getting four first-half goals in their semi-final replay, this was a positive start from St Colms. Niamh Graham, who bagged - in their win over Loreto, pointed three frees to level the game after  minutes. St Killians then hit Draperstown for a goal. A long ball into the danger area wasnt cleared and Clodagh McPeake finished to the net. St Colms reply was instant and almost a carbon copy. An Aoe Doyle free caused panic in the St Killians defence and Mary Jo McEldowney was on hand to nab a goal and level the game once again. The Tower controlled much of the half and will rue not being further in the lead, despite Graham and Sine Woodhouse giving them a slender lead. Half-time:St Killians -St Colms - “Excellent pressure from our defence resulted in possible scores for St Killians going wide.” Devlin admitted. “So essentially we were going into the second-half believing that this final was in our grasp, one score would make the dference and with dogged determination those girls delivered inside three minutes of the second-half with a magnicent goal.” A free from Doyle was finished to the net by Grace Kelly and St Colms were back in front. Seconds later, St Killians had a chance to regain their lead but Niamh Graham saw her penalty saved by Rhiannah O’Neill. For the rest of the game, as the weather and conditions worsened, the game transformed into a battle and both teams were well matched. With eight minutes remaining, Niamh Graham brought the sides leveland a draw wasnt out of the question but Aoe Doyle had other ideas. She gathered a loose sliotar before slotting over St Colms first and only point from play, putting them back in front. She then won a free, allowing Sineacutead McGuigan to pop over the insurance point but St Killians werent finished yet. They mounted one last attack but when Clodagh McPeake attempted to conjure a winning goal it was Doyle who tracked back to cut out the danger. It ended St Killians comeback hopes and ensured another piece of silverware was on its way back to St Colms. Fiona Devlin hailed the work-rate and the intensity her side operated at, evening in those crucial closing stages. It epitomised their spirit. “When St Killians went on that final attack in injury time, the girls were exhausted with the heavy under foot conditions but they dug deep and you could see leaders all over the pitch taking responsibility, to ensure no goal was conceded,” she explains. “Aoe Doyle was back helping out her defence in true style at the finish. The heroic save young Rhiannah ONeill made, in nets, followed by her full-back line putting their bodies on the line and got ball the out to Aoe - epitomised the determination and resolve of all the girls.” The win puts them on the All-Ireland trail in February, something Devlin feels is bonus territory for her side. However, it is something they will relish and the experience quite a number of the squad have from last year will be an advantage. “Moving up a grade this year never phased them, they looked forward to each game and as the competition progressed they believed they were in with a chance of lting the Liatroim Fontenoys Cup for the first time in the schools history,” Devlin stressed. “Even though this journey so far has been remarkable for these girls at St Colms High school, it must be remembered they all hail from the Ballinascreen camogie club and together with their families,  and the wider community - they have all played a massive part in achieving this Ulster title.” MATCH STATS: St Colm’s: Rhiannah O’Neill, Leanne McCullagh, Shannon Scullion, Niamh Hamill, Rachel McCullagh, Cliodhna Hickson, Ciara Scullion, Erin Kelly, Cara Donnelly, Anna McDaid, Sineacutead McGuigan , Mary Jo McEldowney , Shannon Burns, Aoe Doyle , Grace Kelly .

Sub: Cara O’Boyle for A Donnelly . Ref: Sean McGuigan . PLAYER OF THE MATCH Aoe Doyle - There were outstanding performances from Shannon Scullion, Cliodhna Hickson, Erin Kelly and Sineacutead McGuigan. However, Aoe Doyle was the stand out player. She won frees inside in the early stages which were crucial. Her second-half performance was immense. From setting Grace Kelly up for the goal to finding the legs to retreat and help her defence, especially in injury time. TURNING POINT Second-half start – St Colms trailed by two at the break and need a hell of a start to the second-half. Grace Kellys goal was vital, in that it lted St Colms but when St Killians were awarded a penalty in the next attack, they needed a vital save on the line from Rhiannah O’Neill, before Cliodhna Hicksons clearance. A massive moment. SCORE OF THE GAME Kelly goal – Three minutes into the second-half, Aoe Doyle was fouled at midfield but she didnt stand on ceremony. Instinctively, she delivered a perfect ball to Grace who caught it, turned and she had only one thing on her mind – goal. It was an almighty score from such a young player.

Laura Kelly took part in a special session with Lisa Lavery, who has twenty years’ experience in the industry, through the ScreenWorks programme which offers specialist training sessions. Like all ScreenWorks sessions, the Costume Design programme gave students a real insight into what it’s like to work in the industry. The young people taking part visited the Ulster Museum to see real period costumes andwas able to create a mask to their own design. The aim was to allow the young people to explore their creativity and gain a good understanding of the job. googletag.cmd.push “The industry has changed massively from when I started, said Lisa. There was so little work then but there’s been an explosion of opportunity here in Northern Ireland and it’s so important that we share our skills with young people. It took me a long time to learn the nuances of the job and I think it’s essential to share what I learned with people like Laura,” she said. Since the programme started in ,  young people have benefitted from the teaching and guidance of highly successful industry professionals. In , there are  more sessions available in a range of topics such as production accountancy, location scouting, catering, hair and make-up and animation. googletag.cmd.push The aim is to help students explore career options, develop skills that will help them in their careers and courses and to continue to build a highly skilled talent pool to benefit the industry. Sean Boyle from Into Film explained that the courses are a great opportunity for young people to learn tips and techniques from professionals in the industry. He said: “There are so many dferent jobs available in these industries but often young people and their teachers and parents aren’t aware of the opportunities available right here in Northern Ireland.” There are several ScreenWorks sessions coming up in Derry.

The likes of Martin Roddy, Andy Russell, Paul Deery and Tony Fleming, to mention a few. These guys taught me a lot as I came up through the ranks and I will be forever thankful to them.‘The Fire Service is one big family and everyone had each other’s back. I worked with a great bunch of lads at both fire stations and had many happy years in Red Watch.’Jim said he hoped to take a few months off and relax and take in a few foreign holidays, adding he would miss the Service and intends to keep in touch with his former colleagues.“I will miss the boys, of course, and it will take a bit of getting used to.”Reminiscing on some of the more “hairy” shouts he took part in over the years, he continued: “I remember the serious trouble that kicked off in the city over the Drumcree situation a few years ago. We were in the middle trying to put a fire out with petrol and blast bombs coming from one side and plastic bullets from the other.“A notable event was three rescues in a -minute period late one night. We pulled people from a building in Nicholson Square, minutes later more at Duncreggan Road before rushing to Shantallow’s Ardnamoyle Park for another. I think it was  people in the three shouts. Never known it to happen before and hope it never happens again. And on a lighter side, he recalled working on night sht and getting a call to a car fire in Foyle Street car park.Jim recalled: “We got out of the appliance and the car was well alight. I was putting water onto the fire and I said to my mate that car looks like mine. I went around to the front and checked the number plate - it was mine! “Margaret, my we, had been up at St Columb’s Hall at choir practice. No sympathy from the boys either. When we went back to the station they were trying to sell me hot cars and asbestos seat covers.”The popular firefighter was well supported at Thursday night’s presentation with over  firefighters in attendance at the Bishop’s Gate Hotel with many speeches praising Jim and wishing him a long and happy retirement.And what does the future hold for Jim  He said: “After a few holidays I hope to carry out some voluntary work with local dementia groups. My late mother suffered from the disease and it would be nice to give something back in her memory.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The property also benefits from an integral garage.A key feature of the island is the direct road access to the mainland via Castle Island Road and onto Strangford Road which connects Strangford with Downpatrick.The new owners will share the island with Quoile Yacht Club, which offers some of the finest facilities in Strangford Lough, and the Quoile Pondage Nature Reserve and Bird Hide.The enclosed garden and grounds at the house extend to . acres and slope from the house to Castle Island Road and include manicured lawns and mature trees which provide shelter and amenity. There is also a small gravel area next to the house with trees and shrubs.An extensive block of farmland lies within a perimeter fence and is well suited for the grazing of livestock and production of silage hay.Estate agents Osborne King say that while nestled in private surroundings, the island conveniently lies a short distance from several towns including Downpatrick.While there is an abundance of amenities on the island including wildle, and sporting opportunities, there are also plenty of interest points nearby, including Castle Ward and Delamont Country Park.Gavin Clarke, from Osborne King, says the property has been on the market for over a week and is already generating interest from potential buyers.ldquoThis delightful property would make an ideal second home or, alternatively, a main family residence, given its tranquil location and magnicent views, with the Mournes to one side and Strangford on the other, he said.ldquoThe current owners have lived there for around  years and while they are very sorry to see it go, they look forward to seeing others benefit from it. The bungalow is ready to walk into as it has been well maintained down through the years.Gavin added: ldquoWith a couple of viewings in the pipeline, it would be nice to sell this side of Christmas.Further information is available from the Osborne King office, Donegal Square South, Belfast on    or email property@osborneking..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Businesswoman.jpg","title":"Businesswomen mentor Assumption students  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH students have taken part in their first management programme that promotes womenrsquos capacity for leadership.Over  sixth form girls at Assumption Grammar School spent the day recently shadowing female leaders in a range of industries including financial services, recruitment, law, media, construction and health, last month.SistersIN Female Leadership Programme, was launched this year to help foster girlsrsquo confidence in leadership roles.Organisers say it gave those taking part an opportunity to work alongside a female mentor at CEO, director or partner level across several trades in which women continue to be underrepresented at the top.Projects and communications assistant Hannah Magorrian said: ldquoAfter spending the day with mentors, the students develop their leadership skills in school, leading initiatives including mental health, peer mentoring, photography, sport, music, drama, debating, literacy, creative writing, religion and coding.ldquoThe school hopes these pupil-led initiatives will provide a legacy that benefits the whole school and wider community.ldquoIn line with the ethos at the heart of Assumption Grammar School, the pupils have already spent time with female leaders in local charities.She continued: ldquoThe school is currently working with its sister Assumption schools in South Africa to develop a parallel initiative with the aim of empowering African girls to become future leaders.ldquoThis global aspect of the SistersIN programme is reaching out to a country where females are vastly underrepresented at senior management and executive levels.The SistersIN Female Leadership Programme is being piloted in Assumption Grammar School this year, in association with Women in Business.Pupils will have two further leadership experience days, working with female leaders, on February  and June  when they will gain a dferent experience of leadership from one of over  partner industries..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Celebration.jpg","title":"Celebration time for Aughlisnafin  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN GAC held their annual presentations and dinner in the Burrendale Hotel last Saturday evening with Armagh and Crossmaglen Rangers legend Oisin McConville as the special guest.Major awards were as follows: seniors mdash managerrsquos player of the year, Donagh Steele managerrsquos sportsperson, Sean Fitzsimmons playersrsquo player, Donagh Steele.Minors mdash managerrsquos player, Morgan Croskery managerrsquos sportsperson, Peter OrsquoHare playersrsquo player, Ben Ogle.Senior players Oran Flanagan and Oisin OrsquoToole, received a commemorative league winners shield, on behalf of the squad, which has the names of every player and the management team engraved on it.The senior  and management team were also presented with league and championship medals and the minors were presented with their All County league medals.There were two recipients of the club person of the year award mdash chairperson Sheena Murray in recognition of an outstanding first term in her role and also Gerard Lenaghan in his role as coaching officer and PRO.The final award of the evening was presented to club vice-chairperson and senior player Rory Murphy in recognition of his outstanding contribution over the past  years.Oisin McConville was then invited to say a few words and spoke well with excellent advice for the future and encouraging rank and file members to put their shoulders to the wheel.There is much to do in a growing club and help is vital to sustain the clubrsquos development.

Many from Kilmegan and the surrounding areas tragically paid the ultimate price on a foreign field and are remembered in the book.Chapters on the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, the Troubles, the loyalist and IRA ceasefires and the Good Friday Agreement take the history of the parish into the modern age.Hundreds of hours of painstaking work researching historical documents and the archives of local newspapers, including those of the Down Recorder, were involved in the production of this book which will undoubtedly be regarded as an important point of reference for current and future generations.In a typically noble and generous gesture the Kilmegan and Maghera Historical Group have decided proceeds from the sale of the book will go to the Childrenrsquos Heartbeat Trust.Copies are now on sale at Walkersrsquo newsagents and JRrsquos Discount Stores, Castlewellan, with details of further points of sale on the Grouprsquos Facebook page, Kilmegan Maghera..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Jasmine.jpg","title":"Jasmine\u0027s first Christmas without a home  ","story":"JASMINE Carbery is one of the many unseen homeless people in Northern Ireland.She looks like any other young woman you may notice walking along Market Street in Downpatrick mdash bright, full of le and full of chat.Yet, at the young age of , she will spend Christmas at the Simon Community house in Saul Street away from her family for the first time.She moved into Saul Street in August after staying in the Newry Simon Community hostel a few months before that.Jasmine is one of three young women living in the Saul Street house.

I was working but then I needed to have some serious surgery on the back of my neck and I wasnrsquot able to work. Thatrsquos what led to the breakdown and I was asked to leave.What Jasmine says next is said in a calm, non-emotive manner.ldquoBecause I hadnrsquot been working, I didnrsquot have much money to contribute to the house. Also because I have two rare medical conditions, I had been on preion painkillers for them for over a year now. Irsquom actually addicted to them. It was probably another factor in why I was asked to leave.Jasmine was born with whatrsquos known as a Chiari malformation, a condition in which brain tissue extends into the spinal canal as well as Syringomyeli, another condition where a cyst or cavity forms in the spinal canal.Her recent surgery was to correct the growth of her brain into the top of her spine.She adds: ldquoWhile I was living in Craigavon, I was going out with a guy who was a drug dealer but I had never taken drugs before that. When I became homeless, I started taking drugs, mainly cocaine and tablets, as they were all around me.ldquoI suppose itrsquos a bit of an escape as well as many people see homelessness as rock bottom. But the prescription painkiller addiction would be my biggest problem and I suffer really badly with my mental health.Jasmine relationship with her relatives is still fragile, although there has been some infrequent communication between them.Living in a hostel has had some high and low points for her.ldquoSimon Community hostels are used as bail hostels but they are not exclusive to just prisoners, she said. ldquoI have never been in jail, never been arrested and would be classed as a vulnerable person.ldquoYou donrsquot really know who you are living with in a hostel as therersquos all sorts of people. That makes you more apprehensive.ldquoMy experience is that there have been predominantly male residents in the two hostels I have lived in. I was the only girl in about - fellas in the Newry hostelrsquos main building, so that took a bit of getting used to and was quite scary. Here is smaller, so itrsquos not as bad.ldquoBut the staff are amazing here. They go above and beyond their job description for you. They will sit and talk with you, watch the TV with you, play a board game, cook for us, everything we need.Jasmine left school at  with some qualications and has been told she is bright, but she has not been able to complete other educational courses, mostly due to her medical condition.However, she has recently been working with the human rights charity, Participation and the Practice of Rights, to help others know their entitlement in seeking social housing.She is being supported in the hostel for her problems and will be soon working with an Community Addiction worker.Jasmine has some goals for the New Year ahead which she hopes to achieve, again with the support of the Simon Community team.ldquoI would love to get my own place, thatrsquos my number one priority, she said. ldquoI would like not to be taking drugs and I also would like to reconnect with my family and get back into some education..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th November 2019 Lecale.jpg","title":"Lecale and Downe Historical Society launches annual publication  ","story":"THE Lecale and Downe Historical Society launched its th annual journal at the Down County Museum last week.Lecale Review No , has proved to be another excellent mix of compelling articles of local interest, published just in time for Christmas.The latest annual charters the history of one of the oldest racecourses in the world outside Downpatrick.The story penned by Joan Magee, lsquoHorse Racing At the Flying Horsersquo tells how a handful of gentry held a horse race around  but little  is known of the occasion.Within  years, the Earl of Ardglass and other noblemen petitioned King James II to set up a Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders within the county.All its members were to be known as Freemen and it had the power to meet in Downpatrick or some other Co Down town every Tuesday of Easter week.As well as having permission to race, the corporation was also permitted to hold a horse fair too.Joan explains that a race transpired at the Flying Horse, Downpatrick, on March ,  and is especially signicant as this race marked the beginning of what is one of the earliest flat racing courses in the world.The winner was Colonel Byerley, who fought at the Battle of the Boyne four months later against the platersquos donor ndash King James II.Another interesting article written by Colm Rooney charts the history of cinema within Downpatrick.Colm reveals that while Belfast had over two dozen cinemas, Downpatrick finally welcomed its first, the Pavilion Picture Theatre in St Patrickrsquos Avenue, at a glitzy opening ceremony on Wednesday June , .It was a huge event for local entrepreneur, Downpatrick man, William Tweedie who watched as locals queued up to pay over one shilling to see the Prisoner of Zenda, the first movie ever shown in the cinema.The cinema later moved to Market Street in the early s with the Breen family taking over the running of the business around , which ran until the s.Another article, Downpatrick by Gaslight, written by Andy Gilmore, reflects on the journey of natural gas over the centuries in Downpatrick.Andy points out that the use of town gas in Ireland dates back to  when gas for lighting streets and homes began to be produced from coal.However, it wasnrsquot until , and a concerted effort by the townsfolk that led to the foundation of a gas company that brought the energy source to Downpatrick.A site on Market Street was agreed for the gasworks in  and it opened later that year.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

Bamford Bus Company says it is “currently determining the size and composition of the workforce required for its future plans, but the  staff retained by the joint administrators have transferred to Bamford Bus Company”. Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were last month appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Meanwhile, in a separate deal, Jans Composites Limited has also agreed the purchase of Wright Composites Limited for an undisclosed sum. “Three staff members who were retained by the joint administrators, have transferred with the business.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/buil1.jpg","title":"nine storey office scheme for belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew A new proposed nine-storey office building in the heart of Belfast city centre could house up to  workers once completed, Ulster Business can reveal. There are now plans to build the grade A office building at Victoria Street. It would see the current Chancery House building knocked down to make way for the development. In , the building was sold off in excess of its guide price of £.m following a competitive bidding process. Chancery House, which is located on the edge of Belfast’s Law Courts and opposite Victoria Square Shopping Centre, was purchased by a local private developer. The fresh planning application has been made by Chancery House Investments Ltd, which includes Northern Ireland businessman Darren Donnelly as a director. Its being designed by Todd Architects alongside planning consultancy Turley. The building would include more than , sq ft of grade A office space, and those behind it have said it “would assist in addressing an identied need in the marketplace for small office floor plates to primarily serve indigenous businesses which are expanding and want a city centre business location”. It also says the design of the development “has been carefully formulated and responds to the immediate context of the site and its surrounding”. “The proposals improve the setting of the Old Town Hall and define its location with a building which adds vibrancy to this important nodal point”. A design statement says the development could accommodate between - office workers. Speaking at the time of the sale of Chancery House, Neil McShane, director at Lambert Smith Hampton, who the sale process, said: “Chancery House represented a unique opportunity in that it is an income-producing investment property with exciting development prospects. The prime location and secure tenant means that it will continue to perform well as an office investment but,redeveloped, will attract signicant interest from potential occupiers.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
