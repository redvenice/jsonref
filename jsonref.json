Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, eventually spending two years in England and completing Exodus as well as follow-up album Kaya (pictured at the Hammersmith Odeon, London in 1977)Zephaniah, said: \u0027It\u0027s very difficult to say what Bob Marley would have said about this plaque, but he did once say, Live for yourself, you will live in vain, live for others, and you will live again, so I\u0027m quite sure he would say that this is for his people and his music.\u0027Blue plaques commemorate the link between a location and an inidual who was regarded as \u0027eminent\u0027 in their field.Their achievements should have made an \u0027exceptional impact in terms of public recognition\u0027, and they must have been dead for at least 20 years.Other musicians to have received the honour include John Lennon, Freddie Mercury and Mozart. During his time at the house, Marley and his bandmates often played football at the pitches in nearby Battersea Park. Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976, eventually spending two years in England and completing Exodus as well as follow-up album Kaya.Exodus stayed on the album charts in the UK for 56 weeks in a row, spawning the hit singles Exodus, Waiting in Vain, Jamming and One Love.The Jamaican icon was also arrested during his stay in London and convicted for possessing a small quantity of cannabis.            Installed on buildings around London by English Heritage, the blue plaques celebrate the link between famous and influential figures and the places where they lived or worked in London. Pictured, some of those receiving the plaques this yearMarley performed at the Crystal Palace Bowl on June 7, 1980 while gravely ill. It would prove to be his last appearance in the UK, with the legendary musician dying less then a year later.   The cultural icon already has two blue plaques in London, including at a house he stayed at in Neasden, north west London, and Flat 34 Ridgmount Gardens in central London, the place where he first stayed in the capital.Mr Olusoga, English Heritage trustee and blue plaques panel member, said: \u0027Bob Marley was the first superstar to emerge from the developing world. More than a brilliant musician, he became a cultural icon who blazed a trail for other black artists.\u0027Traveller and diplomat Gertrude Bell and novelist Angela Carter are among several other famous figures commemorated with blue plaques this year.Mr Olusoga added: \u0027From engineering to music, this year\u0027s blue plaques remind us of the enormous range of human achievement.\u0027All of our blue plaque recipients called London home, at least for a while, and our plaques are a testament to the creativity and variety of this city.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"UK weather Rising waters trap Isle Man residents homes","story":"Share this article Northern Rail said the Maryport to Carlisle line was badly affected with replacement buses operating in some sections.

Kemp starred alongside ex-EastEnders actress Michelle Collins as Wells\u0027 wife Kathy\u0027We had loads of laughs.\u0027 She added that she can no longer remember the attractive personality which drew her to Wells.In December 2015 he proposed to her in front of her friends and family.However, the couple then had four weddings dates that were cancelled, but Hazel said she heard the alarm bells.\u0027You do hear the alarm bells but you don\u0027t want to recognise them, you don\u0027t want to believe it\u0027s true because you love this person.\u0027         His crime was later turned into an ITV movie called Can\u0027t Buy Me Love in 2004 starring Martin Kemp as the painterdecoratorHe cancelled the weddings due to business engagements and also blamed the deaths of people in his organisation.Wells asked Hazel for £2,000 shortly into the relationship and claimed he needed it because he couldn\u0027t get to a nearby bank.He borrowed £15,000 from her sister and £5,000 from her daughter and also took loans out in Hazel\u0027s name.\u0027He left me with so much debt, i\u0027m still paying debts from a loan of £10,000.\u0027 But when Wells kept going away Hazel became suspicious. \u0027There was always an excuse to go away. He told me to look for a £3million house and he came back to look at it.\u0027She finally decided enough was enough and ended it with Wells. A while after, a woman called Lynne called her and went on to inform her she had been living with Wells while the two had been dating. Last week South Yorkshire Police launched a manhunt for Wells more than 20 years after women came forward accusing him of tricking them out of their savings.Police said: \u0027The 61-year-old, who is originally from South Yorkshire, is wanted in connection with three high value romance frauds, during which three victims lost money totalling more than £400,000.\u0027The offences are reported to have taken place from September 2014 onwards.

provided within 21 days.Mr Milburn also rejected claims for the family to bring a doctor as a live witness to the inquest and instead ordered the family representation to provide a second statement from the doctor.The inquest heard how on one occasion, Clifford collapsed in the shower.The coroner referred to medical evidence which provided one doctor\u0027s view that he collapsed due to the symptoms of his condition rather than due to the shower.A date for the full inquest is yet to be set, although counsel asked the coroner to set a date before the end of the year which the coroner said

Here’s what the UK could have looked likeA pair of sleek white apartment blocks rise above the trees of Windsor Great Park. Their sharp concrete balconies and horizontal strip windows embody all the promise of modernity, just a stone’s throw from the spires of Eton and the turrets of Windsor Castle. As the developers of the complex put it in 1935, this was to be “the housing method of the future”, a place kitted out with all the latest mod cons: tennis and squash courts, swimming pool, skittle alley, Turkish bath and cinema room. With the option of housemaid service, as well as stabling for horses alongside the garage, it was billed as a place “for those who care for the country, whose manner of living is intelligent, and whose social standards are high”. The problem was, you had to like modern architecture, too – and most people in Britain didn’t.Isokon 3, this heady vision for Windsor designed by Bauhaus maestro Walter Gropius, never happened because the British public wasn’t ready for it. Despite the best efforts of its developer, Jack Pritchard, who received the blessing of King George V for the buildings to be erected overlooking his castle, there simply wasn’t enough demand for this new functionalist, wipe-clean world, freshly imported from the continent. Despite seductive brochures offering “all the amenities of living that are to be found in a really comfortable country house … at a price which is very much less than the cost of living in a country house of your own”, the project never got off the ground. Neither did a similar Gropius-designed scheme in Birmingham.The delicate watercolour renderings and sales brochure are all that remain of the dream, now on show at the RIBA in a new exhibition, Beyond Bauhaus: Modernism in Britain 1933–66, marking the centenary of the radical German art school and its impact on British architecture. The show casts a necessarily broad net, given our introverted island wasn’t particularly receptive to the radical cocktail of machine-made functionalism, abstraction and socialism. Gropius was joined in London by artist László Moholy-Nagy and designer Marcel Breuer for just three years, taking refuge from Nazi Germany in the first (and only) Isokon apartment building in Hampstead, before they all moved on in 1937. It is painfully symbolic that the first items in the exhibition are the menu cards from their farewell dinners, and a photograph of them happily leaving Britain for the US.’s own contemporary coverage is also telling. In a 1930 interview with Gropius (spelt with a lower-case “g” throughout the article, because “various modern architects and artists do not use capital letters”), he remarks that “only in England and Spain has this architectural style few adherents”. The newspaper’s scientific correspondent reported: “He thinks the Americans will develop this style of modern architecture most successfully. They are not so inidualistically conservative as Western Europeans.” Gropius was being diplomatic. Later, he would write of Britain as a “land of fog and emotional nightmares”.Still, the RIBA’s curators have done their best to suggest that the Bauhäuslers had a good time here, gave many lectures and made lots of influential friends. They’ve had a thorough rummage through their copious archives and put together an illuminating show that not only documents the little-known output (built and unbuilt) of the Bauhaus three on these shores, but also traces the evolution of Britain’s own homegrown brand of modernity.Along with Gropius’s unrealised plans for Windsor, another highlight is Marcel Breuer’s “Garden City of the Future”, a utopian scheme he produced for the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1936, in collaboration with FRS Yorke, which looks like the result of Ebenezer Howard on acid. Gone are the garden city movement’s familiar arts-and-craftsy cottages arranged along radial avenues instead, we find gigantic concrete ziggurat shopping centres, Y-shaped apartment blocks and curious amoebic pavilions. It was a high-density, mixed-use urban plan designed, said the architects, so that “a man can spend, in the open air, at rest or sport, the hour he must at present waste in travel to or from his work”.It duly inspired furious letters to the , along the lines of “this isn’t British”, but it also provided a fertile source for others to mine. The outward-stepping courtyard shopping building, supported by great angled buttresses, clearly influenced the form of James Stirling’s 1966 project for Queen’s College in Oxford, while Breuer would go on to recycle a number of the ideas in later buildings, from France to Argentina.Elsewhere, we see how the hard lines and sharp corners of the Bauhaus style were softened by their arrival on British soil. Another fascinating yet little-known Breuer project is the Gane Pavilion, once again designed with FRS Yorke, for the Royal Agricultural Show in Bristol in 1936. Looking more like a Californian Case Study House from the 1950s, it incorporated massive masonry walls made of roughly squared Cotswold stone, topped with a projecting flat roof, enclosing a free-flowing domestic interior lined with plywood. It was a kind of rustic Bauhaus, the utilitarian ideology safely wrapped in a cosy blanket of rural Englishness, with even a nod to our national obsession of being “in keeping”.Practical constraints had unexpected aesthetic impacts, too. The widespread lack of central heating in British homes in the 1930s prompted Breuer to move away from the tubular steel furniture designs that he had developed at the Bauhaus and adopt the warmer potentials of wood. “Plywood ahoy!” he wrote in a letter to Gropius as he left Germany for England, anticipating the furniture designs he would produce for Isokon, including the famous Long Chair and a plywood dining table, both of which have spawned countless imitations since. Similarly, Gropius’s Wood House in Kent, built with Maxwell Fry in 1937, an oak-framed building clad in cedar boarding, anticipates the house he would go on to build for himself in Massachusetts, and presages the kind of timber-clad suburban modernism that would later take root in various aspirational corners of leafy England.But, in the main, the exhibition gives the impression that we didn’t get a grip on what the Bauhaus evangelists were preaching until long after they’d left. Gropius’s Impington College in Cambridgeshire, built in 1939, by which time he was ensconced at Harvard, is perhaps the most important single work in this regard. Separating out the various components of the building in the landscape, with classrooms arranged to maximise daylight, it would go on to inspire the nature of most British state schools of the postwar era.There is a good section on the role of the county architects in developing these ideas, with a particular focus on the pioneering Hertfordshire schools programme. It highlights Mary Crowley’s designs for the first school in Cheshunt in 1949, and the evolution of the standardised prefabricated system, which would be adopted across the country by the 70s – finally realising an ideal that the Bauhaus had first espoused half a century earlier.As we stand poised to break ties with EU, the exhibition provides a useful reminder of the progressive values that outsiders can bring to Britain, however little we welcome them at the time.• Beyond Bauhaus: Modernism in Britain 1933–66 is at RIBA Architecture gallery, London, until 1 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03fac67cbb24fb331aea79de32a5bc481da1a5b7/0_212_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ff95ff90457c28c0dc783b2fdce1065","title":"va to close raphael cartoons gallery for major revamp","story":"Project planned for 2020 will show Renaissance treasures in unprecedented detailOne of the UK’s most dramatic gallery spaces, which displays the Raphael Cartoons, is to close temporarily to allow the first major refurbishment in more than 25 years.On Tuesday the Victoria and Albert Museum in London announced details of a project planned for most of 2020 which it said would allow visitors to see artworks which are considered among the greatest treasures of the Renaissance in more detail than ever before.The cartoons are designs commissioned in 1515 by Pope Leo X for a series of tapestries in the Sistine Chapel illustrating the lives of St Peter and St Paul. Seven of 10 survive and were brought to Britain in the 17th century by the Prince of Wales, later Charles I.They remained in the royal collection until Queen Victoria loaned them to the South Kensington Museum in 1865 in memory of Prince Albert. They have remained stars of the museum, now the V\u0026ampA, ever since.The gallery where they hang was originally designed for the museum’s Indian art collection. In 1950 the cartoons were transferred there and it has proved “the perfect space” said Ana Debenedetti, the lead curator of the Raphael Project.“It has almost the same dimensions as the Sistine Chapel, only 2 sq metres of difference. It is a dramatic gallery which allows a meditative feeling and this is really what we want to enhance.”The Raphael Court was last refurbished between 1992-96 and a refresh was due, given that the natural lifecycle of such spaces is 25 years.The fact that 2020 is the the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death gave an added impetus.Debenedetti said the new gallery would have state-of-the art lighting and a darker colour on the walls to help focus visitors’ eyes on the cartoons’ vibrant palette. There will also be enhanced interpretation including high-definition, infrared and 3D scans of the cartoons.Because the cartoons cannot be moved the work will go on around them from 27 January, with the hope of being completed by October. That would coincide with a major show planned by the National Gallery to open on 3 October.Debenedetti said the seven cartoons, each measuring 5 metres wide and 3.5 metres high, were “a unique Renaissance treasure, both in terms of aesthetic value and technical achievement”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3392cdf83cdceacba8d22d87f1fd5fa6963ab4b/0_72_1348_808/master/1348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de02aaa2def53de6549aaf8c4605b277","title":"the fantasy figures of txema yeste in pictures","story":"Born in Spain, Yeste began his career working for newspapers.

Help us choose a bookOn 22 October, it will be 100 years since the birth of Doris Lessing. That’s a good reason to revisit the work of the award winning British-Zimbabwean novelist here on the Reading group. In a career ning more than 50 years, Lessing wrote dozens of works of fiction and biography, in many different genres and moods, and was shortlisted for – and won – most of the major literary awards in Europe. She won the Nobel prize in literature in 2007, when the Swedish Academy described her as “that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a ided civilisation to scrutiny”. The word “epicist” means “epic poet”, which possibly fits Lessing in the broader sense of the term, even if the poetry she wrote had a quieter impact than her novels.At 88, Lessing was the oldest author to receive the honour. She was also one of the most nonplussed. “Oh Christ,” she said when a reporter on her doorstep told her she’d won. On further reflection she said: “I’m sure you’d like some uplifting remarks of some kind … It’s been going on now for 30 years, one can get more excited … I’ve won all the prizes in Europe – every bloody one. I’m delighted to have won them all. The whole lot.”In 2007, Robert McCrum saluted her in the Observer as a writer “who has dedicated her long life and impressive body of work to the tireless and unflinching exploration of man’s (and woman’s) place in the world, together with issues of race, gender and social justice. This prize finally acknowledges what has been true for at least 40 years: that she is one of the most important literary voices of her generation.”McCrum noted that her work was mainly read by people over the age of 35. Presumably, those readers are now over 47. It’s hard to tell how many younger readers have been picking her up since. I myself read The Grass Is Singing, first published in 1950, around the time of the Nobel announcement and promised to read “more Lessing”. It’s not just the appalling joke that makes me redden but that I haven’t read any of her books since. This is a good chance, for me anyway, to put that right and celebrate this astonishing writer.The only question is which book to read. Her work includes furious takedowns of colonialism and apartheid, explorations of female inner space such as in The Golden Notebook and outer space in books like Canopus in Argos. Lessing poured scorn on the idea that she could be pigeonholed. She had been given “every conceivable label. I started off as a writer about the colour bar, and then I was a communist, then a feminist, then a mystic.’ And now? What I always was. Just the same.”Her extensive bibliography may be one reason why her work so impressed the Nobel committee. Let’s take a vote and choose the book that is most often nominated in the comments below as this month’s Reading group choice.

Talking at a Reuters Newsmaker event on Tuesday, O’Leary was blunt about the the package holiday market, saying it was “screwed, it’s over”.He argued that the CAA had done well to bring back hundreds of thousands of stranded passengers, but needed to do more to prevent airline failures in the first place.“The CAA should be much more aggressive in requiring the shareholders of those companies to put up much more cash to get through the year, rather than allowing them to continually fail.”He said Ryanair would wait for “the next turn in the cycle” before ordering more Boeing or Airbus jets at cheaper prices.The Irish carrier is one of the biggest customers of Boeing’s grounded 737 Max aircraft, with 135 firm aircraft orders and 75 options, and O’Leary said the company could add Airbus jets to its fleet in the medium term.He also said the UK’s departure from the EU would have no long-term impact on Ryanair. “The UK’s national interest is best served, I think, by staying in the EU,” he said. “It’s nuts to leave it, but if you are going to leave, the first thing you’ve got to do on the day after you leave is renegotiate a trade deal with the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c6140f8396864116a704aced984339d16beead/0_9_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6e1e2a4e09dc6104acad7d583368572","title":"uk house pricesno deal brexit nationwide london","story":"House prices in Britain unexpectedly fell last month amid mounting fears over the impact of no-deal Brexit on the property market.With just 30 days until Britain’s scheduled departure date from the EU with little sign of a breakthrough in the deadlock with Brussels, analysts said property buyers and sellers were delaying their decisions amid the uncertainty.Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: “With the economy largely struggling and the outlook highly uncertain, we suspect that house prices will remain soft in the near term at least.”Analysts said continued uncertainty over Brexit would continue to weigh on house price growth across the country. Prices also remain unaffordable for many younger buyers after rising significantly over the past decade at a time of stalling wage rises.Sam Mitchell, the chief executive of online estate agent Housesimple, said: “It’s hard to say what the next month will have in store.

However, it remains below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The impact of such Brexit-related stock building was dwarfed by weakening demand for other customers, due in part to clients routing supply chains away from the UK.”Manufacturing output across the developed the world has slumped in recent months amid the continuing US-China trade war, which has sapped business investment and depressed export demand. Manufacturing output in the eurozone has dropped to the lowest levels in seven years, dragging major countries such as Italy and Germany to the brink of recession.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.In a sign of the continuing downturn in UK manufacturing, firms said that output, new orders, and export business all fell in September. Employment levels also fell at the fastest pace in six years, with around 8,000 jobs lost in September, up from around 6,000 in August.Against a backdrop of mounting political turmoil in recent months, UK firms have begun redoubling their efforts to prepare for a potentially damaging no-deal Brexit at the end of October.Greggs, the high street bakery chain, said on Tuesday it is taking steps to build up stocks of key ingredients and equipment that could be affected.It has rented warehouse space and will begin stockpiling some longer-life products sourced from Europe, such as bacon and tuna. It has also begun sourcing all its cheese and most of its sugar in the UK to avoid potential disruption.Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said the company would not be able to replace delicate foodstuffs such as tomatoes and lettuce and would have to switch to alternatives or stop selling products which used items held up by problems at ports.Some firms have also started stockpiling beer, wine and spirits to keep the alcohol flowing at Christmas. Analysts have warned that the Brexit deadline comes as warehousing activity ramps up ahead of the festive season, making planning for both events harder for businesses.Firms across the UK had rushed to stockpile before the original Brexit deadline on 29 March, providing a boost to economic growth earlier this year. Companies then opted to run down supplies after Theresa May delayed the deadline until the end of October, dragging down economic output, taking Britain to the brink of recession.James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said the boost was unlikely to be as significant the second time around, adding: “Inventory levels are still perceived to be fairly high, but also warehousing space is becoming more constrained given the close proximity to Black Friday and Christmas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318b466cd7df4b71079683e9f955dea2726ad4ab/0_468_3918_2350/master/3918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4723a60ea4fcde59593709cdba7a455d","title":"crispin odey denies backing no deal brexit shorting opportunity","story":"Hedge fund manager says he is optimistic about UK and claims as to motivations are ‘rubbish’Crispin Odey, the hedge fund manager who is a leading backer of a no-deal Brexit and Boris Johnson, has dismissed claims his support is motivated by an opportunity to make millions from short-selling UK companies and the pound as “absolute rubbish”.Odey told the  he was optimistic about the prospects for the UK after Brexit, denied influencing strategy at No 10 and said his fund had an overall “neutral” position on UK stocks.The founder of Odey Asset Management said he had spoken to Boris Johnson only once since he became Conservative leader, “two days after, to say congratulations”. He added: “I am an observer. When it comes to his strategy, I am not involved.”Over the weekend, the former chancellor, Philip Hammond, questioned the political connections of some hedge fund managers backing a no-deal Brexit, and the former permanent secretary to the Treasury Nick Macpherson argued he was right to do so. Responding to the criticisms on Monday, Odey said: “It’s absolute rubbish. It really is. Politics doesn’t drive markets. Markets are very bad at observing political events because they are not monetary.In response to an urgent question from Labour in the House of Commons, the government rejected claims from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, that Johnson risked a conflict of interest if a no-deal Brexit benefited his friends and donors.“Isn’t there a danger the promotion of a no-deal scare by the prime minister, resulting in profiteering by his friends and donors, could be seen as a conflict of interest by any standard and contrary to the ministerial code?” McDonnell asked.Odey donated £10,000 to Johnson’s Conservative leadership campaign and has given almost £900,000 to pro-Brexit campaigns in the past. The wealth of Odey and his wife, Nichola Pease, has been put at £775m by the Sunday Times rich list.Odey said he supported holding a general election, arguing “the problem is that this parliament was never set up to deal with Brexit”.A fresh election, he said, might result in a parliament that was “more closely aligned to opinion in the country, so not 80:20 but 50:50. It is not good for the country that we live on a knife edge every single day and everyone wants to postpone.”“Most people’s view of the UK is that ‘it’s not going to get any better’. My view is that, if we get out, we will have all this invigoration of things we have got to do, including reforming the constitution. There are parts to the constitution that need reform, including the upper house, which is far too large,” he said.“The idea that Boris is a tyrant doesn’t make sense, if you look at the experience of his time as mayor of London. He is an enterprise man.”Asked why Hammond and Macpherson might question his motives, Odey responded: “It’s the deep state. They are feeling, for the first time, a little bit frustrated.”He backed a no-deal Brexit, he said, because alternative methods of leaving the EU would lumber the UK with the equivalent of unattractive “non-voting shares”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5b20e566a28d4641ae519d391138829f547f713/0_246_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=427e448c5d2478e28b1701ec17a1481a","title":"uk house prices brexit factory output eurozone business live","story":"British manufacturers are cutting employment levels at the fastest pace since 2013, despite a renewed surge in stockpilingTime for a quick recap of the main points.High street bakers Greggs has revealed that its Brexit contingency plans (mentioned earlier) includes changing some of its recipes.Bloomberg has the details:If there are any disruptions at ports, “we’ll be able to last a few days and then hopefully it will settle down,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on a call with reporters as the company reported a slowdown in sales growth that prompted a fall in the shares.“Should there be any short-term pressures on some ingredients then there are alternative recipe suggestions we can fall back to.”Greggs has already tried to reduce its dependency on European suppliers, sourcing more of its cheese and sugar from U.K.-based companies. It has also brought forward purchases of trucks from continental Europe to limit the effect of any delays at the borders on its own distribution network.“A lot of what we sell clearly has a level of substitution involved,” Whiteside said. “People won’t go without food. They’ll make different food choices dependent on what’s available.”Just in: A no-deal Brexit would increase the risk that Japanese carmaker Nissan closes its Sunderland car plant.The Financial Times is reporting that Nissan will review its decision to build the Qashqai sport utility vehicle at its Sunderland plant if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.If Sunderland lost the Qashqai contract, it could lead to the eventual closure of the site, the FT fears.Here’s a flavour of their story:The Japanese carmaker pledged in November 2016 to build the SUV in the UK, safeguarding thousands of jobs, after its then chairman Carlos Ghosn received assurances from the government that its operations would be protected from the impact of Brexit.But following last year’s ousting of Mr Ghosn and a collapse in profits, Nissan has undertaken a global review that makes everything including the Sunderland plant vulnerable to downsizing or closure.The carmaker’s decision to manufacture in the UK was contingent on a “soft” Brexit that includes a trade deal or transition arrangement, a decision that it would reassess if Britain leaves the EU without any deal, according to two people familiar with its original investment decision. Here’s a handy couple of charts showing how trade growth, and the expanding Chinese economy, have risen hand in hand.There’s a major shake-up under way at the John Lewis Partnership.One in three senior management HQ jobs are being cut, as it effectively merges the running of its supermarkets (Waitrose) and department stores (John Lewis).Some good news: Belfast shipyard Harland and Wolff has been saved from closure, by a London-based energy firm.The historic shipyard went into administration in August after its Norwegian parent company collapsed.But InfraStrata, which works on projects such as the Islandmagee underground gas storage plant off the coast of Country Antrim, said it planned to retain the 79 staff still employed at the yard and potentially employ hundreds more.The Unite union praised the company’s workers for fighting to keep it alive, including a nine-week sit-in protest that was designed to raise awareness about its plight.The WTO has also provided these charts, which show clearly that trade growth has levelled out since summer 2018 -- when Donald Trump imposed the first tranche of tariffs on China.Here are the key points from the WTO’s new trade forecasts, which are rather gloomier than three months ago:The World Trade Organisation has slashed its forecast for global trade growth to its lowest in a decade, and Brexit is partly to blame.It cited the weakening global economy, the ongoing trade dispute between China and America, and Brexit-related uncertainty.“The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected. Beyond their direct effects, trade conflicts heighten uncertainty, which is leading some businesses to delay the productivity-enhancing investments that are essential to raising living standards.“Job creation may also be hampered as firms employ fewer workers to produce goods and services for export.”Brexit stockpiling might give factories a short-term boost, but it’s not very good for the economy as a whole.It means that firms are holding onto more raw materials than they’d like, tying up precious capital that could be used more productively elsewhere. It also distracts from longer-term planning.Lee Collinson, head of manufacturing at Barclays, explains:Some parts of the sector have started to build up inventories again as the 31st October Brexit deadline looms large. The knock-on effect is that this activity is erting valuable funds away from much-needed investment projects.To make matters worse, a growing global economic slowdown is increasingly casting a shadow over the sector coupled with reports that some EU-based clients are moving supply chains away from the UK.There’s another problem with stockpiling - you literally have to put the stuff somewhere.Last week, Bloomberg’s Lucy Meakin spoke to a fruit crisp manufacturer who bought 24 tonnes (!) of beetroot ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March. That meant paying for expensive refrigerated storage, which they’d rather not do again. Stephen Cooper, Head of Industrial Manufacturing at KPMG UK, says today’s UK manufacturing PMI report is pretty bad.Firms should check they have enough working capital to ride out the slowdown, he warns, saying “We expected grim news from this month’s UK Manufacturing PMI readings and that unfortunately came to fruition, albeit with marginal improvement on last month’s performance. “A backdrop of global trade wars, Brexit uncertainty and concerns regarding the slowing global economic growth continue to weigh heavily on the industry, with Europe, our leading trading partner, far from immune. Indeed Europe posted their worst performance since October 2012. “Lower orders for new work, job losses and reduced investment levels due to prolonged uncertainty paints a rather bleak set of conditions which are unlikely to abate any time soon. This reinforces the importance for manufacturers to ensure that their working capital and supply chains are as robust as possible to weather these challenging times.”Steve Harris of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking says some UK factories are focused on short-term Brexit problems, rather than looking further ahead:“Short-term Brexit headwinds continue to dominate domestically, but it is clear that weaker international demand and trade wars globally are impacting on growth. The danger remains this causes manufacturers to hold back investment and become myopic losing sight of medium and long-term growth opportunities.Encouragingly, anecdotal feedback and our own research suggests this isn’t happening everywhere, but that doesn’t remove the fact resources are being applied to short-term planning to tackle the immediate challenges.Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, fears that the UK manufacturing sector is sliding into recession.Here’s his take on today’s PMI report:Output, new orders and employment all fell further as rising political, trade and economic uncertainties exacerbated concerns about Brexit.“The rate of job losses accelerated to a six-and-a- half-year high, highlighting how manufacturers are increasingly seeking to cut costs. Similarly, the investment goods sector was especially hard hit in September, seeing the sharpest drops in production and new business, as clients reined in capital spending while conditions remained volatile.

Old, male intellectuals in France have been farting on because she is not “sexy” enough. Yes, really. The 84-year-old philosopher Bernard Pivot, the president of the Académie Goncourt, a French literary society, talked of the sexy Swedish girls of his youth. Greta does not match up, apparently.

Now I’ve illustrated a whole children’s book about themThe surinam toad is an unusual creature to behold: it has an extremely flat, splat-like body, with a posterior packed with large pores full of babies. It’s as though somewhere during evolution, it took a wrong turn – and then got run over.But of course, the adaptation has an intelligent purpose. By carrying her eggs on her back, the mother is able to lay flat against her surroundings, protecting her spawn from predators until they are ready for the world.If you suffer from trypophobia (the fear of small, tightly packed holes), look away now.The surinam toad is a perfect example of one of my obsessions: ugly animals. What may be a distressingly hideous feature to humans often belies evolutionary genius, which fascinates me so much that I wrote and illustrated a whole children’s book full of them.Most people spend their lives avoiding being associated with anything regarded as “ugly” I find myself being drawn towards them. And drawing them.I’m 23 now but I grew up in my family’s home just outside of Port Macquarie in Australia, in the rural suburb of Sancrox. From an early age I found so much joy in the weird and wonderful creatures around me, from the frequent visits of Antechinus marsupials to the bandy-bandy snakes, goannas in the garden, and possums in the trees. We had a vast range of pets too – miniature ponies and donkeys, among them.Our home was always decorated with paintings by Mum, and my sister and I were fortunate enough to inherit her artistic skill. I wasn’t sure what to do with it after studying art in high school – until Mum came across a unique course: I could get a bachelor’s degree in natural history illustration.During my honours year I researched the connections between conservation and aesthetics, to discover the impact of an animal’s appearance on how willing humans were to assist with its survival.Large and impressive animals found in safari parks or reservations, including tigers, lions and elephants, are considered “charismatic megafauna” owing to their popularity with the public. As a result, they tend to receive more press, better benefits and more donations – while less popular or “ugly” animals are left behind.In his 2011 article, The New Noah’s Ark, the Canadian veterinary research scientist Ernie Small compared the $2m Coca-Cola had committed to save polar bears – and the $125m commitment to the whooping crane made by a joint Canada-US recovery plan – with money promised to help endangered frogs and toads, who receive nowhere near that much.“Aesthetic and commercial standards have become the primary determinants of which species in the natural world deserve conservation,” he wrote. “Accordingly, the world’s bioersity is being beautified by selective conservation of attractive species, while the plight of the overwhelming majority of species is receiving limited attention.”Species that possess human tendencies, infant-like features, vibrant colours, symmetry and impressive proportion – or offer something we can use, such as food, medicine or clothing – are almost always going to appeal more to us. But an animal like the endangered aye-aye suffers in comparison.To draw the aye-aye, one must take into consideration their coarse fur, bulging eyes, scrawny single finger and over-all rat-like appearance, while keeping the superstition that surrounds it in the back of one’s mind: if an aye-aye points at you with its long finger, the legend goes, you’ve been cursed with an imminent death.It sounds ridiculous, but myths like these have a direct impact on their population. We need to understand this incredible species, not be afraid of it we need to educate others on why the creature has evolved like this. It is one of only a few species to use a technique called “percussive foraging”: their large ears help them hear insects inside the trees their sharp teeth gnaw holes in the wood and their eerily long index finger and claw helps them spear grubs found in the holes they’ve made, for a tasty meal.The helmeted hornbill is another one: critically endangered owing to land clearing for palm oil plantations, and poaching for its magnificent red ivory casque. In West Kalimantan, 6,000 birds were killed for trade purposes in 2013 alone, to create carved ornaments and jewellery from their horns.The helmeted hornbill is wonderful to illustrate, with its enormous size, outrageous beak and textured neck. I used a range of painting techniques to capturethis weird yet wonderful bird.I hope my book will introduce others to a broader range of species – and help us care about them, regardless of how they look.• The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Ugly Animals by Sami Bayly is out now through LothianHachette"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05160bcc989f986e2990ea4d17496b1675450bd/0_105_4084_2450/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232829f6ae624063bd30345b02ec81fc","title":"traitors remoaners civil servant brexit language","story":"There is a clear link between the provocative language used by ministers and other politicians and the increase of threats to public figures. Everyone knows it, which is why politicians of every stripe have asked urgent questions in parliament that all focused on Boris Johnson’s use of inflammatory language as a deliberate strategy. Instead of answering them, junior minister Kevin Foster shrugged off the concerns, and relentlessly bridged back to what has become the Tory party conference motto: “get Brexit done”.Only after that, we are told, will the hate and the ision in our country subside, as if an election and a promised spending splurge could repair the damage that’s been done to our public square over three years.Civil servants don’t believe a word of it. A nasty, no-deal Brexit followed by an even nastier “people v parliament” election campaign will further imperil not just our public figures but our institutions too, with dire consequences for public services over the coming months.I see three main threats. First, Dominic Cummings. Remember what first triggered alarms about his appointment? He is a self-confessed shock doctor whose goals reach beyond Brexit and the winning of the next general election. Brexit’s dark lord has longer-term plans to change the whole way the business of government is delivered. The last few weeks of havoc provide us with ample evidence to suppose that his best hope for doing that starts with a disorientated, destabilised civil service.What’s the matter with these civil servants? Don’t they believe in Brexit? If they do, they shouldn’t. They are professionals whose task is to carry out government policies through plans built on logic and evidence, not Orwellian doublethink. But there is cause for concern: I recently came across a job description for a senior no-deal planning role in a Brexit-facing department – it told applicants that essential attributes were an “ability to handle complexity and ambiguity”. I’m the first to recognise that Operation Yellowhammer has actually done a lot to put in place plans for no-deal Brexit mitigation, even if it’s clear that they won’t be nearly enough. But more recent plans are disintegrating before our eyes.For example, assurances from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, about the flow of medicines were only last week contradicted by the National Audit Office. The ink was barely dry on Johnson’s press release about his £3bn investment in 40 hospitals before health experts found serious holes in the proposals. And Department for Education ministers are facing questions  over the very existence of its no-deal Brexit planning. Most of all, the government still refuses to be honest about the true cost of a no-deal Brexit.That’s why we need Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and the head of the civil service to mitigate the worst of the damage while he still can. He’s the government’s most senior non-political adviser and oversees, among other things, the ministerial code that governs the conduct of cabinet ministers, and the prime minister himself. He also may be the person who ends up asking the EU for a Brexit extension.Mark is a busy man. Just in the last couple of weeks, he has been asked to investigate the prime minister’s alleged sexual misconduct, as well as the claims that the Johnson’s backers will benefit from a no-deal Brexit.He is currently on a “listening tour”, according to his leaked letter to senior civil servants, which may explain why he’s been a bit quiet lately. But, whether in private or public, we need Mark to quickly take action – he alone has the mandate to ensure the civil service is in one piece for whatever happens after 31 October.

If so, Canada has it covered … Thanks to its combination of natural beauty and a widely varied landscape, Canada lends itself to a vast range of outdoor pursuits. As the world’s second-largest country and ning 10 provinces and three territories, it really does have something for everyone.Explore the lakes of OntarioPerfect for: unwinding in the sunWhen the Canadian summer hits, Ontario cottage country is the place to be. Think lazy days gazing out at picture-perfect views, jumping off docks into the cool waters of crystal-clear lakes, boat cruises, kayaking, barbecues out on the deck, and above all, unwinding to the point of total relaxation. Among the many canoeing opportunities, paddling a voyager canoe on the Mattawa River stands out. Pretend you’re a fur trader by joining guides in a 30-foot craft, with the option to visit Talon Chute waterfall. Visiting Ontario is an experience you’ll want to return to again and again. With a wide choice of resorts available, you can ensure a unique stay every time, too.Mountain bike in Whistler, British ColumbiaPerfect for: thrill-seekersThe Whistler Blackcomb resort may be known as one of North America’s top skiing destinations, but when spring arrives and the snow melts, it transforms into something else: a playground for downhill mountain biking. Whistler Mountain Bike Park is accessible from Whistler Village by chairlift from mid-May to mid-October, and although the network of trails – ning 50 miles and 1,500 vertical metres (4,900 feet) – may seem daunting, the technical, tighter runs are balanced with smoother toboggan-like beginner zones, meaning you don’t have to be a pro to take on this adrenaline kick of an experience. It’s best to experience the trails yourself in June and September. When you’ve had your fill of two wheels, then enjoy a glass of wine in one of Canada’s largest wine regions.Celebrate Canada Day in Ottawa, OntarioPerfect for: fans of live musicWhere better to celebrate Canada Day than the country’s capital, Ottawa? Settle in at various spots around the city – Confederation Boulevard, Major’s Hill Park or the Ottawa River – and enjoy a full line-up of entertainment, including an air show courtesy of the Canadian armed forces, musical performances from the likes of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, followed by a fireworks display that’s sure to inspire Canadian pride, no matter where you’re from. There’s also free entry to national museums and art galleries.Try out cowboy skills on a ranch in AlbertaPerfect for: learning new skillsAlberta may be known for its iconic national parks (Banff has to be seen to be believed), but south of Banff has just as much to offer, in the form of cowboy country. With rolling foothills, vast cattle grounds, and sunsets that’ll stop you in your tracks, experience the cowboy lifestyle at one of the numerous working and guest ranches in the region. Saddle up for some cattle driving, help with daily chores, try your hand at horseshoe tossing, or opt for one of the more hotel-like guest ranches, with experiences such as horseback camping trips or even spa services on offer. Either way, you’re guaranteed a warm welcome, a break from the fast-pace of modern life, and an unforgettable stay. There are even half-day horse rides if you’re worried about being saddle sore.Go on a polar bear safari in Manitoba (and see the northern lights)Perfect for: adventurous animal-loversForget the Big Five – you’re in Canada now, and safari means one thing: polar bears. To see them in the wild you’ll need to head to Churchill, Manitoba – a region perfectly placed for spotting the iconic (and endangered) white bears in their natural environment, as they wait on the shore for the Hudson Bay freeze before heading out to hunt for seals. Several tour operators offer excursions in adapted vehicles out into the Arctic tundra, with one-day trips or longer expeditions available. It’s not just polar bears that make this a once-in-a-lifetime trip either, because Churchill is also one of the best places in the world to see the northern lights. A two-for-one deal, if you will.Spend a night at the Hotel de Glace in QuebecPerfect for: stepping out of your comfort zoneDrive a few hours out of the historic Quebec city and you’ll find a hotel that’s a little on the chilly side of things. Why? Because it’s made out of ice. You’ll need to time your stay within a very specific window though: Hôtel de Glace is constructed in January and melts away in March each year. Because, you know, ice. With 44 rooms, a chapel, ice bar and even slides, this construction is a work of art and engineering as well as a place to rest your head (day visitors also welcome). Don’t worry about freezing in your sleep either – while the various sofas, chairs and tables are carved out of ice, beds feature soft (and warm!) mattresses, with duvets to boot.Catch and eat lobster in Atlantic CanadaPerfect for: foodiesWhen it comes to Nova Scotia, it doesn’t get more authentic than heading out into the waters of the North Atlantic with an experienced fisherman to catch your own lobster, before enjoying an on-board seafood boil. If fishing isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy the rewards without the work – especially if you’re planning to visit in February, which sees Nova Scotia’s South Shore Lobster Crawl festival take place along the shore each year. A lobster-lover’s dream, it includes an abundance of events, including the best lobster roll challenge. Yum.Visit Iceberg Alley on the Newfoundland coastPerfect for: lovers of the natural worldFerryland, an hour south of St John’s, Newfoundland, made headlines in 2017 thanks to a rather unique neighbour, in the form of a giant iceberg. The town is located right on a part of Canada’s east coast known as Iceberg Alley, so-called because hundreds of icebergs that break off in the Arctic float down past the Newfoundland and Labrador from spring to September. And while the behemoth that took up residence on Ferryland’s doorstep was a particularly large example, you can spot these 10,000-year-old glacial giants from many viewing points along the northern and eastern coasts of this province, by boat tour or kayak. You can even track them online.Walk on the ocean floor in the Bay of FundyPerfect for: intrepid explorersFancy going for a walk? How about a stroll along the actual ocean floor? It may sound out-of-this-world, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible – because in the Bay of Fundy, which lies between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, you can do just that. It’s all thanks to the unusual variance between low and high tide in the bay, which can exceed 15 metres. At low tide, the ocean floor at the head of the bay is exposed for around three hours, with towering cliffs and sea stacks creating a surreal backdrop to seafloor exploration – which often yields the discovery of fossils, sea glass, and semi-precious stones. Then visit a few hours later to see how fast the water returns.Fly WestJet from London to Canada’s capital cities and have your own Canadian adventure"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbe692aacaa6cff92b06975d8f44d560be532d79/0_172_5733_3442/master/5733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d481d47ee6dcfdee6a003a012274eb","title":"great for the grid canadas most instagrammable views","story":"Whether it’s Québec City’s gorgeous Rue du Cul-de-Sac, whale watching off the coast of British Columbia or taking in the vast northern expanse of Baffin Island, Canada is full of incomparable photo-opsNo matter if you’re armed with a DSLR or just a trusty iPhone, start planning your trip with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42d8a78f536e6d3a8047271114fce8278e6552d/19_0_6680_4010/master/6680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b36bbc6db7b5bed78c4a0fafa2c8cab","title":"canadas 10 coolest neighbourhoods in pictures","story":"Canada has a lot more to offer than just breathtaking natural scenery – and there is plenty of that – its thriving cities also happen to be home to some of the hippest, most dynamic neighbourhoods in North America.

Local authorities would carry out regular “health checks” instead, while inspectors would be called in for more in-depth visits. What do teachers and parents think? Should Ofsted be abolished?maths teacher, the Beacon school, Banstead, SurreyYes. Ofsted creates an environment of fear, anxiety and worry for teachers. To prepare for an Ofsted visit, you may have to do a lot of tick-box exercises, regimented things that don’t add value but help a school to look good. It inevitably adds to a teacher’s workload.Plus the current system is so punitive. There’s no supportive element to it. An external body comes in and passes judgment on a school. A bad judgment can feel like a prison sentence, involving years of seriously irrelevant work and pressure from headteachers. That has a negative effect on classroom teachers and, inevitably, students.Schools should be held accountable but they should be supported as well as evaluated, ideally by other school leaders with local expertise, as part of a continuous improvement process. Context matters and, unlike Ofsted inspectors, local teachers will understand the school’s demographic and its history over the years.Schools should be told: these are your strengths, these are your weaknesses and these are some brilliant schools in your geographical area, we’re going to support you to work together collaboratively.I would not shy away from someone coming in regularly to tell me how I can improve. I’m a professional, I want to do my job better. But I want someone who’s going to put an arm around me and walk on that journey with me, someone who will support me, not just tell me all the things I’m not doing right.consultant and former headteacher, who resigned on TV in the BBC documentary SchoolNo, because accountability is important – and we could spend a lot of unnecessary time restructuring the accountability system in line with what Labour is saying. However, there is too much human interpretation in the inspection framework and I don’t think it should continue in its current format. What needs to change is Ofsted’s job, so inspectors are no longer trying to root out under-performance, inadequacy and failure.Ofsted needs to be a lot more realistic about what it can accurately, effectively and specifically hold schools accountable for. I don’t think it’s feasible or possible to inspect everything a school does accurately, and then reduce it down to a one-word judgment.So I agree with Labour: we should either remove the judgment categories or stop trying to summarise the work that schools do with one word that is then used as a stick to beat schools with.We’d be better off if Ofsted judged schools annually on outcomes it is accurately able to quantify. The focus of the inspections, however, should be detached from the dataset and identify where practice is good and needs to improve. The inspection would then take on a completely different flavour, and use a broad body of research, evidence and training to support schools and help them improve.Yes. I chose to send my child to a school that had just been told by Ofsted it “requires improvement”. Although I thought the judgment was absolutely right, I saw at close-hand the effect it had. The school lost a lot of pupils, it lost money and had to get rid of experienced staff, which meant it was harder for it to improve.In other countries you don’t have this totally punitive system. Teachers don’t need to be whipped into doing their jobs better. I think teachers genuinely want to provide the best quality education. It’s crucial to have inspections, but one- or two-day inspections are too short – you can’t get under the skin of the school. Nor can you accurately sum up a school with a one-word judgment. We need a way of assessing schools that results in a much more positive relationship and takes into account the wellbeing of students and staff and how inclusive the school is. At the moment, some schools discourage admission of children with additional needs because it affects their results.Support for school improvement has to be at a local level and come from experts who know the particular challenges of the schools in their area. I agree it would be good to have the option of more formal and less formal inspections by inspectors who are independent of the local authority – but those inspectors should have a constructive mindset. I’d like to see a network of successful former headteachers visiting schools regularly and providing ideas and connections. We need, as Angela Rayner says, a much more collaborative model of education, rather than pitting schools against each other.Yes, but only if something better can replace it. I’m not sure whether Ofsted can be successfully overhauled, and every educational institution has to be accountable for its standards. I also think the safeguarding of children should be checked every year.What Ofsted does at the moment isn’t necessarily bad practice but it’s not contextualised. I’d like to see local audits every year by a former teacher or teaching specialist who understands the local area. They should take into account whether the school is surrounded by grammar schools or in an area of huge social deprivation, and consider whether the local authority is effective and if the level of funding is appropriate for that school.I’d love to get rid of judgments, as Labour proposes. At the moment, the process doesn’t feel very human. A one-word judgment is too simplistic, because even schools in special measures have fantastic stuff going on.But I’d worry about Labour’s proposal to give more control to local authorities. If you’ve got a really strong local authority, that’s fine. But in some areas, schools can be left to rot.I’d like to see schools have more of a say in who comes to see them. There are some absolutely cracking inspectors out there and I wouldn’t want to stop them doing their job. When they turn up and support you, and provide really useful feedback, it’s magic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7680b312250f1e788f8834b1c78ab644c3b4ca95/0_329_5804_3482/master/5804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3125860b7c6c0037c81140654788f6","title":"oxford professors children refused visas to join her in uk","story":"US family split as Home Office makes it increasingly difficult for overseas academics to work in UK universitiesAmber Murrey, an American academic, was “ecstatic” about being appointed associate professor in geography at Oxford University last year. But the dream turned sour two weeks ago when the Home Office refused to grant visas for her two daughters, aged four and nine, to live with her in the UK.Dr Murrey used an immigration lawyer to make sure the visa applications for her daughters, who have US passports, went smoothly, and was not anticipating a problem. Her husband has business commitments overseeing property renovations in Cameroon, where he is from, and the couple had included joint written consent for their daughters to live with her in Oxford.“When I read those three unemotional sentences saying they were denying my children entry to the UK I felt complete disbelief,” she says. “I had already packed the girls’ bags and bought their school uniforms. It is insane that you can have a legal document with both parents’ consent to have the children with their mother and they simply say no, that can’t happen.”Her case will add to a tide of anger among academics, who say the Home Office’s hostile immigration environment is making it difficult for talented people from abroad to forge an academic career in the UK.This is the second time in a month that the Home Office has refused a visa to an American academic based at Oxford University. Last month Education  reported that Dr Elizabeth Ford, a music historian about to start a fellowship at Oxford, was given two weeks to leave after eight years in the UK, because the Home Office said it had granted her last visa erroneously.Young overseas academics say that universities are now so frightened of the tough new visa regime that, in some cases, they are automatically rejecting international candidates for jobs they should be eligible for.Dr Murrey, an expert on social change in Africa, who has published widely and previously held positions at universities in Cairo, Massachusetts and Ethiopia, took up her post in Oxford last year. Without proof of residency she couldn’t set up schooling or somewhere to live in advance, so the couple decided she should establish a base in Oxford before moving the family. While she has been returning to Cameroon to see her daughters and husband in the university holidays, she says this has been an emotional strain.“It has been really hard, because I need to spend more time with my daughters but I am wary of being out of the UK for too long in case it jeopardises the terms of my tier 2 visa,” she says.The news has hit the family hard. Murrey says: “My nine-year-old had been so excited about her new school, and our apartment near a meadow. After I told her their visas had been denied she told me: ‘I know why they rejected me, it’s because I’ve been misbehaving this week, Mama’. We both cried very hard.”The Home Office rejection letters say that under immigration rules a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living together in the UK. This would be waived if the parent living here had sole responsibility for the children, or the other partner had died.“This policy seems to operate under the guise of keeping families together, but it is splitting mine apart,” Murrey says.Ultimately the couple want the whole family to live together in Oxford, but Murrey says that right now they are just trying to “do what is best for our daughters”.She doesn’t know whether she has been singled out as a risk because her husband is from Cameroon. “We have family members and friends there who have been rejected for British visas in the past,” she says.The Wellcome Trust, a health research charity, has evidence of around 100 cases in which academics, especially from African countries, have been refused visas to come to the UK for conferences, often for spurious reasons.The African Studies Association UK found that at least 17 delegates were refused entry for its biennial academic conference at Birmingham University last year.Insa Nolte, a lecturer in African culture at Birmingham, is frustrated that academics can’t appeal against these decisions. “There is no process to identify immigration officers who consistently misjudge cases or who make racist assumptions,” she says.“If we are going to find solutions to global concerns like food security and climate change, we need to collaborate with academics across the world.”Meanwhile, young international academics who have gained their PhDs in Britain say some universities, fearful of the tougher visa rules, are automatically rejecting non-UK nationals for jobs for which they should be eligible.Dr Lisa Kalayji, an American who did her PhD in sociology at Edinburgh University, says: “In one case it was a job at another university I knew I could get a visa for. There was a pop-up as soon as I clicked the box saying I would need a visa. It said: ‘It is extremely unlikely that we would be able to sponsor you and we recommend that you abandon the application now’.” She applied anyway, but at 1am the next day received a rejection email. “It was clear that was an automated response, presumably because I was not a UK national.” Kalayji has given up applying to British universities. “Living with the hostile environment in the UK has worn me down so much that I don’t want to be an immigrant any more. The emotional tax is too great. I’m going home.”A young Canadian academic, who wished to remain anonymous, recently encountered a similar pop-up window when applying for a full-time lectureship that should have qualified her for a tier 2 visa at a London university.“It said: ‘It is highly unlikely that you would obtain permission to work in the UK on the basis of an offer for this … job. It is therefore recommended that you do not continue with your application’.”She says this felt like a sign saying: “foreigners go home”. She blames the government rather than universities, but says that after a year of applying for jobs she is beginning to feel desperate.Gareth Edwards, a senior geography lecturer at the University of East Anglia and co-founder of International and Broke, which campaigns against high visa costs for academics, says international academics are getting this sort of pop-up warning when applying for permanent lectureships. “Those jobs are most certainly eligible for sponsorship,” he says.Melany Cruz, a Chilean PhD student at Birmingham University, applied for an academic position elsewhere and also got an apparently automated rejection at 1am the next working day. “I’m sure not many HR people are working at 1am. I don’t think my application ever made it to the panel,” she says. “It is starting to feel impossible to find a job as an international PhD student, which is such a shame as I love what I do.”Paul Boustead, chair of the HR practitioners’ group Universities Human Resources, says universities want to recruit the most talented staff but some roles are simply “unlikely to obtain a work permit”.The Home Office says:“We welcome international academics from across the globe and recognise their contribution to the UK’s world-leading education sector. All UK visa applications are considered on their inidual merits, on the basis of the evidence available, and in line with the immigration rules.”This story was amended on 1 October 2019 to correct the spelling of Lisa Kalayji’s name.

We need to change thatThe playwright Shelagh Delaney shot to fame when her debut work, A Taste of Honey, first performed in 1958, turned into a runaway success. She was just 19.The play told the story of a single mother, Helen, and her teenage daughter, Jo, who wanted more from life than marriage and motherhood in the slums. It has rarely been off the stage since and is currently being revived in a National Theatre tour.Fascinated by the work and its Salford-born creator, I set about writing a biography of Delaney. And the question I’ve asked myself most is: where will the next Shelagh Delaney come from?I’ve found it hard to answer. Not because young women today lack Delaney’s ambition or imagination – I’ve met plenty with both at Manchester’s MaD Theatre Company and Salford Arts Theatre. But they voice frustration that creative subjects are in decline in our schools. Fewer students now take English A-levels. The Ebacc, introduced by Michael Gove to promote certain favoured subjects, deters creative studies. The arts are the poor relation of “real” education – defined by government since 2010 as memorising quotations, formulae and dates. Students who struggle are encouraged to focus on vocational skills most prominently in the new T-levels. Neither route develops imagination and initiative.That is a particularly urgent problem now. The challenges of automation, climate change and, yes, life beyond Brexit, require innovation and critical thinking. We’ll need everyone to play a part if we are to save the world – and arts education is crucial.Delaney’s life shows that artistic education benefits everyone. In 1949 she failed the 11-plus, which, like every other intelligence test, assessed social class rather than brainpower. Fortunately, a visionary teacher at her secondary modern school recognised that her pupils deserved to experience the arts. When she invited Delaney to a school performance of Othello, it made a great impression.But even inspiring teachers cannot overcome a limited curriculum and underfunding. For this reason, Delaney’s teachers pushed for her transfer to a grammar school – but when she got there she discovered that an “academic” education meant rote learning.She left for a series of factory and shop jobs. She owed her big break to her maverick teacher, and to Labour’s postwar investment in the arts and libraries – she was encouraged to write by the council-funded Manchester Library Theatre.Since 1958, generations of theatregoers, teachers and students have been inspired by Delaney’s debut play. Their enthusiasm refutes Tory politicians’ narrow definition of “great” literature. In the 1960s, one teacher, Eva Fulleylove, who taught ex-secondary modern teenagers at a technical college, said acting in A Taste of Honey helped them overcome their “sense of academic inferiority and feeling of unimportance.” Exam grades don’t do justice to such responses.But, as many teachers have long understood, art doesn’t only resonate with us if it mirrors our lives. Fulleylove’s students studied Honey alongside The Diary of Anne Frank and the works of Shakespeare – set texts in comprehensives between the 1970s and the 2010s. Delaney would have approved. “The working classes in the gallery have supported the British theatre ever since Elizabethan times,” she said. “Give them good plays and they will go to the theatre.”The arts encourage us to believe we can change the world for the better - perhaps too worrying for a rightwing government. They help us to understand those different from us, and to identify common ground. They dare us to dream of a different future.Delaney was adamant that she was “not a native genius”. Imagine, she suggested, how enriched Britain would be if everyone had her luck. That lesson still applies today. Whether treated as a “soft” subject or the preserve of an elite, the arts are not where they should be in our education system: centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7fa8affe27ac98750d34d5b062076a5f38ba236/0_0_4182_2510/master/4182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9c705ede080d509d912af130bf538c","title":"pine martens released secret location forest of dean gloucestershire","story":"Reintroduction of species into Gloucestershire could prove setback for grey squirrels The shy and elusive pine marten, a woodland creature almost hunted to extinction in the UK, has been reintroduced to a forest in the English west country.Eighteen of the animals have been released at a secret and remote location in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire.Conservationists hope the animals will breed, spread and eventually link up with a group of pine martens that was reintroduced across the border in Wales.It is possible the reintroduction will help manage the number of non-native grey squirrels in the forest and anywhere else the pine martens reach.Pine martens, which belong to the same family as otters and weasels, were once common in the UK. They are similar in size to a domestic cat with slim bodies, brown fur, a distinctive cream bib on their throats, long, bushy tails and prominent rounded ears.Extensive hunting, together with the loss of their woodland home, have led to them being pushed out to more remote parts of the UK. Their only remaining stronghold is in the Highlands of Scotland.There are believed to be about only 20 pine martens left in England. Between 2015 and 2017, more than 50 Scottish pine martens were captured and transported to Wales, where there is now an established population.In August and September this year, 18 pine martens were trapped near Inverness and taken to Gloucestershire. They were fitted with tracking collars and released into the Forest of Dean.Gareth Parry, the director of conservation at Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, said the pine martens’ activity will be closely monitored. He predicted a setback for the local grey squirrels, who tend to produce fewer young when there is a potential predator in the area. A reduction in the number of grey squirrels could help preserve ancient woodland, which they damage.The pine martens are likely to co-exist happily with the wild boar, a Forest of Dean inhabitant, which has made a comeback in the area.Parry added: “We are in a bioersity emergency and conserving our remaining wildlife is not enough. We must also take action to support nature’s recovery.”Catherine McNicol, the trust’s conservation project manager, said people were unlikely to see pine martens soon. “Pine martens are elusive and shy animals, with their presence often only indicated by scats in the middle of forestry tracks,” she said. “They only give birth to a few kits each year if breeding is even successful, so the rate of marten population recovery in the UK is low.”Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust is working with several organisations on the project including Forestry England, the Vincent Wildlife Trust and Forest Research.Rebecca Wilson, Forestry England’s planning and environment manager in west England, said: “As native omnivores, pine martens play a vital role in the delicate balance of woodland ecosystems"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/447d1b5b661627f0c5973c496895a7598d57f442/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36a00b315050378f610837722be94f30","title":"alexander skarsgard i spend hours thinking what kind of shoes would this guy wear","story":"The actor talks about 90s style, itchy jumpers and how he pays much more attention to his characters’ outfits than his ownThis is a suit I wore while filming On Becoming a God in Central Florida.

We had a lot of fun putting together some ostentatious and quite tacky outfits, culminating in a very ill-fitting tuxedo.Going to costume fittings is always instrumental, for me, in finding the character. I spend hours thinking: “What kind of shoe would this guy wear? What kind of jacket?” It’s always a collaboration between me and the costume designer and I will agonise over an outfit – if I find a great pair of shoes, but they are slightly the wrong colour, that can bother me a lot.In my personal life, I don’t pay much attention to what I wear – it’s the other end of the spectrum and I like to just switch off. I don’t have the energy to spend more than two minutes thinking about it in the morning and so I pretty much wear the same thing every day. That is not to say I’m not interested in clothes – it can be fun to dress up for an event – but that’s a special occasion. I never “put together an outfit” if I’m just running around New York or Stockholm. I have always been allergic to clothes that are not comfortable – as much as I love the look of a wool sweater, I can’t wear them because they’re too itchy. I gravitate towards soft fabrics.Alexander Skarsgård is the face of the new global campaign from Clarks shoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40fc4ac6d4f1b492f1210fcad1f90295b2761f72/0_1486_4968_2979/master/4968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9f0d07f230ca9d308bc0353c744f14","title":"nigel slater hake with pea salsa recipe","story":"Fried fish with a delicious and piquant herb-rich pea puréePut a medium-sized pan of water on to boil.

It is, if nothing else, in keeping with the nature of the club’s FC Hollywood moniker. From the sublime – look no further than Philippe Coutinho’s sumptuous assist for Serge Gnabry on Saturday – to the ridiculous, namely the president, Uli Hoeness, recently backtracking over threatening to prevent players joining up with the national side should Manuel Neuer be dropped in favour of Marc-André ter Stegen. Never dull, it has been difficult for Bayern to mute the volume on a series of sagas.There was the very public summer pursuit of Leroy Sané, with Bayern expected to make another play for the Manchester City winger in January, and a failed effort to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea. The man behind the moves is the sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, who is out of contract next summer and at pains to convince despite pulling rabbits out of the hat with the last-minute loan signings of Coutinho and Ivan Perisic.In addition there is a changing of the guard at the top. Hoeness and the chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, have announced they will depart, though neither will truly surrender power any time soon Hoeness will step down in November but remain on the club’s supervisory board until at least 2023 while the former Bayern captain Oliver Kahn will assume Rummenigge’s role on the first day of 2022. Caught in the middle of the impasse and infighting is the manager Niko Kovac, walking a tightrope to keep both satisfied Rummenigge has aired his doubts and ticked off Kovac after the Croat said he was confident Sané would join the club.It seems absurd that the ground is so rocky at Bayern before they face Tottenham on Tuesday, given they are top of the Bundesliga – in which they have not lost since February – after winning a domestic double. But this is Bayern, a team who do not know any different. They are a club obsessed with success, an empire with their eyes fixed on something significantly more substantial than pipping Borussia Dortmund to the next title. Domestic success is a given by Bayern’s standards and an insipid Champions League exit to Liverpool in March – the last time they were defeated in Bavaria – rankled from top to bottom.This season they will again be expected to go deep into the competition. Bayern yearn to restore their status as a European superpower, to be elevated to the heights that Jupp Heynckes lifted them when they won the Champions League, the final of which Bayern will host in 2022, in a treble-winning season six years ago.The one constant since July 2014 has been the prolific Robert Lewandowski, who has scored 12 goals in 11 matches this season. Ten of those came in the Bundesliga, meaning he has personally outscored 10 of the 18 teams in the ision. Since joining Bayern from Dortmund the Pole has scored 138 league goals in 165 games. Before the arrivals of Coutinho and Perisic, which earned Salihamidzic much-needed brownie points, the 31-year-old openly questioned the club’s transfer activity. “We need players who can make an immediate difference from the bench,” Lewandowski said after defeat by Dortmund in the German Supercup during August. He signed a new four-year contract 26 days later. “Yes, I stated my opinion,” he said. “I can win games on my own but only teams win titles.”Everything may not be rosy – it hardly ever is at Bayern – but there is plenty for Spurs to fear. Perisic and Lucas Hernández are fit enough to be part of Kovac’s travelling squad while Gnabry and Kingsley Coman continue to flourish where Arjen Robben and Franck Ribéry for so long excelled. The 18-year-old Alphonso Davies, who was born in a refugee camp in Ghana after his parents fled the second Liberian civil war, has provided further verve.Coutinho has been starting at the expense of a fans’ favourite, Thomas Müller, who has been relegated to the bench. “He has dealt with the situation really well,” Salihamidzic said. “He is total professional.” Yet the element of struggle in a 3-2 victory over the ision’s bottom club last weekend is symptomatic of the uphill task facing Kovac, hampered by unhelpful headlines since taking the job last year.As Kicker pointed out, Bayern were made to worry. “That was not the manner of victory we wanted,” Salihamidzic said of a wasteful display. “In footballing terms we can play much better, clearly. We want to, we will and we must increase the level of performance. If in London we are presented with two big chances, then we must be more effective.”The challenge now, as Der Spiegel highlighted, is for Coutinho to weave his magic in a Bayern shirt against not only a team playing in the Bundesliga 2 last season but also last season’s Champions League finalists. Mats Hummels and Rafinha, players Kovac failed to convince, departed this summer but when Hoeness eventually follows there is an expectation that the manager will be exposed to greater scrutiny by Rummenigge. Hoeness has suggested a little friction fosters success but any fallout could get messy. Kovac knows, as Mauricio Pochettino can vouch, he is never too far from apparent crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8161c1edd98a5339edbcde639b5967430c537553/0_249_5042_3025/master/5042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e74f873cd00a54b72aef31076449f29","title":"manchester united arsenal felt like mid table game","story":"Everywhere you turned, there were the memories. In the tunnel, there was Roy Keane telling Patrick Vieira he’d see him out there. By the touchline there was Gary Neville kicking José Antonio Reyes. Just outside the penalty area, there was Martin Keown jostling Ruud van Nistelrooy. Remember? Remember how every man knew when we reached out to claim the throne? Remember when we were kings?Those pre-Abramovich days when this was the biggest game in English football seem a long time ago now, two decades gone with atrocious haste. Manchester United and Arsenal aren’t even the best sides in their respective cities any more and on nights like Monday it was impossible not to wonder how long it will take them to get back to where they were, whether they ever will get back.There are two great lies in football. The first, the short-term one, is transition. It’s an excuse made easier by the impatience of so much of football’s culture. Any manager can brush off a defeat or a run of poor form by saying his side is in transition. When the sack comes they can claim they just needed more time. Sometimes it is true. Among the most vivid of all the memories that haunt Old Trafford is the reaction to the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace in December 1989. The bedsheet bemoaning “three years of excuses” may be the most famous manifestation of the discontent but the fans en masse were in uproar.Six months later, United won the FA Cup and 23 years of success under Alex Ferguson had begun.It’s easy now to wonder what might have happened had the board not held its nerve, had Mark Robins not scored that winner at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup. If memories of that season and an instance when the transition was demonstrably in the right direction incline fans to caution now it is understandable. But often transition is just another word for stagnation.That season 30 years ago feels particularly relevant now. This is the fewest points United have had after seven games of a league season since then. Such judgments are subjective, but this feels the weakest squad United have had since then, certainly relative to the rest of the league. It’s not necessarily straightforward to tell in the moment but back then there was a clear plan as Ferguson refashioned and professionalised the squad. Can anybody, looking at this squad, at the recent transfers in and out, honestly say they can see a clear policy?Does anybody have any faith, even if fortunes are splurged, that things will be better in two transfer widows? In four? In six?Football’s other great lie is that success is cyclical, as though if you’re big enough things will come good if you wait long enough.Squads have cycles, it’s true, and whoever is in charge of long-term development, be that a manager or a sporting director, must manage the age profile of a team while fighting a constant war with entropy – but those are the details. There is also a macro picture and it’s that that must be of serious concern for United.Manchester United have made their worst start to a Premier League season after Monday night\u0027s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford.Pressure points: The pressure has built on Ole Gunnar Solskjær as United have taken only nine points from their first seven games – just enough for them to squeak in to the top half of the table. United have won only once since their opening 4-0 victory over Chelsea, with Marcus Rashford\u0027s penalty earning them a 1-0 home win against Leicester.\u0026nbspFall from grace:\u0026nbspIt is just two years since José Mourinho oversaw United\u0027s joint-best start to a Premier League season. United claimed 19 points from their first seven games in 2017-18, equalling the starts made by Sir Alex Ferguson\u0027s sides in 1999-2000 and 2011-12. United finished runners-up under Mourinho that season, but a whopping 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City.\u0026nbspOle at the wheel: The figures make bleak reading for Solskjær when comparing the Norwegian\u0027s record with his predecessors. Mourinho – who would be sacked in December – made a poor start last season, but his 10-point haul from the first seven games was still one more than Solskjær has managed 12 months on. David Moyes also took 10 points from his first seven games in the 2013-14 season, while Louis van Gaal won 11 and 16 points in the respective 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns.\u0026nbsp30-year low: The last time United made such a poor start to a campaign was under Ferguson in the days of the old First Division. United picked up only seven points from their first seven games of the 1989-90 season, a run that brought successive defeats to Derby, Norwich and Everton and ended with a famous 5-1 thrashing by Manchester City at Maine Road. United ended up 13th that season, but lifted the FA Cup as Ferguson won his first trophy in England. PA MediaAfter nine points from seven games this season, after 19 goals in their last 21 games, after an awkwardly imbalanced side lurched to another less-than-impressive result, the temptation is to start looking down rather than up. The gulf to City seems unbridgeable, at least in the short term, at least while Pep Guardiola remains in situ – and given how adroitly City’s present owners have planned everything so far, they’re as well placed to manage that transition as any side could be. The reports that Giovanni van Bronckhorst is already being groomed as his successor is indicative of a long-term perspective alien to the vast majority of clubs.The question now is rather how low United could go. The financial structure of modern football means there’s not going to be another relegation, as in 1974, and given how tightly bunched the league is, 10th isn’t necessarily as bad as it may appear. But United could easily finish behind Leicester City this season, and perhaps West Ham and Everton as well. There are no guarantees even of Europa League football.And that was what was most striking about Monday. It looked like a mid-table game and it felt like a mid-table game. Apart from everybody talking about how great it used to be, United v Arsenal felt like a nonevent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56502afc53ae9d56271f97335b44e0b1d4a3f249/1016_1025_956_573/master/956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a56648d311b1472da4e8873c0462d6db","title":"minecraft earth launch games microsoft augmented reality","story":"As the augmented-reality spinoff from the block-building game arrives this month, players will be taking their creations to the streetsSix of us are huddled together in Cavendish Square Gardens in central London, fighting a horde of warrior skeletons. To passersby, however, we must look like a bunch of adults pointing our smartphones at nothing while shouting about incoming monsters. This isn’t a bizarre new workplace therapy. What we’re doing is playing a beta version of Minecraft Earth, an augmented reality (AR) spinoff from the multimillion-selling block-building game – and very soon, parks all over the world will be filled with people just like us.This month, Minecraft is launching an early-access version of the game in a select few territories around the world, ahead of a global roll-out. Microsoft has yet to reveal exactly when and where, but soon thousands of fans used to playing on their console, PC or tablet, are going to be taking their creations to the streets.Built by a team at Microsoft’s Redmond campus, Minecraft Earth lets you construct models that can be viewed in real-world settings via your phone camera. You’ll be able to build a castle on your kitchen table, save it to memory, then view a lifesize version wherever you go – as long as there’s enough space for a virtual building made from 1m blocks, which can be up to 64 blocks high. The game also places collectible Minecraft blocks and objects – known as tappables – around your own neighbourhood, so while out walking, you can look at the map screen, see that there’s a treasure chest nearby, then tap on it to open it up and discover new resources to build with – perhaps a few planks of wood, some stone or a window.Like the gigantically successful Pokémon Go, however, there are also specific story events, tied to various locations, that players can discover and interact with. When Microsoft showed the game to a group of journalists in Cavendish Square Gardens, one of these Adventure tasks was marked on the Minecraft Earth maps on our phones – the moment we tapped on it, a lifesize stone building sprang up among the trees, and immediately skeleton soldiers began pouring out for us to attack with our swords and bows and arrows. When you defeat the onslaught, you get to scoop up all the treasure they leave behind. Although both the building and the skeletons are visible only as graphical objects on our phone screens, it’s weird how quickly and completely you get sucked in, forgetting that the joggers doing laps of the square can’t see the epic struggle taking place.The idea for Minecraft Earth came from an intriguing real-world project. In 2012, Mojang, the studio behind the Minecraft game, set up a charity named Block By Block, which allowed young people in developing countries to design new areas for their communities using the game. Working with the United Nations human settlements programme, these models and ideas could then be voted on and put into action, revitalising neglected or dangerous urban spaces.“We thought, what if everyone could try this?” says game director Torfi Olafsson. “We found out there was research going on in the Microsoft cognition group, which works on the Hololens unit, which would allow us to place things with precision in physical space – that’s the technology Adventures use.”Minecraft Earth employs Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing infrastructure to host and maintain the world, and Azure spatial anchors to place the persistent Adventure tasks in real-world locations. Each of these adventures is hosted on a single dedicated instance on the server, so everyone who sees an Adventure in a certain place can join in with other players and defeat enemies together. At the moment, the number of players able to join an instance is hard coded to a maximum of 40. “But it’s flexible,” says Olafsson. “It’s not a technical issue. It’s more about comfort and personal space.”The game also employs the collaborative mapping software OpenStreetMap to place tappables in the world, using a proprietary algorithm that selects suitable areas based on safety and space concerns. “Our algorithms will never choose an area that doesn’t grant enough space for you to manoeuvre within and around the adventure, and we’ll also allow players to feedback if they don’t think an adventure is well-placed,” says Olafsson. “OpenStreetMap is a fantastic resource, an incredibly detailed map of the entire world complete with tagging. You can see if a particular space is a cemetery, a public park or even a military installation.”Because the tags are generated by users, however, interesting errors can sometimes arise. “We had an issue with placing tappables in a particular neighbourhood of London,” says Olafsson. “We discovered that someone had tagged an upcoming extension of the underground as an overground train so our algorithm believed that there was a massive train line running through the area and excluded that neighbourhood completely.”He also says that some of the OpenStreetMap tags highlight locations that are unsafe – or just unsavoury. “It’ll give you information about areas that are not so nice, like really shady clubs. We use these tags to generate a blacklist of where not to place items, but it’s often very interesting – especially if you were building a sort of augmented reality Grand Theft Auto game!”Minecraft Earth has been in a prototyping phase for 18 months, and, over the last few weeks, a limited closed beta has taken place in key cities around the world – which has revealed some interesting issues. Players in Japan, for example, started to ride bullet trains so they could hoover up tappable objects much more quickly than just walking around their cities. “They were progressing too fast and it broke the system,” laughs Olafsson. “We had to install a speed limit on collecting in-game items.”The game was pirated during the beta and quickly distributed on Android devices. “Overnight we were seeing people in South Africa, in small villages in Siberia, all across Asia, a huge player base in South America,” says Olafsson. “It was shocking to wake up in the morning, look at the data and see that the game had accidentally gone global. We can’t condone piracy, but it definitely validated our use of OpenStreetMap data to generate content. A random person in Papua New Guinea was able to take their phone out and collect tappables because the algorithm had made content.”When the game enters open early access later this month, anyone in the supported territories (which Microsoft has not yet confirmed) will be able to download and play it while the team continues to iterate and improve the code. At the start, it’ll be possible to build and share only quite simple structures, although from the outset, you’ll be able to invite nearby players to collaborate on your projects. Later, Microsoft plans to define special areas in open public spaces where users will be able to showcase particularly impressive builds. Soon, perhaps, every park will have its own AR sculpture gallery.Considering the huge success of the Minecraft brand, which just reached 176 million players, as well as the continuing popularity of Pokémon Go, and the fascinated looks we drew from other people in Cavendish Square Gardens, Minecraft Earth is going to be extremely popular. It will be interesting to see how stable the experience is with hundreds of thousands of people playing, and whether the development team is able to evolve the game overtime to keep people involved. We have also yet to see exactly how Microsoft will monetise the game. It’s free to play, and to collect items, but there will be in-app purchases, perhaps providing quicker access to desirable rare blocks through payment options. Whatever the case, as a marker for the future of AR as a gaming platform, Minecraft Earth has fascinating ramifications."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f3d1a6aff9f49935ab8ee714a9ef8087257b9da/648_127_2253_1352/master/2253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a87ed93c0e19164dc562dd5cf322a5d","title":"geena davis damaging stereotypes on screen limit womens aspirations","story":"Actor speaks out as film industry study on characters in leadership roles finds women four times more likely than men to be shown nakedThe promises of positive change for women on screen that followed her role in the groundbreaking film Thelma and Louise have failed to materialise, leaving girls today with few role models, according to the actor Geena Davis.The media continue to have a huge influence on how the world views women and girls, and how they view themselves, she said. But few current roles show women in powerful positions, and continue to reinforce damaging gender stereotypes.“We know from many examples that media images can be incredibly powerful in a positive way if you bother to do that,” Davis told the . “My theory is we don’t have enough real-life role models of women in important positions and occupations to inspire change, and so we need to have them in fiction so that life will imitate art.“I believed all the press reaction about Thelma and Louise, that it was going to change everything and that there were now going to be far more female lead characters in movies, and I was thrilled.“And actually the next move I made, A League of Their Own, the press announced the same thing, that now absolutely for sure everything is going to change. There’ll be so many sports movies now. And none of those things happened.“It’s incredibly disappointing how little progress has been made.”Research published on Tuesday analysed the film industry’s portrayal of women and its impact on the lives of girls, carried out by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, which the actor founded in 2004, and the NGO Plan International.It analysed the 56 top-grossing films of 2018 in 20 countries in North America, Scandinavia, Africa, Asia, Latin America and Europe.Of the characters in leadership positions, it found that women and girls were four times more likely than men to be shown wearing revealing clothing nearly twice as likely to be shown as partially nude and four times more likely to be shown completely naked. It also found that when a slow motion focus was used on lead characters’ bodies, nearly twice as many female leads were sexually objectified than men.Research also revealed that twice as many men appeared in the 56 films and they spoke twice as much as women. Male characters were shown as being more effective and more respected when in leadership positions, while female presidents and prime ministers were portrayed as struggling with the job. Where female characters were portrayed as strong, it was in the home.Almost half of the characters across the films analysed, which collectively earned $21bn (£17bn) at the box office, were white. Only one of the 60 female leaders in the films was LGBTQ+. None of the films was directed by a woman, only a quarter had at least one female producer and one in 10 had at least one woman on the writing team.In the report, Rewrite her Story, 10,000 girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 25, in 19 countries, were polled about the role media played in shaping their aspirations and view of themselves.“Of course it hurts me because … even if I know I could be a leader, I won’t do it because I see it is just for men, not for women,” a 22-year-old Ugandan woman told researchers. “So that affects me. I’ll have to sit back and watch men doing it, even though I am capable of doing it too.”Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, CEO of Plan International, said while “a woman 007 or superhero in film is welcome … our research shows they are exceptions and not the rule”.“The bigger picture is that gender discrimination and harmful stereotypes still dominate on screen. This undermines girls and young women and has a negative impact on their aspirations to leadership in all walks of life.”Davis said she remained optimistic that things would improve. The #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have had a “remarkable” impact on the industry. “We can feel change in the air,” she said.“I feel the easiest way to bring change in our culture is on-screen representation. And if you make it happen there, it will happen in real life.”She added: “Imagine if I had stayed on air for eight years, what would be happening now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/317_133_3681_2209/master/3681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0fa67de279d55c13869e4722e5e1e3","title":"naga munchetty bbc reverses decision to censure presenter","story":"Director general Tony Hall emails staff to say he is overturning ruling over impartiality guidelinesThe BBC has reversed its decision to sanction BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty for breaking impartiality guidelines with her comments about Donald Trump, following a staff uprising against the ruling and enormous political pressure.Tony Hall, the BBC director general, emailed all staff on Monday to say he had reviewed the decision following internal and external protests. He said that, on reflection, the BBC’s complaints unit had made the wrong call when they ruled against Munchetty, one of the BBC’s most prominent minority ethnic journalists, for expressing a personal response to the US president’s statement in July that four American congresswomen of colour should “go home”.Asked about Trump’s comments on BBC Breakfast, Munchetty said: “Every time I have been told, as a woman of colour, to go back to where I came from, that was embedded in racism.”The U-turn over censuring her came after the  obtained leaked internal correspondence casting doubts on public claims about the complaints process made by a senior BBC executive, as he attempted to explain why Munchetty’s co-host Dan Walker had escaped punishment, despite taking part in the same discussion.The BBC’s editorial standards director, David Jordan, said Walker could not have been investigated because the single viewer complaint which led to the ruling did not mention the male presenter. “The simple fact is we haven’t had a complaint about Dan Walker’s role,” he said in one interview. “The complaint was about Naga Munchetty.”However, copies of the viewer’s complaint leaked to the  show that the original correspondence was explicitly about both Munchetty and Walker, leading to internal anger from BBC employees who demanded that women and minority ethnic journalists should be treated fairly by the corporation.The original complaint from a member of the public was titled “Blatant political bias from both presenters” and described Walker as “very unprofessional”, with the member of the public making clear that they blamed the male presenter for leading Munchetty into making the comments.The original complaint said: “Dan Walker, whilst interviewing a guest about President Trump’s recent tweets regarding 4 Democrat politicians in the USA, repeatedly expressed incredulity that anybody could defend Trump’s tweets. Very unprofessionally, he then asked his fellow presenter Naga Munchetty for her personal opinions on this news story! She foolishly complied with his request and launched into an attack on Trump, including stating that she was personally ‘furious’ about his comments. “These two presenters have never made any secret of their left-wing and anti-Trump bias but usually in more subtle ways, such as eye-rolling and looks of exasperation when reporting on news stories. However, personal commentary on controversial news stories is surely going too far and is way outside of their remit. They are employed as presenters not political commentators and as such should at least feign impartiality. It’s about time they were reminded of this.”The BBC insisted Jordan had not lied in the interviews when he said that Walker was not mentioned. They said Jordan was only referring to a revised version of the complaint, submitted by the same member of the public, which had been elevated to the corporation’s executive complaints unit. The BBC said this final version of the viewer complaint was solely about Munchetty, meaning it could not investigate Walker for his role in the discussion.On Monday night, BBC employees said the issue had reignited wider concerns about on-screen ersity at the corporation and how the BBC treated prominent senior white, male journalists differently to staff from a minority ethnic background.“People don’t care if it’s a conspiracy or not it just exposes the hypocrisy at the BBC,” said one senior journalist. “It’s come out by chance but it’s symptomatic of the arrogance of how BBC management treats women and people of colour. What’s really important is that Naga has said nothing and done nothing to encourage this, people have reacted spontaneously. This has got so big because journalists have just got together on their own and complained.”BBC journalists described growing concerns about the broadcaster’s role in an ongoing culture war which uses the BBC’s news coverage as a battleground for settling political scores, with particular concerns about a sometimes opaque complaints process that can be influenced by a single persistent member of the public.The U-turn followed several days in which the BBC management staunchly defended the original decision, insisting that although Munchetty was allowed to call Trump’s comments racist and offer a verdict on how they made her feel as a woman of colour, she could not cast aspersions on his character.The BBC had originally attempted to defend the decision, with Jordan saying it was not its role to be “calling out people for being liars or racist”.However, the corporation had come under intense political pressure to change direction, with the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, calling for it to be reconsidered and Labour MP Seema Malhotra organising a letter to Hall, signed by 100 MPs, calling for a meeting to discuss the decision.Hall’s email to BBC staff explained why he had changed direction: “I have looked carefully at all the arguments that have been made and assessed all of the materials. I have also examined the complaint itself,” he said. “It was only ever in a limited way that there was found to be a breach of our guidelines. These are often finely balanced and difficult judgments.“But, in this instance, I don’t think Naga’s words were sufficient to merit a partial uphold of the complaint around the comments she made. There was never any sanction against Naga and I hope this step makes that absolutely clear. She is an exceptional journalist and presenter and I am proud that she works for the BBC.“I have asked the editorial and leadership teams to discuss how we manage live exchanges on air around these topics in the future. Our impartiality is fundamental to our journalism and is what our audiences expect of us.”However, Hall fell short of apologising to Munchetty and did not address the issue of Jordan’s comments or why Walker had not be investigated for taking part in the discussion. On Friday, the BBC’s entire team of executives – including Hall - signed a public letter which backed the original decision, a position that has now been abandoned.The decision also raises major questions about the BBC’s ability to enforce its impartiality guidelines in the future, given the director general has now shown himself willing to intervene and overturn ruling by the semi-independent complaints unit in face of public pressure. The corporation’s management has been struggling to stop its journalists speaking out in a personal capacity on issues such as the Munchetty ruling and LGBT rights, with staff increasingly willing to ignore warnings from bosses to stay quiet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37014723d09e8ab06b0b6f5557a7f5cc99dec311/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=268de5bb972cca635f7c8a827fe2a75a","title":"50 great tracks october alicia keys dababy angel olsen","story":"An epic harp workout and an unearthed Japanese ambient gem sit alongside new rap from DaBaby and James Massiah in our playlist of the month’s best new music – read about our 10 favourites belowby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesThe video for this track is dubbed a “visual sonic installation” and stars the song’s duetting singers, plus Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego Saldana, and Michael B Jordan, all doing balletic things with water, paint and each other. It’s beautiful and rather grand, unlike the song, which is beautiful but much more understated. Over gently swaying acoustic guitar, Alicia and Miguel coo sweet nothings to each other in a gorgeous, timeless melody, the kind of thing that sounds improvised by Keys just sitting at the piano and playing. This relaxed, unforced mood hopefully suffuses her incoming seventh album. BBTIt’s hard to think of another contemporary singer who time-travels as convincingly as Angel Olsen. Her debut sounded as though it had been recorded by lamplight in a poorly insulated shack later records reinvigorated classic rock’n’roll and weepies worthy of Roy Orbison. On Lark, she harnesses high romanticism, the lux drama of classic Hollywood. It’s a hard sound to land without veering into pastiche, let alone to hold one’s own amid the heavy arrangements. But Olsen commands the scene. She teases out the details of a relationship that crumbled into the void of disconnection, the soft production accruing a potent charge. Then the tension snaps: “What about my dreams?” she howls, addressing a former lover who failed to see her for who she truly was. As the strings go off like a fireworks display comprised entirely of screamer rockets, the blinkered sod is left in no uncertain terms about the magnitude of her desires. LSThe rap breakthrough of the year award has to go to DaBaby, who has just released Kirk, his second album of 2019 following the excellent Baby on Baby. The first album was mostly fixated on guns, wealth and – as track titles such as Carpet Burn and Baby Sitter allude – shagging. But Intro announces that Kirk is rather more soul-searching. With his HD alpha-male delivery, DaBaby tells of his pre-fame poverty, and the pain of his father dying at the same time that he finally became successful. It prompts a reflection on the enduring power of family and friendship even through the complicating factors of newfound fame and wealth. BBTThis LA post-hardcore five-piece aren’t so much in touch with their feelings as sending them a constant stream of extremely earnest WhatsApps. A decade into their career, they follow their recently rerecorded debut with this first track from their forthcoming new album, and the lyrics from frontman Jeremy Bolm are almost self-parodic in their emo-ness: “A last responder to my own self interest … Cold-shouldered by design,” he laments. “I’m a secondhand piano  Incapable of tune  Providing the score  For gone too soon.” But boy, does he sell them – the chorus would be anthemic sung by anyone, but is made gloriously so by Bolm’s acute feeling. BBTIt’s tough to pick a standout from Brittany Howard’s remarkable debut solo album, Jaime. But even on this intimate, exposing record, Goat Head cuts deeper than everything else. It’s a break from the album’s diffuse blues, hooked instead around a lilting piano loop. Howard layers it as she assembles her child’s-eye understanding of colour: first learning red from green, the way your parents teach you. Then, starker differences: having a white mother and a black father in a southern town, and how that prompted a hate crime slashed tyres, a goat’s head on the back seat. The stumbling joins in the looped piano become fissures as the younger Howard becomes painfully cognisant of the world’s gaping inconsistencies more unsettling is how Howard and her backing vocalists turn “goat head in the back” into a sensual, soothing refrain. LSLeft over from the recording of her 2018 album Hundreds of Days, Quintana finds harpist Mary Lattimore at her most expansive and melancholy. Her glassy playing is subsumed by static fog, which, across 15 eventful minutes, swells and eddies, blurring the precision of her playing and building to an unexpected bass note that hits like a cataclysmic omen. The track also calls to mind the imposing tundras of Canadian drone composer Tim Hecker’s defining Ravedeath, 1972. Given that it’s an outtake from an album with which it has little in common, it’s hard to tell whether it indicates a new creative horizon or an abandoned idea for Lattimore. Either way, its bittersweet beauty and lingering sense of doom feels arrestingly contemporary for this moment in the climate crisis. LSAlthough he was recently and no doubt mendaciously mistaken for Beto O’Rourke by right-wing trolls, (Sandy) Alex G could never actually mount a credible Democratic candidacy campaign – he’s so horizontally chill you can barely imagine him mounting his stairs most days. But that demeanour has made the singer-songwriter – and Frank Ocean’s sometime guitarist – one of the best of his generation, with songs that rarely resolve in the way you expect them to. Southern Sky, from excellent new album House of Sugar, is the perfect entry point to his catalogue, with its Beach Boys-style naivety to the vocals and the playground-chant melody in the outro. BBTTexas-based French pop auteur Lou Rebecca trades in fantasy: she makes dreamy lounge pop that’s as featherlight as a pink macaron, her sexy-baby vocals in debt to countrywoman Brigitte Bardot. (It’s been a good year for it. See also: Swiss singer Vendredi sur Mer’s debut, Premiers Emois.) But the fantasy is all hers. On Desire, she beseeches a lover to get closer, tell her everything, says she’ll be anything they want. But her plan, it turns out, is more Villanelle than Valentine: “Je plante mes crocs dans ta chair,” she coos – I’ll sink my fangs into your flesh – taking revenge against men who treat women like wish-fulfilment machines. They should have seen it coming: the insouciant yet relentless disco beat speaks to a strategic mind hard at work behind the deceptively sugary facade. LSSet in an equatorial city, the gripping video for south London poetrapper James Massiah’s debut single depicts people struggling to go about their everyday business in apocalyptic heat – so hot that an egg frying on the pavement becomes an omen for their fate. The track is as cool as the clip is sweltering: Massiah connects the threads from eski to dancehall and the slower end of acid house, unspooling a nonchalant devotional amid a cocky bassline and glacial, ravey synths that sparkle enticingly. LSJapanese ambient is the latest frontier in reissue culture: following the Kankyō Ongaku compilation earlier this year, and albums by Yutaka Hirose, Midori Takada, Takashi Kukobo and Hiroshi Yoshimura all recently returning to circulation, next up is Toshifumi Hinata, whose best bits have been collected as the album Broken Belief this month by the Music from Memory label. There are big synth-y fantasias, drifting chordscapes and pristine piano notes, but the best moments are the more fleshed-out rhythm tracks. Atarashii Yuhbokumin has a bossa nova energy to its drum machine pulse, creating a sensual space for its affecting central piano melody and jazzy bass solo.

The company was founded and run by Boris Johnson’s friend Jennifer Arcuri after she had moved back to the US.Speaking to the , she said: “It is a complete mystery to me how this company got anywhere near the money.”The DCMS has launched a review into how the grant was made and withheld £53,000 that is yet to be transferred to Hacker House.James, who resigned as a minister a week before Johnson became prime minister, said: “I’m totally appalled that the money was awarded to this company. Although it didn’t get my sign-off I was the minister responsible at the time, so that’s why I want to know now, belatedly, what happened.”Matt Warman, a DCMS undersecretary, insisted last week that the department had done the “usual due diligence” over Hacker House before awarding the money.“This is a company that is based in Britain as far as Companies House is concerned. It is a company with a British phone number,” he told the Commons. But when the  phoned the UK number it got through to the US and when a reporter visited its UK-registered address he was told it was a “virtual office” and staff were based elsewhere.James, who is one of 21 Tory MPs to have had the whip removed after rebelling on Brexit, said doubts about the company’s links to the UK were “obvious a mile off”. She added: “Anyone can register at Companies House and provide a British number.”She pointed out that the grant was designed to foster UK skills and was eligible only for genuinely UK-based companies. “We need the digital skills gap to be closed in the UK, not the bloody US,” she said.Asked if she thought officials had been hoodwinked, she said: “I think that is the kindest explanation. I didn’t insist on ministerial oversight of the various applications. Perhaps I should have done with the benefit of hindsight. I would have look at the revenues and thought what’s going on here. We don’t want startups, we need companies with a proven track record.”James also called for a “full and frank” review into what went wrong and for the department to avoid a government tendency to “close ranks”. She said: “I don’t think anyone has got any chance of sweeping it under the carpet. It is too out in the open now.”Separately, it has emerged that when Arcuri first launched a website for Hacker House in 2015, it included a promotional video featuring Johnson endorsing her previous company, Innotech, and referring to Arcuri by her first name.In the video, Johnson says: “Viva Innotech folks, and forward with all your deliberations. Will that do, Jennifer? Can I go now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Everyone is entitled to have a view – be they parliamentarian, journalist or a member of the public – and their right to safety cannot in any way be dependent on what that view is or the course of political action they take.”The gathering was instigated following anger and upset in the Commons last week, when there was repeated criticism of Boris Johnson for terms such as “surrender bill” to describe a backbench-instigated law seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit.The most vehement anger came on Wednesday last week, when Johnson described as “humbug” worries expressed by Labour’s Paula Sherriff about threats to MPs by people using the same language as the prime minister, and her fears of a repeat of the 2016 murder of fellow Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right terrorist.Johnson was also condemned for arguing in the same debate that the best way to honour Cox – who campaigned vigorously for remain – would be to “get Brexit done”.The prime minister repeatedly refused to apologise, saying only that his use of “humbug” referred to people arguing against the use of the term surrender, and that he was “sorry for the misunderstanding”.Speaking after the meeting, Corbyn said he had requested the gathering following Johnson’s comments “and the appalling language he used, particularly in respect of Paula Sheriff’s comments over the death of Jo Cox”.Corbyn said: “The Speaker has since drafted up a statement on behalf of us, which is to say: tone down the rhetoric, tone down the language.“‘Yes, political debate. Yes, political disagreement. Yes, passionate political thought but don’t use hyperbolic language that’s dangerous. Don’t use language that incites people to act in a dangerous way on the streets of our country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2d6f28dd40ae008b3af87e0af6aee23aca911f/0_316_4913_2948/master/4913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad26062a1c048771d6d745e298eedf4f","title":"athletics coach alberto salazar receives four year ban for doping violations","story":"Alberto Salazar, the legendary American distance coach who guided Mo Farah to six world titles and four Olympic gold medals, has been sent home from the world championships in Doha following his four-year ban for doping violations. The US Anti-Doping Agency found that Salazar had been “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, a group that was initially set up to help US endurance athletes beat the best runners from Africa but later recruited Farah and others from around the world.Farah, who trained with Salazar from 2010 until 2017, admitted he was happy the investigation had finally concluded. “I’m relieved that Usada has, after four years, completed their investigation into Alberto Salazar,” he said in a statement. “I left the Nike Oregon Project in 2017 but as I’ve always said, I have no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules or crosses a line. A ruling has been made and I’m glad there has finally been a conclusion.”Salazar was found by an arbitration panel to have trafficked testosterone – a banned performance-enhancing substance – to multiple athletes, administered a prohibited IV infusion, and also tampered or attempted to tamper with Nike Oregon Project athletes’ doping control process.Jeffrey Brown, who worked as a paid consultant endocrinologist for Nike on performance enhancement and served as a physician for many of Salazar’s athletes, also received a four-year ban. In a statement, Travis Tygart, the CEO of US Anti-Doping, praised the numerous whistleblowers who had come forward and condemned Salazar and Brown’s behaviour.“The athletes in these cases found the courage to speak out and ultimately exposed the truth,” he added. “While acting in connection with the Nike Oregon Project, Mr Salazar and Dr Brown demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect.”The IAAF, athletics’ governing body, later confirmed that it had “deactivated” his accreditation. But the 61-year-old Salazar who watched one of his athletes, Sifan Hassan, win the 10,000m gold earlier this week, said he was “shocked” by the outcome and would appeal against it. “The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,” he said. “I will appeal and look forward to this unfair and protracted process reaching the conclusion I know to be true.”“Throughout this six-year investigation my athletes and I have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from Usada,” he added. “This is demonstrated by the misleading statement released by Travis Tygart stating that we put winning ahead of athlete safety. This is completely false and contrary to the findings of the arbitrators, who even wrote about the care I took in complying with the world anti-doping code.”Farah was with Salazar for nearly seven years during which time he went from being just outside elite level to virtually unbeatable. He stuck with his famed coach after allegations against Salazar first surfaced in a BBC and ProPublica report in 2015 and only left in 2017. At the time, Farah denied his decision was connected to the doping claims. Usada first brought doping charges against Salazar and Brown in June 2017 in a court battle that was heard behind closed doors.One of the BBC and Propublica’s key whistleblowers, Steve Magness, who worked as Salazar’s assistant, tweeted after Usada’s statement: “Tell the truth. Own your mistakes. Choose the difficult path. In the short term, it might feel horrible, but over the long haul it’s the only path to take. Speak up, stay true to your convictions. None of us are perfect. But we can all aspire to be better.”Nick Willis, a two-time Olympic medalist over 1500m, also said he was delighted at the news. “Justice. I’m tired of having to hide my thoughts. The charade is finally over. Our sport will be much better off with Alberto gone.”Meanwhile, Nike said that it would back Salazar’s appeal and that Usada’s decision had “nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete”.“As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the world anti-doping code. We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require. Nike does not condone the use of banned substances in any manner.”In a statement UK Athletics defended its decision to stick with Salazar after revelations against him first surfaced in 2015. “It should be noted that at all times UK Athletics fully cooperated with both Usada and Ukad throughout the investigations,” it added. “Furthermore the performance oversight committee’s own investigation in 2015 was restricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah. and not an anti-doping investigation. Such investigations can and should only be undertaken by the relevant anti-doping authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fbf750eaf8d610f64549c83e02f783879a9cad6/104_52_2670_1601/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9594bf8a613aef5feb6ca569a1cf07a1","title":"england are boring says argentina hooker rugby world cup","story":"Agustin Creevy has described England as boring and claimed that the World Cup match on Saturday will be “like a war”. The hooker, who has captained Argentina 49 times, spent two seasons in the Premiership with Worcester and also believes that gives him inside knowledge on the Pumas’ opponents this weekend.“Maybe my play in Worcester helped to see the way it will come on Saturday. They always play the same way in history. They are really structured and that for me is really good. I improved a lot.”Creevy relinquished the Argentina captaincy after four years in 2018 but he remains one of the most feared hookers in world rugby. He has faced England five times and lost on each occasion – the Pumas have not won in their past nine meetings since their 2009 victory – but he is relishing the challenge that awaits.“Saturday is going to be like a war, it’s like a final for us,” said Creevy, who arrived at Worcester in 2013. “I think the battle with the forwards will be the game. We need to win the scrum, win the lineout, win the maul, win the contact, the breakdown.“When we put on this shirt we feel something different. It’s our country, our family, my club. We play together, the group is really bonded. That is different to different teams. We love each other, and I think that is different to other teams. We are friends, we are brothers, inside and outside the field.”Argentina are traditionally known for a strong set-piece being the bedrock of their game. Their scrum was among the most disappointing aspects of a poor Rugby Championship this summer, but was vastly improved in their narrow defeat by France in their opening match.“We trained a lot. Our skills in the scrums and the mentality, we worked a lot in that,” Creevy said. “I think we are improving a lot in the scrum and we feel good, but we need to continue. The England scrum is really good.”Creevy is vying for selection in the No 2 jersey with Julian Montoya, who scored a hat-trick and was named man of the match in the victory against Tonga on Saturday. The 34-year-old is certain to be part of the matchday squad, however, and win his 88th international cap.“I’m really proud. I can’t explain with words, and in English it’s really difficult. I’m really proud to get 88 games with this shirt. I never imagined that, it’s a dream for me. I’m really happy. I think about my club, family, a lot of things I did and that was hard. Now I think about it and say it was really great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f4ddf676d732efbbf1f5cd969444284a5068a71/0_234_4378_2627/master/4378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0321e156f2170c27d1a932da5a4eec4","title":"rajasthan royals academy ipl cricket future","story":"Just a month to go, then, until the beginning of the end. Or the start of the beginning. Or something like that anyway. The last week in October will see English cricket’s inaugural draft, a first bolt of lightning shot through the Hundred’s shell-company teams. Unbidden, unprecedented, not to mention rootless and entirely commercial in nature the franchises are coming. Not that this is completely new. Look hard enough and they’re already here.Rewind to early August and down a winding lane, through a patch of woodland, in the middle of a new-build timber hanger a few miles off the A3, Jaydev Unadkat is trying to teach a nervous-looking 13-year-old left-arm seamer how to stop dragging his line down outside leg-stump by lifting his front arm a little higher.“The front arm is your radar,” Unadkat says, urging his charge to try it right now in front of 30 or so academy mates, plus assembled coaches, camera crew and the watching throng on the balcony.The nervous-looking seamer bites his lip, runs in, elevates his front arm and pings off stump out of its slot with a satisfying clank, just about concealing the flush of delighted relief as he strolls down to retrieve his ball.The coaches nod. Training ticks on. Unadkat, who has played Test cricket for India and was the most expensive Indian player at last year’s Indian Premier League auction, attends to some other pace bowling detail. And the only really puzzling thing about any of this is the fact everyone present is wearing the bright pink shirt of the Rajasthan Royals of Jaipur.The Royals have always positioned themselves as a hub for English IPL interests. From the start this most moneyball-ish of franchises has had a sprinkling of English players, from early Shane Warne-sourced adoptees Dimitri Mascherenas and Michael Lumb to the current A-list tier of Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer and Jos Buttler.The academy is something new. The following weekend these junior Royals will play Hampshire Under-15s at the Ageas Bowl, part of an ever-thickening round of county and touring fixtures. Even Unadkat is here on serious business, a training trip that will see him work with the bowling fitness guru and Royals consultant Steffan Jones.The part-owner Manoj Badale is agreeably open about all this. The goal of the Royals in England isn’t just to build the brand (as ever those outside English sport’s traditions speak with genuine pride about their sporting brands). It is to create a concrete cricketing presence, to foster the dream of a direct pathway from English grassroots to cricket’s most glam-laden stage.“Of course we’d love to see that happen,” Badale says. “We will also be happy if the academy continues to launch players in the county circuit, who then become England stars of the future.”Sounds fanciful? A few weeks after the Hampshire game Sid Lahiri, the mercurial head of the Royals’ UK academy, is still talking about a shot played by one hugely talented 13- year-old in Royals colours – a ramp-swept one-bounce four off an opening bowler – that seems to suggest the sky might indeed be the limit.“A hundred per cent it is the ultimate dream to go and play for Rajasthan Royals,” Lahiri says. “I am sure that will happen. The talent pool is there. If you look at the English kids we are coaching I would be surprised if we don’t see at least one of them in the Rajasthan Royals colours in a few years.”Lahiri is a fascinating figure in his own right. He came to England in 2003 to take his coaching badges at the end of some slightly frustrating travels around the domestic scene in India. “I knew nobody, had no clue, nobody knew who I was. I started with one boy. I had nothing. Just us at the park.”Eventually his time playing at Stoke D’Abernon, teaching cricket at Parkside school, and a generous cash gift from one very grateful and very wealthy parent – Lahiri bought four bowling machines with the money – led to the creation of Star Cricket Academy.At which point a bloom of young Surrey talent rolled in through the door. Lahiri coached Ollie Pope from the age of seven (“even then his ability to learn was mind-blowing”) as well as Ryan Patel, Amir Virdi and others. In 2019 his set-up at Reeds School was rolled up into Rajasthan Royals’ UK academy, a tie-in that has its roots in Lahiri’s long-standing relationship with Rubin Bharucha, now the Royals’ head of cricket.If there is still an air of double-take about all this, a sense of a punt, an entrepreneurial gamble, it is worth remembering the IPL is in itself a punt, albeit one that has from a standing start become the ninth most watched league in world sport. Why have the Rajasthan Royals opened an academy in England? For the same reason Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United have academies in every major sporting nation in the world, outriders of football’s steamrollering cultural ascent.But then English cricket has a history of missing the top line with India, Twenty20 and shifting tectonic plates. Like it or not the IPL is an expansionist force. It has to grow, has to stretch its tentacles. The franchise system offers this. A franchise, unlike a country, can be marketed and finessed as a brand, ranked on a scale of nought to Real Madrid or the Dallas Cowboys.There has already been talk of IPL franchises expanding via merger and acquisitions into the leagues of other countries. The Rajasthan Royals enter the Hundred: it won’t happen in any version of the future that doesn’t involve the cricketing public marching on ECB HQ brandishing pitchforks and lighted torches.For now the IPL will content itself with talk of fan parks, with an expansionist broadcast strategy (up significantly in the UK in the last two years) and with its seed planted in deepest Surrey.Something will grow here. It might be a tranche of fast-tracked English-born IPL players. Or simply a sense that the wild, aggressively entrepreneurial spirit of big sport, with all its collateral damage and brutal modernity, might just be the way to grow this cobwebbed old summer game in whatever direction it can find.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

A final undulating approach into Harrogate and two laps of the city circuit proved a war of attrition before Annemiek van Vleuten won the world champion titleYorkshire hosted the first ever team time trial mixed relay, with national teams consisting of three male and three female riders. The men set off first and the women replaced them on the road as soon as the second male rider crossed the finish line. Final timings were taken when the second female rider crossed the line.It was the first UCI-sanctioned international para-cycling event to take place alongside the UCI road world championships and was used as a qualifier for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.The route headed in a south-westerly direction out of Northallerton, followed by a short, sharp ascent on the outskirts of Masham. After a fast section into Risplith, there was barely a flat metre of road. The riders had to keep something in reserve before one last blast into Harrogate and up to the finish line on Parliament Street.Mads Pedersen became Denmark’s first road world champion. “When I saw the finish line I hoped the pain would be gone and I could do a good sprint. After six-and-a-half hours on the bike there is not much left. You have to be focused and stay in front. Don’t get any bad luck. It’s every rider’s dream to wear that jersey. For me to do it now is unbelievable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d52e7422c18c5a2763f062fbedb7f85c75b4d5a/0_69_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82637c056bb77574f969115e5bb11d66","title":"rugby world cup refereeing confusion game","story":"There is a plaque on the wall at Rugby School, commemorating the exploits of William Webb Ellis, who “with a fine disregard for the rules of football first took the ball in his arms and ran with it”. There are reasons to be suspicious about this origin myth. Like the idea, wildly implausible to anyone even vaguely acquainted with the species, that any self-respecting English PE teacher would have praised Webb Ellis’s wit and ingenuity rather than cursed him for his pig-ignorance and set him to doing press-ups in punishment. Still, that’s the story and, two centuries later, it’s Webb Ellis’s name on the trophy that they’re all playing for over here in Japan.For a game that started with “a fine disregard” for the rules, rugby has grown into one that has become irritatingly pernickety about them. This World Cup tournament is supposed to be all about opening the game up to a new audience. One of the main sponsors is running an ad campaign about a confused man in a crowd of rugby fans who isn’t sure whether or when he is supposed to be cheering, till he finally realises it doesn’t much matter anyway. “You don’t need to know all the rules”, their slogan goes. A good thing, too, because they have grown so byzantine that even the experts don’t always seem to agree on them any more.Throughout the opening rounds of this tournament it felt like every other match ended in a spat about who hit who how, when and why and where they did it, and exactly what their punishment ought to be. And all that’s before you even get into the tit-for-tat whatabout of what the guy on the other side got up to in the 52nd minute. The referees don’t seem to agree with the judicial committees, who keep clashing with the coaches, whose players seem to be confused about what they are being told to do by World Rugby, whose instructions seem to be at odds with a lot of what the referees are doing on the field.So we have seen tackles the referee and television match official didn’t think were worth so much as a penalty, but which the disciplinary panel then decided deserved a three-week ban. Tackles that, one head coach was convinced, should have cost the opposition a penalty try, but which went entirely unpunished. Tackles where the referee and television match official agreed there were mitigating circumstances, but the disciplinary panel didn’t, so the players who made them ended up being given the very same sentence as the guy whose appallingly cynical shoulder charge damn near decapitated the man at whom it was aimed.“I am embarrassed here,” said Australia’s head coach, Michael Cheika. “I do not understand any more.” Well, Cheika tends to blow hard when he’s hot. But it’s not just him. After Samoa had two players suspended, their defence coach Alistair Rogers put in a special request to World Rugby’s high-performance manager Alain Rolland for more clarity on exactly what his players were supposed to be doing in the tackle. This was just days after Rolland told us all he was confident that the teams all understood the details of the new high tackle framework because he and his deputies had personally briefed them on it all right before the tournament.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe strange part is that reason they introduced this new framework was so that, as one of the men who designed it explained in a recent podcast, everyone can look at the same tackle and see the same thing. It’s all part of World Rugby’s ongoing effort to overhaul the entire culture of the sport. Which they need to do, and soon, because a game where some concussed players are launching negligence lawsuits against their clubs, and others are being forced into early retirement on medical advice, isn’t going to have much of a long-term future, however many new fans it makes in these few weeks.They are even prepared for the coaches to kick back at it, because they know that they will complain about anything which compromises their team’s performance.What is more problematic is that lack of consistency between what they are saying, what the referees and television match officials are doing, and the judicial review groups are deciding in those hearings. Between them, they are delivering mixed messages. It feels like there has been a communication breakdown. It was a bad omen that no one at the ground has been able to listen to the conversations between the refereeing team during this World Cup because the special ref mic app World Rugby has developed has been broken since the beginning of the tournament. This is difficult stuff, players and referees are making split‑second calls. But right now, World Rugby has got a lot of angry coaches, confused players, inconsistent officials, and befuddled fans. This change in the game is for the good, but it has a long way to go yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82d378b65bd760a7d1999a47eeab3f6e58736c3/1972_408_2836_1701/master/2836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d1977991f72190d1d676fef92a43e5","title":"hammed animashaun nick hytner dream master harold and the boys national theatre london","story":"He’s been a blissful Bottom in Nick Hytner’s Dream and triumphed with the breakneck Barber Shop Chronicles. Now the rising actor is in a 50s political drama that chimes with today’s rise of intoleranceThe first time I meet Hammed Animashaun, Britain is wilting in a heatwave and he is dressed accordingly. He bowls into the bar at the Bridge theatre in London, standing 6ft 3in in a green basketball vest, black shorts, a bandana, assorted beads, rings and necklaces, and white trainers brighter than the afternoon sun. At this point, the genial 28-year-old is midway through the run of Nicholas Hytner’s blissful production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which he is a joyful Bottom. A friend texted him all the wonderful things people have been saying – Time Out named him “man of the match”, the Standard “a master of big-hearted comic nonsense”, the Observer “show-stealing” – but he couldn’t bring himself to look. “I had to delete the chat,” he says, sipping a Diet Coke.In Hytner’s gender-swapping spin, it is Titania who puts a love spell on Oberon, rather than the other way round, so it is Oberon who falls for Bottom. In yellow boiler suit and pert donkey ears, Animashaun laps up the affection, taking it merrily in his stride. “There’s no spell on Bottom. He could just turn around and go, ‘No thanks’, but he doesn’t. Do we have to explain that? I don’t think so. Love is love.”Most of the show’s riotous highlights are his: demanding a mobile phone from the audience before snapping a group selfie of him and his am-dram troupe, or dancing and cavorting with Oberon while their bed is pushed through the crowd. “I love looking out and seeing all those jaws on the floor,” he says. Such gleeful exhibitionism, it should be said, is par for the course for an actor who wore a Lady Gaga-style meat dress as one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella at the Lyric Hammersmith, rocked a pink leopard-print pantsuit and ginger beehive in The Producers at the Manchester Royal Exchange and twerked naked on screen in the debauched British comedy The Festival.Hytner emails later to enthuse about Animashaun. “He has what all the best Shakespeareans have: the ability to make it sound like he just thought of it. Here’s at least one thing he did that hadn’t occurred to me until he did it: he played the morning-after scene like he was kind of over Oberon. That he loved all the treats, the honey, the massage, the champagne, the clothes, but it wasn’t ever going to be much more than a one-night stand and that the other guy was starting to be clingy. Which I thought was hilarious, truthful and rather sad, at least for Oberon.”Animashaun tells me his performance is getting bigger all the time. “I’m still waiting for Nick to tell me to rein it in,” he laughs. “It’s like a party every night. If we didn’t have to finish, I could go on doing this for ever. One hundred per cent.”When we meet again six weeks later backstage at the National Theatre, he cuts a very different figure. He is now deep into rehearsals for “Master Harold” … and the Boys, Athol Fugard’s drama set in 1950s South Africa, in which he and Lucian Msamati play Willie and Sam, two servants whiling away an afternoon by practising ballroom dancing and shooting the breeze with Hally (Anson Boon), the teenage son of their white employers.Picking over a sandwich in his lunch break, Animashaun is relieved to have finally hung up his donkey ears for good and looks aghast when I remind him of his earlier enthusiasm for a bottomless Bottom, a never-ending Dream. “That was when I still had, like, a soul,” he says, shaking his head. “I’m exhausted. I’m done.”Though “Master Harold” … and the Boys makes further demands on his dancing skills (“My calves are killing me”), it represents a change of tempo, swapping the party atmosphere of Shakespeare’s comedy for the simmering tensions of this politically charged three-hander. “Willie is extremely flawed and that’s where the challenges are coming from. He doesn’t say an awful lot but he communicates so much in the choices he makes physically. The way he treats Hally with respect compared to how he treats women. He doesn’t see the problem – when women mess up, you beat them, right? It’s a lot easier in his society to attack a black woman than to attack a white man. It’s the food chain: he chooses the weaker animal.”Animashaun remembers going to the library in Tower Hamlets, London, as a child to read up on apartheid. “I was so shocked. I grew up in an area where all you saw was different sorts of people, and that was amazing. I never had any racism directed at me until I was older, but, even at that young age, I knew it wasn’t right.”I ask where the racism came from. “It’s happened a few times in the industry in quite subtle ways. You hear stories or someone will say directly, ‘The only reason you got this job is cos you’re black.’ And then you go, ‘Wait. That’s racist.’” He has also experienced hostility outside work. “You get people hurling things, screaming things. That was a long time ago. But look at today’s world. I was on a train and this guy was sitting beside me watching a Tommy Robinson video. That’s how open everyone is about it right now.” He scans the walls, momentarily lost for words. “What could I say to him? I wouldn’t know where to start.”He’s in no doubt about where the rise in intolerance has come from. “It’s the leaders. One hundred per cent. When you’ve got a prime minister saying women in burqas look like bank robbers and letterboxes, and a president mocking disability and calling Mexicans rapists, then it allows people to think, ‘Well, if they can say that stuff, I definitely can.’” He was thrilled to see the Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi take the prime minister to task over his use of derogatory language. What would he say to Boris Johnson if he got the chance? “Bro, apologise.”The question of why this is a pertinent time to stage “Master Harold” … and the Boys barely needs answering. “The play isn’t just about race. It’s also about love and friendship, and today those things are more important than ever. Sam has this amazing speech about how ballroom dancers don’t bump into one another because everyone’s doing the right steps. If everyone thought about love and acceptance, there wouldn’t be any bumping. Hally isn’t the problem it’s his society. We’ve got kids growing up saying hateful things because of the society they’re being raised in. How about if we told them that anyone could be whoever they want to be and still be regarded as a person of relevance and importance?”Theatre has played a big role in building Animashaun’s own self-esteem. He was doing poorly at school when his drama teacher encouraged his mother to sign him up to the Half Moon Children’s Theatre in Limehouse, telling her: “He’ll thrive.” And he did. He was at the National in 2016 in Rufus Norris’s staging of The Threepenny Opera and Michael Longhurst’s spectacular revival of Amadeus, being flirted with by Olivia Colman in the Channel 4 comedy Flowers and turning up in BBC3’s Pls Like as a YouTuber whose anti-aggression campaign is called Let’s Punch Violence in the Head and Break Its Jaw.His professional highlight so far, though, was the original production of Barber Shop Chronicles, the breakneck compendium of stories of black male life from across the globe. “I got very emotional gazing out from the stage each night and seeing young men in the audience who looked just like me, who know what it’s like to be a young black man in this country. That show was for the culture.”Indeed, Animashaun’s appeal is instant and wide-ranging, as Hytner explains: “The audience sees him and they think, ‘He’s our guy.’ This is a gift that can’t be taught or faked. I predict an immense career. I imagine he could play more or less anything.” Just so long as he doesn’t have to see himself doing it. He sat through the NT Live broadcast of Amadeus “with one eye closed” and won’t be watching A Midsummer Night’s Dream when it reaches cinemas this month.“Oh my gosh,” he grimaces. “No one needs to see this face on the big screen.” But they do. And they will. One hundred per cent.• “Master Harold” … and the Boys is at the National Theatre, London, until 17 December. A Midsummer Night’s Dream is broadcast in cinemas by NT Live from 17 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d15e7605d06515d0bba590b3c101ba27fe5b572/606_505_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bba29311c226d35a1055b5aea7b91f26","title":"iphone 11 review iphone xr dual camera a13 smartphone","story":"Apple’s lower cost model has latest chips and longer battery life but is identical on outside to predecessorThe iPhone 11 is Apple’s latest lower cost smartphone for 2019 that’s clearly aimed at a broader market, offering most of what its top phones do but for £320 less.Costing from £729, the iPhone 11 is also £20 cheaper than last year’s iPhone XR was on launch – the phone it has now replaced.In fact the iPhone 11 is identical on the outside to the iPhone XR in almost all the ways that matter. It’s the same size and weight. It’s got the same glass and aluminium design, same 6.1in LCD screen with rounded corners, the same large notch at the top and same thick bezels around the sides.Flip it over and it’s got the same glass rear, except that “iPhone” is no longer written on the back and the Apple logo is positioned lower. The biggest difference is the new large, square camera lump in the top left corner, which on the iPhone 11 houses a new dual camera system.The phone is well built, feeling extremely solid and it has the best LCD screen you’re likely to see on a phone although it isn’t as good-looking, colour rich, bright or high contrast as the OLED screens fitted to the iPhone 11 Pro or Apple’s many rivals costing £500 and up.The iPhone 11 also suffers from the same disadvantages as the iPhone XR before it, namely it’s fairly heavy and wide with rounded edges that provide little in the way of grip. Compared to Samsung’s Galaxy S10, which has the same size 6.1in screen, the iPhone 11 is 5.3mm wider and 37g heavier and significantly harder to use one-handed.The iPhone 11 shares the same core as the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max: Apple’s latest A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage. It’s the fastest and most efficient of Apple’s chips yet, but the reality is that it’s very difficult to tell. The iPhone 11 doesn’t feel any faster than last year’s iPhone XRXS, or in fact the iPhone X in day-to-day usage.That’s not surprising as Apple focuses its chips on doing the things you’d normally do more efficiently, with power to do something unusual if you need it. That means the iPhone 11 should still be a top-performer in two, three, maybe four years from now. So really the only thing you need to know is that the iPhone 11 will handle everything you are likely to do, and then some.Apple also says that it’s managed to make the iPhone 11 last an hour longer than the iPhone XR, which lasted 32 hours between charges in my testing.I’m happy to report that’s a bit of an underestimate. The iPhone 11 lasts closer to 35 hours between charges, which makes it the longest-lasting iPhone to have crossed my test bench, getting me from 7am though until 6pm the following day.That was after the iOS 13.1.1 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 150 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The iPhone 11 came out of the box with iOS 13 but was quickly updated to iOS 13.1 and then iOS 13.1.1, which was a good thing, as prior to the updates it was filled with bugs giving me all kinds of issues on three different iPhone 11 series phones.First off, the camera confirmation for restoring it from another iPhone didn’t work. Then I was immediately stuck in a password-demand loop for an email account, which ended up with me having to hit the cancel button and then quickly enter one character of my 35-character password before the password demand popped back up blocking me from entering more. Hit cancel, rinse and repeat. Absolutely infuriating.I had issues with location permissions getting stuck on “ask every time” for some apps. I also had several hard lockups of the phone prompting the three-button combo force restart procedure (up, down, hold power for ages), text in widgets and other areas was compressed and overlapping each other, and sometimes the camera failed to activate when launched.Most of the problems have been solved since the update to iOS 13.1.1, and it even added an extra hour to my battery tests.The big new features for iOS 13 are dark mode, which turns the interface from a predominately black text on white background to white text on a dark background, either manually or on a schedule.You can now also long-press on control centre buttons such as Bluetooth or wifi, first to open a up more detail, then a second time to open up a quick connect menu as well as a button to take you straight to the appropriate place in the settings app for more extensive changes. It is a user-friendly feature that Android has had for years, so it’s good to finally see Apple catch up.A few new privacy options are welcome, including the ability to silence unknown and spam callers and finer-grain location permissions. Menstrual cycle tracking is now integrated into the Health app alongside headphone audio level, and there’s a new summary view, which makes the app more friendly and useful at a glance.It’s worth pointing out that Apple still provides the industry’s longest software support lifecycle of about five years from release where the best rivals cap out at about three years. It means you can safely use the phone for longer as you will continue to get important security updates as well as new features via iOS version updates.The iPhone 11 has a new dual 12-megapixel camera on the back. Oddly you get an ultra-wide camera alongside a standard camera, not the more typical 2x optical zoom camera. That means you’ve effectively got 0.5x and 1x optical zoom then up to 5x digital zoom, which is good, but doesn’t hold a flame to real optical zoom.Apple has significantly upped its game in the camera department this year, particularly in poor lighting conditions. Photos in good lighting conditions are some of the best on a smartphone, producing detail-rich and colour-accurate photos. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with.Other than your typical ultra-wide vistas, you can also use the new camera to photograph more of a building or object you can’t get far enough away from to use the main camera.Portrait mode is good too, and unlike on the XR can be used on more than just people. Apple’s smart HDR mode is also improved, producing images that are closer to class-leading Google Pixel cameras. But the biggest boost is Apple’s new night mode, which finally brings the iPhone’s very low-light performance up to scratch with the very best.It’s not as fast as Huawei’s P30 Pro, which doesn’t need a special night mode to shoot similar photos, nor quite as dramatic as Google’s Pixel 3, but produces images that are often lighter and better controlled.The automatic mode takes multiple frames between one and three seconds when handheld, depending on available light and how much you are shaking the phone. Stick it on a tripod and you can set it to 30 seconds, which is best illustrated with starry sky shots – something I couldn’t test in dank, rainy Britain.The iPhone still struggles a little with indoor lighting where it’s not quite dark enough to benefit from night mode so produces images that are a little dark and lacking in detail. The selfie camera in particular produces somewhat grainy images here, but shoots great photos in better lighting conditions.Video capture from the rear camera is fantastic, and easy to use, arguably better than rivals. The front-facing camera can also offers slow-motion selfies, which kids will love.Overall the camera on the iPhone 11 is a big step up, equalling or exceeding rivals from the first half of 2019 in the most important features, although the lack of an optical zoom is disappointing.The iPhone 11 is an excellent but boring smartphone. It’s got a three-year-old design, which Apple broke the mould with in 2017 when it launched the iPhone X but now looks dated against the competition, particularly with the thicker bezels on the LCD screen. Things have moved on in the era of the all-screen smartphone.It’s fairly large, heavy and difficult to grip and use with one hand, but is also extremely well made and feels solid. These are all attributes shared by its predecessor the iPhone XR, as the iPhone 11 is essentially new guts in last year’s design.At £729 the iPhone 11 isn’t exactly cheap, costing the same as the top-of-the-line phones from competitors. But what you get for your £729 is Apple’s latest top-of-the-range processor with performance to match. Battery life that will easily see you into a second day, maybe a third if you’re careful. Camera performance that is up there with the very best, but lacking an optical zoom, replaced instead by a fun ultra-wide angle camera.You also get five years of software updates, which can’t be sniffed at. With a battery swap at some point there’s no reason an iPhone 11 won’t last you five years if you’re careful with it. In some tests the glass appears fairly tough to break, but less so in others, so whether it will survive real-world drops remains to be seen.If your primary driver is to buy the best, cheapest iPhone you can get, that’s the iPhone XR in 2019. If you want the best iPhone you can get, that’s one of the new iPhone 11 Pro line. So where does that leave the iPhone 11?Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, dated design, expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

His name conjures up images of sunsets, cowboy hats and Marlboro Reds. But the legacy of the late film star is undergoing fresh interrogation after a controversial 1971 Playboy interview resurfaced online in which the actor made racist and homophobic comments. Now, there are growing calls to rename the John Wayne airport, located in Orange county, in response to the actor’s troubling political views.The idea of renaming an airport because of a namesake’s controversial political views might have seemed far-fetched a decade ago, but not anymore.A host of public schools and colleges have renamed academic buildings and dorms that honor Confederate leaders. Efforts to rename DC’s Reagan airport, in response to Ronald Reagan’s war on crime, which disproportionately affected people of color, have been on-and-off since 2015. Barack Obama arguably cleared the way for major name-changes when he used his executive power to rename Mount McKinley to Denali, the mountain peak’s original name among the area’s indigenous population.So names can change.Up until now, John Wayne’s legacy has occupied a comfortable, permanent position in American history. Wayne starred in over 70 films, received a Congressional Medal of Honor and a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom.There are a lot of places named after him. There’s an elementary school in Brooklyn, a marina in Washington state, a highway in central Arizona, a park in Newport Beach.Wayne was disturbingly forthcoming and direct in the Playboy interview when it came to his racism. “I believe in white supremacy until the blacks are educated to a point of responsibility,” he told Playboy in 1971. “I don’t believe in giving authority and positions of leadership and judgment to irresponsible people.”Is it possible to rewrite the legacy of the biggest movie star of all time?“For many years, I have been troubled with the decision to name an airport after John Wayne because of his bigoted views on African Americans, the LGBT+ community and Native Americans,” Whiting says of his decision to write his isive call for action. “Although most of the hundreds of online and email comments are passionately negative, there are also notes of support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05d7eee223932962fbb414b02d1be8bff5fc2bd/0_191_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=568373ea0dc0cdbe073c7470aaf591c6","title":"russian alcohol consumption down 40 since 2003 who","story":"Reputation for heavy drinking on the slide since Putin measures including curbs on alcohol salesThe WHO put the decrease down to a series of measures brought in under the sport-loving president, Vladimir Putin, including restrictions on alcohol sales and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.“The Russian Federation has long been considered one of the heaviest-drinking countries in the world,” the report, published on Tuesday, says, adding that alcohol was a major contributor to a spike in the number of deaths in the 1990s. “However, in recent years these trends have been reversed,” it says.The authors said this trend was a factor in increased life expectancies in Russia, which reached a historic peak in 2018, at 78 years for women and 68 years for men. In the early 1990s, male life expectancy was just 57 years.The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, led an anti-alcohol campaign with partial prohibition, which brought down consumption from the mid-1980s until 1990. But after the collapse of the Soviet Union, alcohol consumption exploded, continuing to rise until the start of the 2000s.Under Putin, Russia has introduced measures including a ban on shops selling any alcohol after 11pm, increases in the minimum retail price of spirits and an advertising blackout.Earlier WHO figures showed Russian adults drink less alcohol on average than their French and German counterparts.Moscow has also launched a drive against smoking, last week announcing a ban on lighting up, even on private balconies."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Social Justice Ireland calls for environmental tax of up to \u0026euro30 per passenger per flightAlone has seen 145 people presenting as homeless or at risk of homelessness so far in 2019Charge against Gerard Melia (31) upgrade from assault causing harmMedical organisations say about 500 consultant posts remain permanently unfilledResidents in one centre left in bed until noon and placed in dining area long before meals servedHurricane Lorenzo will be latest storm to hit country should it arrive on ThursdayProposal to convert Connemara Gateway Hotel into direct provision centre sparked protestsINMO blames high levels of overcrowding across the State on staff and bed shortagesAs street violence reaches record high, we want to hear your storiesNational Emergency Co-Ordination Group expecting heavy rainfall on ThursdayDecision amounts to rejection of advice given by State advisory body on the curriculumOver 10,330 destitute in the Republic, according to latest Government figuresDeal hopes fade as British proposls dismissed completely by the Republic and the EUReport includes draft legislation for recommendations to be implemented without delayOver $400m \u0026lsquolaundered\u0026rsquo via funds with accounts in State and abroad, say prosecutorsInquiries concerning corporate governance at association yet to reveal findingsProposed changes will free Enterprise Ireland to help companies affected by BrexitNon-paper on customs posts relies \u0026lsquoon technology that does not yet exist\u0026rsquo Keir Starmer says"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4036103.1569927437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan for oughterard asylum seeker centre is abandoned","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe owner of the  former Connemara Gateway Hotel had applied to covert the building into a   direct provision centre Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy The developer of a hotel in Oughterard which was earmarked to open as a direct provision centre says he has withdrawn his tender and will not be proceeding with the development.Speaking on Galway Bay FM on Tuesday morning, Sean Lyons, owner of the Fazyard Limited company, said the development of the former Connemara Gateway hotel would “100 per cent” not be going ahead.Protestors have maintained an almost constant presence outside the hotel since a community meeting was held in the town in early September opposing plans for a direct provision centre to open in the area.Mr Lyons criticised the Department of Justice for its lack of communication in recent weeks, saying his company was left at the forefront of the debate without clarity around the project. Mr Lyons confirmed he had informed the Reception and Integration Agency of his decision to withdraw on Monday.Department of Justice officials had been in negotiations with Fazyard about a tender to open a centre to house “less than 250 people” in the former hotel but no final decision had been made. The residents for new centre in Oughterard would most likely have come from some of the 33 emergency accommodation centres around the country where 1,250 people are currently residing.The businessman said he also contacted the protest committee requesting that his workers be allowed to access the site to collect their tools but that they had not been allowed past the blockade yet. He reiterated the request on radio, saying once the tools and equipment was gone he would be “finished with the premises, we’ll be gone”.“It’s just not worth it from the point of view of the workmen and their safety, all they’re trying to do is work,” he said.“Nobody is happy with this situation. We needed more support and there should have been more information given out.”‘Very unsatisfactory’Fine Gael TD Seán Kyne described the situation in Oughterard in recent weeks as “very unsatisfactory” and agreed that there had been a “lack of information around the process and secrecy”.Mr Kyne said he had “made it clear to all ministers” that the consultation process around the opening of direct provision centres needed to change. “It’s something that lessons have to learned from in terms of the department of justice.”He added that damage had been done to the name of Oughterard. “We need to work to change that because there have been people who have commented to me that they’re very upset and won’t shop again in Oughterard. This wasn’t asked for by Oughterard.”A statement from Patrick Curran, who has led the campaign against the centre, commended Mr Lyons for choosing to pull out of the tender and the department for “admitting they got it wrong”.He also thanked the local Oughterard community for their support during the campaign.“We have not only cancelled the centre in Oughterard, we have made a positive change for the people of Ireland and also for the asylum seekers themselves,” said Mr Curran following the announcement.“This started out as a village opposed to a direct provision centre but in ended up as a village finding its voice and standing up for an entire nation on behalf of democracy and humanity. We stood up for the people that had no voice.”A spokesman for the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) welcomed the news that a new direct provision centre would not be opening and called on the department of justice to focus on the integration of asylum seekers into the community as per the recommendations laid out by the special rapporteur on child protection.He said MASI was surprised to see such strong calls against the system from Oughterard given that the community had never expressed support to end the asylum system before plans emerged for a centre to open in their backyard. “We hope to see them campaigning against direct provision as the system remains in place,” he said, adding that the Government must also end its reliance on emergency accommodation solutions for new arrivals."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"In pictures: China\u0026rsquos 70th celebrations contrast starkly with pro-democracy protestsTens of thousands march in territory on Communist Party anniversaryDivers search for those feared trapped in vesselsCelebrations come amid challenges of trade war with US and Hong Kong unrestPolice warn that protesters are about to commit acts \u0026lsquoone step closer to terrorism\u0026rsquoAuthorities believe a vehicle drove through an Australian suburb targeting the animalsBoats deployed in city of Patna to rescue residents, 900 inmates moved from prisonPrayut Chan-o-cha mulls relocation to help tackle chronic congestion and pollutionChaos erupts during march organised to denounce \u0026lsquoChina\u0026rsquos tyranny\u0026rsquoPreliminary count suggests lowest participation since 2001, with accusations of fraudDemonstrators tear down signs for 70th anniversary of China\u0026rsquos Communist PartyResults of first round in presidential ballot will not be released until mid-OctoberIncumbent Ashraf Ghani is facing a major challenge from his former chief executiveCountry\u0026rsquos famous hospitality is rolled out for more than half a million tournament visitorsLegislation revamping law that made abortion punishable prison sentence passed by voice votePolice say situation returning to normal as rescue operation gets under wayRocks hurled at parliament over Bill to curb extramarital sex and insulting presidentHardcore group of protesters says extreme actions needed to get government\u0026rsquos attention\u0026lsquoThis can only be fantasy\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Greta Thunberg in New York, responding to global actionCommunist Party gears up to dictate who will be reincarnated as the next Dalai Lama"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearNoted commodity trader Peter Brandt predicted bitcoin will continue to fall until it reaches $5,500, but will then continue its upward trajectory.In the long term, he forecasted bitcoin to be worth $50,000 – a figure seen as conservative by some cryptocurrency advocates.Cyber security pioneer John McAfee, who has become a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, stood by a prediction he made in 2017 that bitcoin will see exponential price growth in 2019 and 2020.“Ignore this drop in bitcoin’s price. I am firmly with Peter Brandt in his medium term $50k price prediction,” Mr McAfee tweeted.“I am also firm on my $1m price by the end of 2020. Stop wringing your hands!”It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for bitcoin’s most recent demise, though some have said negative market sentiment can be attributed to the launch of the bitcoin futures platform Bakkt.Pessimism surrounding Bakkt resulted in a mass sell-off, which at one point saw more than $1,000 wiped from bitcoin’s value in the space of 30 minutes.Bitcoin’s notorious volatility could see traders once again plough money into the cryptocurrency in the hope of turning a quick profit, according to market analyst Simon Peters, who works for online trading platform eToro.“Now that bitcoin is now trading below $8,500, it could become an attractive proposition for investors who want to buy the dip,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We could see the price rise back up to $10,000 within the space of the next month.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes up over 7 per cent of Britain’s GDP, around 9 per cent of our exports and 11 per cent of all tax receipts.The quarterly survey by the Confederation of British Industry and PwC showed that optimism has plunged at the fastest rate since September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering panic around the world. Only 5 per cent of firms are now more upbeat about\u0026nbspoverall business in financial services\u0026nbspthan three months ago, while 62 per cent are less optimistic, giving a balance of -56 per cent.Business volumes declined in the past three months at the fastest pace since September 2012. Banks experienced a particularly alarming fall, with the volume of business dropping more rapidly than at any time since March 1991.Meanwhile, the fall in profits across financial services firms was the worst since June 2009, when Britain was still mired in recession. And firms expected profitability to slide further in the next three months.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two tourists pose for pictures in front of Union and EU flags outside the Houses of Parliament in LondonA sheep on London Bridge as Freemen of the City of London took up their historic entitlement to drive sheep over the bridge, which was once London\u0027s only river crossingAn Aldabra giant tortoise is fed watermelon as a treat at the Malvern Autumn Show, at the Three Counties Showground near Malvern in WorcestershireGallery assistants pose with an artwork entitled \u0027Devolved Parliament\u0027 by British artist Banksy, during a press view in London ahead of Sotheby\u0027s contemporary art sale, as part of the Frieze Art FairEngland\u0027s Jonathan Joseph is tackled by United State\u0027s Marcel Brache during their group match at the Rugby World Cup in Japan.

No ifs, no buts, the government must heed the call to avoid a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit and secure an ambitious deal with our largest trading partner.”Whether or not Britain\u0026nbspleaves\u0026nbspthe EU with or without an agreement, financial services firms said Brexit will have a negative impact on their business over the coming year.A wider survey released on Monday found the same view among UK firms across other sectors, with concerns intensifying sharply since August.In a rare positive finding, the CBI PwC survey revealed that employment across financial services grew at the fastest pace in over a year. Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said the increase was most probably a response to greater regulation requirements.The poll was conducted between 14 August and 13 September, with 83 firms replying.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it’s also very much about a giant blob of goo that consumes everything in its wake. A pre-fame Steve McQueen in his feature film debut is the preppie high-schooler facing off against the aggressive alien entity. Burt Bacharach sings the film’s theme song¬ – driving home The Blob’s kitsch, drive-in-movie charm.210 The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976 Nicholas Roeg)If the experience of being abducted by aliens was translated into a cinematic mood, it would result in something like The Man Who Fell to Earth. It dispenses with all logic and concept of linear time, and instead takes place in a kind of unmoored netherworld (Nicholas Roeg fans will recognise and appreciate it immediately). And its power is punctuated, of course, by the presence of David Bowie, who is beautiful and uncanny, and perfectly cast.310 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 Philip Kaufman)We’re long-overdue a new remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The pod-people premise is effortlessly translated into new decades, and spun into powerful new metaphors for modern threats. But of the many incarnations of Jack Finney’s novel, it’s Philip Kaufman’s 1978 adaptation that remains its most terrifying and daring, exploiting the Cold War paranoia of the era and building to a devastatingly brutal final twist. Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and a young Jeff Goldblum are among the stars confronted with an alien invasion that replaces the world’s populace with mindless doppelgängers.The original and still the best. And not just in terms of the long-running Alien franchise, but the alien genre as a whole. Chilly and sparse, with moments of languid contemplation interrupted by bloody carnage, Alien is both a haunted house movie and delicate meditation on life, power and authority. HR Giger’s ubiquitous design work remains terrifying, and Sigourney Weaver is an instant star as the compassionate and smart Ellen Ripley.A film that taught a generation of children (and, if we’re being honest, their parents) the importance of friendship, whether shared with an intergalactic gremlin or not. ET is magical cinema and the finest distillation of Steven Spielberg’s power as a filmmaker – emotional but never cloying, otherworldly but always resolutely human, and with a deep understanding and respect for child-like wonder. Anyone who isn’t in a puddle of tears by its conclusion is, I think according to international law, an irredeemable monster.Liquid Sky is a fluorescent revenge tale, a hyper-stylised fever dream, and the most vivid depiction of New York’s underground no-wave scene in the early 1980s. It sees aliens arriving in New York in search of heroin, only to discover better highs via the human orgasm. Meanwhile an aspiring, put-upon model learns that alien powers can be a tool to rid the world of bad people. Liquid Sky touches on sex, drugs, art and androgyny, with eye-candy set design and a transfixing lead performance from Anne Carlisle.Starman is ET if ET was an incredibly handsome 30-something man who looks uncannily like your dead ex. A radical departure for John Carpenter, this 1984 romantic drama sees Karen Allen’s grief-stricken widow spooked and then saved by the arrival of an alien who takes the form of her dead husband. An Oscar-nominated Jeff Bridges stars as the Starman of the title he is astounding, tasked with embodying something odd and otherworldly yet warm enough to be loveable. The film’s climax, in all its aching, deeply romantic glory, is a tribute to maintaining hope in the face of grief, and proof that Carpenter is no one-genre pony.Worth revisiting in the wake of the Amy Adams vehicle Arrival, Contact finds Jodie Foster communicating with aliens and fighting for the right to meet them. It is a still, thoughtful movie, interested in bureaucracy and misogyny in a way that sci-fi movies so often aren’t. But it also recognises the emotional power of marvelling at something extraordinary, and the sheer wonder of cracking open a door to the previously unimaginable. Robert Zemeckis hasn’t done anything of a similar quality in the decades since.A genre-splicing teen thriller that could only have been birthed in an era of Scream and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Faculty sees a cluster of disparate high schoolers (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall among them) become convinced that their teachers have been replaced by aliens (the likes of Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen and a scene-stealing Robert Patrick having been transformed into pod-people overnight). Sweet, pulpy and dripping in Gen-X cool, The Faculty is Body Snatchers by way of The Breakfast Club, with the cheery spookiness of an RL Stine book you loved when you were 13.1010 Under the Skin (2013 Jonathan Glazer)Alien movies are unusual in that they’re always driven by outsiders and extra-terrestrials, yet almost always anchored by us, the humans. Under the Skin, a characteristically trippy experiment from visionary filmmaker Jonathan Glazer (Birth, Sexy Beast), is us as seen through the eyes of a beguiling and curious alien played by Scarlett Johansson. She marvels at human idiosyncrasies and our faces, or else delights in our chocolate cake. And in a further twist, she finds that she likes us. Under the Skin is uncomfortable and horrifying yet also unusually tender, and proof that we haven’t yet run out of new ways to depict alien visitors.Under the SkinSo eager are we to plant metaphors onto alien movies that The Blob has been referred to as everything from an analogy for the Cold War to a grim warning against the perils of capitalism. But it’s also very much about a giant blob of goo that consumes everything in its wake. A pre-fame Steve McQueen in his feature film debut is the preppie high-schooler facing off against the aggressive alien entity. Burt Bacharach sings the film’s theme song¬ – driving home The Blob’s kitsch, drive-in-movie charm.210 The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976 Nicholas Roeg)If the experience of being abducted by aliens was translated into a cinematic mood, it would result in something like The Man Who Fell to Earth. It dispenses with all logic and concept of linear time, and instead takes place in a kind of unmoored netherworld (Nicholas Roeg fans will recognise and appreciate it immediately). And its power is punctuated, of course, by the presence of David Bowie, who is beautiful and uncanny, and perfectly cast.310 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 Philip Kaufman)We’re long-overdue a new remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The pod-people premise is effortlessly translated into new decades, and spun into powerful new metaphors for modern threats. But of the many incarnations of Jack Finney’s novel, it’s Philip Kaufman’s 1978 adaptation that remains its most terrifying and daring, exploiting the Cold War paranoia of the era and building to a devastatingly brutal final twist. Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy and a young Jeff Goldblum are among the stars confronted with an alien invasion that replaces the world’s populace with mindless doppelgängers.The original and still the best. And not just in terms of the long-running Alien franchise, but the alien genre as a whole. Chilly and sparse, with moments of languid contemplation interrupted by bloody carnage, Alien is both a haunted house movie and delicate meditation on life, power and authority. HR Giger’s ubiquitous design work remains terrifying, and Sigourney Weaver is an instant star as the compassionate and smart Ellen Ripley.A film that taught a generation of children (and, if we’re being honest, their parents) the importance of friendship, whether shared with an intergalactic gremlin or not. ET is magical cinema and the finest distillation of Steven Spielberg’s power as a filmmaker – emotional but never cloying, otherworldly but always resolutely human, and with a deep understanding and respect for child-like wonder. Anyone who isn’t in a puddle of tears by its conclusion is, I think according to international law, an irredeemable monster.Liquid Sky is a fluorescent revenge tale, a hyper-stylised fever dream, and the most vivid depiction of New York’s underground no-wave scene in the early 1980s. It sees aliens arriving in New York in search of heroin, only to discover better highs via the human orgasm. Meanwhile an aspiring, put-upon model learns that alien powers can be a tool to rid the world of bad people. Liquid Sky touches on sex, drugs, art and androgyny, with eye-candy set design and a transfixing lead performance from Anne Carlisle.Starman is ET if ET was an incredibly handsome 30-something man who looks uncannily like your dead ex. A radical departure for John Carpenter, this 1984 romantic drama sees Karen Allen’s grief-stricken widow spooked and then saved by the arrival of an alien who takes the form of her dead husband. An Oscar-nominated Jeff Bridges stars as the Starman of the title he is astounding, tasked with embodying something odd and otherworldly yet warm enough to be loveable. The film’s climax, in all its aching, deeply romantic glory, is a tribute to maintaining hope in the face of grief, and proof that Carpenter is no one-genre pony.Worth revisiting in the wake of the Amy Adams vehicle Arrival, Contact finds Jodie Foster communicating with aliens and fighting for the right to meet them. It is a still, thoughtful movie, interested in bureaucracy and misogyny in a way that sci-fi movies so often aren’t. But it also recognises the emotional power of marvelling at something extraordinary, and the sheer wonder of cracking open a door to the previously unimaginable. Robert Zemeckis hasn’t done anything of a similar quality in the decades since.A genre-splicing teen thriller that could only have been birthed in an era of Scream and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Faculty sees a cluster of disparate high schoolers (Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett and Clea DuVall among them) become convinced that their teachers have been replaced by aliens (the likes of Salma Hayek, Famke Janssen and a scene-stealing Robert Patrick having been transformed into pod-people overnight). Sweet, pulpy and dripping in Gen-X cool, The Faculty is Body Snatchers by way of The Breakfast Club, with the cheery spookiness of an RL Stine book you loved when you were 13.1010 Under the Skin (2013 Jonathan Glazer)Alien movies are unusual in that they’re always driven by outsiders and extra-terrestrials, yet almost always anchored by us, the humans. Under the Skin, a characteristically trippy experiment from visionary filmmaker Jonathan Glazer (Birth, Sexy Beast), is us as seen through the eyes of a beguiling and curious alien played by Scarlett Johansson. She marvels at human idiosyncrasies and our faces, or else delights in our chocolate cake. And in a further twist, she finds that she likes us. Under the Skin is uncomfortable and horrifying yet also unusually tender, and proof that we haven’t yet run out of new ways to depict alien visitors.Under the SkinAfter Damon trailed off,\u0026nbspinterviewer Stuart McGurk\u0026nbspasked: “He offered you ten per cent of the Avatar profits?”To which Damon replied: “I told John Krasinski this story when we were writing Promised Land...\u0026nbsphe goes, ‘What?’ And he stands up and he starts pacing in the kitchen. He goes, ‘OK. OK. OK. OK. OK.’He goes, ‘If you had done that movie, nothing in your life would be different. Nothing in your life would be different at all. Except that, right now, we would be having this conversation in space.’\u0026nbspDamon added: “So, yeah. I’ve left more money on the table than any actor actually… So that sucked and that’s still brutal. But my kids are all eating. I’m doing OK.”The actor previously revealed he turned down Avatar due to a scheduling\u0026nbspclash with his other films The Bourne Ultimatum and The Green Zone.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Not even when it was introduced with a paragraph describing the story as non-literary.“Readers basically ignored that intro and engaged actively with the text itself anyway.”The paper, titled The Literary Genre Effect, will be published later this year in the journal Scientific Study of Literature.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are the workers’ party.”\u0026nbspShadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Labour offer was worth more to workers, as it would come into effect as soon as the party took power.“This pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody,” said Mr McDonnell.“Labour will introduce £10 as a minimum as soon as we take office and, rising with living costs, it will mean everybody over 16 years of age will be earning comfortably more than £10.50 an hour by 2024.”Opposition parties discuss caretaker government to oust Boris JohnsonGovernment minister has ‘no idea’ how Johnson will deliver Brexit Tories hiring new Brussels staff despite pledge to leave in OctoberDominic Cummings’ wife denies being groped by Boris JohnsonTreasury sources said the rise in National Living Wage would be phased in over the next five years, and the final rate would depend on increases in median wages over that period.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It makes a big difference to 4 million workers.“It is the right balance between addressing people’s cost of living and maintaining a good business environment.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ”The Chancellor’s pre-election promise should be taken with a huge bucket of salt. This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit. If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer.”The general secretary of the Unison union, Dave Prentis, said: “Many people will be wary of the Chancellor’s promises to splash the cash knowing an election is just around the corner.\u0026nbsp“If it’s so easy to conjure up this money now, it’s hard to understand why the government has been running public spending into the ground for a decade.

No ifs, no buts, the government must heed the call to avoid a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit and secure an ambitious deal with our largest trading partner.”Whether or not Britain\u0026nbspleaves\u0026nbspthe EU with or without an agreement, financial services firms said Brexit will have a negative impact on their business over the coming year.A wider survey released on Monday found the same view among UK firms across other sectors, with concerns intensifying sharply since August.In a rare positive finding, the CBI PwC survey revealed that employment across financial services grew at the fastest pace in over a year. Andrew Kail, head of financial services at PwC, said the increase was most probably a response to greater regulation requirements.The poll was conducted between 14 August and 13 September, with 83 firms replying.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is also nervous about threats to the Communist Party’s grip on power, last week warning that the nation would “crumble” if it was not ruled with a firm hand.Created with Sketch.Hong Kong protesters day of grief on communist China anniversary Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hong Kong police fire a water cannon from the central government office at protesters during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters burn a Chinese national flag during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters remove signs celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China during a mass rally in Hong Kong on October 1Cardboard boxes set alight by protesters burn in the streets of Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1An anti-China banner has been placed in a barricade   during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters run after police fire tear gas during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1The rally comes after months of protests on the streets of Hong Kong which began in oppposition to a proposed extradition billThe extradition bill would have allowed the government to extradite people to China if they were facing certain criminal chargesOpposition to the bill stems from the fear that the Chinese government would abuse this power for political or commercial reasonsProtesters soon came to demand greater freedom and universal suffrage under the One Country, Two Systems principleProtesters are wearing black to symbolise opposition to China as they take to the streets in a day of grief while the Chinese state celebrates the 70th anniversary of its communist foundingA protester charges forward holding umbrellas as a mass rally breaks out in violence in Hong Kong on October 1A protester pours water on a tear gas canister fired by police during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 A protester carries a vandalised Chinese flag through Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 Protesters carry a banner that denounces the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Hong Kong police fire a water cannon from the central government office at protesters during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters burn a Chinese national flag during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters remove signs celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China during a mass rally in Hong Kong on October 1Cardboard boxes set alight by protesters burn in the streets of Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1An anti-China banner has been placed in a barricade   during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1Protesters run after police fire tear gas during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1The rally comes after months of protests on the streets of Hong Kong which began in oppposition to a proposed extradition billThe extradition bill would have allowed the government to extradite people to China if they were facing certain criminal chargesOpposition to the bill stems from the fear that the Chinese government would abuse this power for political or commercial reasonsProtesters soon came to demand greater freedom and universal suffrage under the One Country, Two Systems principleProtesters are wearing black to symbolise opposition to China as they take to the streets in a day of grief while the Chinese state celebrates the 70th anniversary of its communist foundingA protester charges forward holding umbrellas as a mass rally breaks out in violence in Hong Kong on October 1A protester pours water on a tear gas canister fired by police during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 A protester carries a vandalised Chinese flag through Hong Kong during a mass rally on the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1 Protesters carry a banner that denounces the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of communist China on October 1The crowd that Mr Xi addressed was carefully vetted, and members of the public trying to access Tiananmen Square on the day were turned away. People with houses lining the parade route were told not to look out of their windows.As the parade gathered in the square, Mr Xi descended to street level and inspected row upon row of gleaming military hardware. Riding in a black limousine he shouted: “Hello comrades”, to replies from the soldiers of “Follow the Party! Fight to win! Forge exemplary conduct!”The event highlighted rapidly developing Chinese weapons technology that foreign analysts say is close to matching the US, Russia and Europe in missiles, drones and some other fields.China’s campaign of military modernisation has alarmed its neighbours in the region, not least because Beijing lays claim to the entirety of the contested South China Sea, as well as independently-run Taiwan and some Japanese islands.One of the most closely-watched weapons unveiled Tuesday was the Dongfeng-17, a nuclear-capable glider that foreign analysts say is designed to manoeuvre at high speed to evade anti-missile defences.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Analysts say it may be able to carry as many as 10 warheads to hit separate targets.\u0026nbspThe People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the world’s biggest military with 2 million men and women in uniform, also had the world’s second-highest military spending at an estimated $250bn last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The US, with a force of 1.3 million people, led in spending at $650bn.China has about 280 nuclear warheads, compared with 6,450 for the United States and 6,850 for Russia, according to SIPRI. Beijing says it wants a “minimum credible nuclear deterrent” but won’t be the first to use atomic weapons in a conflict.And Mr Xi also emphasised China’s commitment to “firmly uphold world peace”, saying that the country would pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up.After the military aspect of the parade was complete, 70,000 balloons and 70,000 doves – symbolising peace – were released into the smoggy Beijing air. A large fireworks display is planned for the evening.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It wasn’t to be.I first noticed Demi in , when she appeared in the movie Ghost, as fresh-faced, husky-voiced Molly, mourning the death of her husband Sam, played by Patrick Swayze.She looked adorable, with elfin cropped hair, little make-up and denim dungarees.Everyone wanted to look like this particularly gorgeous “girl next door” and that role catapulted her on to Hollywood’s A-list.Demi made a string of successful but rather questionable movies including Indecent Proposal, Striptease and GI Jane and demanded such high fees she was dubbed “Gimme Moore”, the sort of snarky comment that would never be made about a male actor.Her marriage to Bruce Willis made them the Brad and Angelina of their day, but just like that relationship, theirs too ended in tears and failure.Demi and Bruce went on to declare a truce and he was even at the launch of her new book in a show of support — although you do have to wonderhe had actually read what his ex had written about him.She claims that at the height of her fame he wanted her out of Hollywood so she could be a stay-at-home mum for their children.What strikes me about Demi’s story — from her being raped as a vulnerable  year old, to her complete ­mental breakdown after her marriage to Kutcher fell apart — was what a deeply unhappy le she has led.I honestly don’t know how any young girl would recover from being raped by a disgusting pervert who she claims “bought her” for a few hundred dollars from her alcoholic mother.How on Earth are you supposed to deal with such a horric betrayal from the one person who is supposed to love and protect you from harm It is very sad that Demi said she always felt that she was to blame for the appalling ordeal inflicted upon her by her mother and a man old enough to be her father.I think deep down she’s still that frightened, betrayed little girl who never thinks she is quite good enough.Demi writes movingly about being desperate to have a child with Kutcher.Shortly after their marriage she became pregnant, but tragically the baby died when she was six months pregnant.Again she blamed herself for the loss, and started drinking heavily.The relationship never really recovered. Years later ,just before the couple split, I interviewed Kutcher and it wasn’t a happy experience for all concerned.He wasn’t unpleasant, just deeply uncomfortable and clearly didn’t want to be promoting his latest project, but it was in his contract to so do.Everyone that day received monosyllabic replies and it was no surprise when the news broke shortly afterwards that his marriage to Demi had crumbled and that was when she started to really unravel.Even though on the outside Demi appeared to have everything — fame, enormous wealth, three healthy children and a handsome actor on her arm — inside she was a mass of ­anxiety and insecurities as she lurched from one crisis to the next.She came close to death a year after the split while partying with her oldest daughter Rumer. Demi suffered a seizure after taking drugs and inhaling nitrous oxide.That was a wake-up call for her to seek help and get her act together. Writing the book is apparently all part of the healing process.It won’t have been an easy read for her three grown-up daughters who, unsurprisingly, have apparently had their own issues with either substance abuse or insecurity about their bodies.I honestly do wonderanyone in Hollywood, especially those who find fame because of their good looks and winning smiles, are living happy, ­contented and fulfilled lives.It doesn’t look like it, and it’s deeply sad that a seemingly confident, extremely beautul woman such as Demi should have felt so worthless.All credit to her for coming back from the brink and having the guts to tell her story in her own words.But there is always collateral damage when you decide to be so honest, and I hope she is strong enough to weather the inevitable storms gathering on the horizon.Harry and Meghan brought out a secret weapon during their visit to South Africa and instantly blew away all the negativity and criticism they have experienced this year.With one cute smile and a whole lot of gurgles, baby Archie has completely rehabilitated his parents and shown them in a much happier and far more positive light.It is the first time we have properly seen the four month old and you do wonder why they haven’t shown him to the world before now.Everybody loves a baby, and Archie is a poppet, as well as being Harry’s absolute double.He has a sunny disposition and is obviously adored by his besotted mum and dad. The wee chap looked delighted to be on his first proper outing as a member of the royal firm.And Meghan is in her element. She appeared happy, relaxed and has managed to get her “look” just right.There were no designer frocks nor ostentatious jewellery. Instead it was all sustainable dresses, High Street shoes and lots of recycled outfits.Harry and Meghan have both shone a light on some hugely deserving causes and charities close to their hearts.They work well together, as well as being effective on their own, and it’s refreshing to hear them speak to the media like normal people, instead of the usual dry, formal speeches.It is in places such as Africa that they can both do such a lot of good and build on the pioneering charity work carried out by Harry’s late mum Princess Diana.Meghan telling young South African girls she is a woman of colour who feels like their sister means they can truly relate to her. The words were inspired and from the heart.There are rumours that in the future Harry, Meghan and Archie would spend half the year in southern Africa, and I reckon it’s a good idea.I’ve been lucky enough to visit this incredible part all of the world and it grabs you by the heart and doesn’t let go.Like Harry, I share a particular love of beautul Botswana, and would be delighted for themthey were lucky enough to set up a home from home there.They would be under much less pressure and scrutiny than here in the UK and able to lead almost normal lives should they so wish.Meanwhile Harry, Meghan – and especially Archie – continue with the charm offensive, breaking down barriers and becoming a force to be reckoned with.Diana would be very proud.Recycle your clothes instead of having wardrobes stuffed with cheap fashion.Stop buying plastic-wrapped fast food and maybe think about turning the bloody lights off when you leave a room.Just a thought . . .I HONESTLY think we are in imminent danger of completely losing our sense of humour and turning into a nation of po-faced bores.I couldn’t believe the reaction I got when I cheekily asked smouldering actor Jason Isaacshe was wearing shorts in an upcoming charity run for Great Ormond Street Hospital, and that I would happily run behind him for the view.It was a cheeky remark made to a delightfully naughty man, who I have interviewed many times.I knew he wouldn’t be offended in the least but would laugh heartily, which is exactly what happened. I also thought it was a fun way to promote a terric cause.I was astonished to be labelled “sexist” and “inappropriate”, which is completely OTT for such innocuous remarks.People really need to get things into perspective.Dan has brought us some of the top names in TV, movies and music, covered all the big award ceremonies and always delivers the most entertaining gossip.Here’s to the next decade of scoops, scandals and showbiz shenanigans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How dare you ”Right, well in the immortal words of Samuel L Jackson: “Allow me to retort.”How dare we  No. How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.I’m sorry Ms Thunberg, butyou’re going to lay into my generation, you must accept it when I lay into you and yours.What about the pills you take when you have a headache What about the clean water that comes out of your tap  What about the food you can buy at any time of the day and night No -year-old was responsible for any of that.What about the aid missions currently being run in some of the poorest countries of the world, or the drugs that help keep Aids at bay Think about all the movies you’ve enjoyed. Movies made by grown-ups. And all those comedians who’ve made you laugh.And then pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden’s fighter planes. To keep you safe.We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all.So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.And yes, you are spoilt because when you told your mum and dad to stop using planes and give up meat, they didn’t behave like sane parents and ignore you. They actually said, “Yes, dear.” And did.What they should have done is point out that le is tragic.Some people are born bright and some are born stupid.Some are beautul and some are not.Some have rich parents who give them everything but love.Some have poor parents who have nothing to give except love.Now shut up and let them get on with it.This is how the world works. It’s how the world has always worked.And banging your fists on the table won’t change a thing. You’ll learn that when you’ve got a few more years under your belt.I agree with you that the world is heating up. You may even be right that man has something to do with it.And there is no doubt that as deserts eat into currently habitable places in Africa and the Middle East, Europe will face an unimaginable refugee crisis.Something needs to be done about that. So how’s this for an idea. Get back to school as quickly as possible and work hard in your science lectures.Because science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes.Many thousands of people who you had the temerity to blame this week are trying to do exactly what you want.So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it.And no. You cannot stay out past ten. And you cannot go out in a skirt that short.And the best business brains don’t come cheap.SAM Smith, who’s a singer I think, announced recently that “he” doesn’t consider “himself” to be a man or a woman and wants everyone to refer to “him” as “they” in future.They said on Instagram that they have been at war with themselves for . . . oh, I give up. It’s too dficult.It’s also dficult for the organisers of the Brit Awards, who are now having to work out whether there should be separate awards in future for men and women.Because what happensMr and or Mrs Smith wins one As non-binary people continue to increase the noise they make about their non-binariness, this is going to be a problem everywhere.It can’t be long before the right-on Oscar people have to address the issue.I bet they already have with the lavatories.And after that, there will be Wimbledon and football, where there will have to be a new league for people who aren’t men OR women.Or they will have to let women and the neither nors into the Premier League  Probably not such a bad idea at Spurs these days.Right. I see.So,the speech had been delivered by someone who began by saying: “I’m here with you as a father, a husband, a man and your brother”, would that have made what followed less important EVER since I was a small boy, people have been claiming to be on the verge of inventing a new plane which will get to Australia in time for tea.We’ve had ramjets and scramjets and rockets and all we’ve ever really seen in the flesh is Concorde, which could only carry enough fuel to reach New York, and the SR- Blackbird which could only carry one passenger.Now, though, a British company has announced the Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine – Sabre – which they say will enable a passenger plane to get from London to Oz, via space, in four hours.That’s fantastic, of course, and I wish them well.But the truth is that the world doesn’t really need fast aircraft any more.The Blackbird spy plane was replaced by satellites, and Concorde was replaced by something that can get businessmen across the Atlantic in no time at all.It’s called the internet.But the trip had to be cancelled because . . . it was too windy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One much-trumpeted injection of funds was only enough for , a year, a fraction of the increase needed.We said only a bonfire of planning restrictions would do.And Mr Javid is promising just that, for new builds and extensions.He must also face down NIMBY neighbours and stop developers hoarding plots or releasing homes at a snail’s pace to keep prices high.We look forward to the detail . . . and hope it is not over-hyped, as so much was under Theresa May.Real change could bring homes in London and the South East within millennial buyers’ reach for the first time.Go for it, The Saj.GIVING Jeremy Corbyn power even for one ­second would harm Britain for a generation — and here’s why:To job-creating firms and foreign investors, we are a safe haven.Corbyn believes in none of that.

Labour would hammer businesses and seize private property.Remainer MPs seem tempted to install him in No “temporarily”.

They will merrily help Corbyn for another independence vote.All other sane MPs must halt this lunacy.“BETRAYAL” is a word with no place in our politics, preaches holier-than-thou John Major, who used exactly that word as PM.MPs must soften their language, insists Major, who branded three Eurosceptic Tory ministers “bastards”.“Political chicanery” must not be used to take us out of the EU with No Deal, rules Major — who once swerved a scandal using his own chicanery and now backs any and all tricks to stop Brexit.Once PM.

Beyonce has been involved in a trade-mark dispute for years against Wendy Morales, whose wedding planning business goes by the same name.Beyonce is outraged at the idea that Blue Ivy Carter, “the daughter of two of the most famous performers in the world”, might be confused with a boutique wedding event planning business.Which is unlikely, when you really think about it.So you might wonder why — really — Beyonce gives a flying fig about the fact that it has the same name as her daughter.But I guess — unless you are the mother of a cultural icon — it’s hard for mere mortals like us to understand.Beyonce has accused Morales of riding her coattails. Who knows, maybe she is. But so what What seems more relevant is the degree to which these parents apparently view their daughter as an extension of themselves.They care more about their fame and reputation than they do about letting Blue Ivy forge her own path, find her own identity and be herself.Yes, we all pass on our values and, to a degree, our aspirations to our children.But we all owe it to our kids to be aware of where we stop and they begin.And it seems to me that Beyonce and Jay Z are robbing their daughter of her childhood and suffocating her with their own aspirations.We only have to take one look around at those who haven’t been allowed proper childhoods — Michael Jackson, Macaulay Culkin, Aaron Carter — to see how badly things can go wrong.Forget designer clothes and cultural icon status, the best thing Blue Ivy’s parents could give her is a proper childhood.We all think our kids are special. Most of us do our best NOT to spoil our kids and keep them grounded, they seem to want the opposite.They need to teach her that money and status is not as important as family, values, morals, kindness — and friends. THIS week I am mainly feeling fed up with politicians.I voted Remain because the chaos of leaving far outweighed any problems of staying in.But the country voted Leave and I accepted that. What’s the point in asking the country to votethe result is ignored Three years on and we are still waiting to leave. Boris Johnson is at least trying to honour the people’s decision.Jo Swinson for the Lib Debs, who is held up as a shining new light in politics, has said thather party wins an election – most unlikely – she will cancel Brexit on the basis that on the first vote the margin for Leave was so small and people didn’t know what they were voting for.But those are just excuses. She, and others, think they know best and would no doubt keep having the vote until they get the result they want – to remain in Europe.Politicians are trying to force a Remain outcome, through delays to Brexit, not calling a general election and following their own views on the EU rather than that of the country.But crashing out without a deal is not what really worries me. It’s the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn government.Here is a man who sympathises with Russia – although they came here and killed people, including poisoning a police officer.A man who sympathises with the IRA, met with Hamas and Hezbollah and refused to sing the National Anthem.A man who wants to close private schools and implement a four-day week .This is a man who wants to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for private tenants and force landlords to sell their buy-to-rent properties for less than they are worth, leaving them in debt – then also clobber them with higher taxes.He wants to nationalise industry and confiscate £billion of shares in , large companies and hand them to workers.As Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money.I hope politicians knock their heads together, compromise, get out of Europe and focus on the future outside of the EU – new trade deals, new investments, jobs and innovation.This is a great country, let’s hope it remains so.I KNOW Phoebe Waller- Bridge is not for everyone – although her telly show Fleabag is pretty damned funny.But whether you like her or not, she is currently on a serious roll.TV awards left, right and centre including Emmys and Baftas – and now she has just signed a £million deal with Amazon.Her talent is incredible.IN her new memoirs, Demi Moore has criticised ex-husband Ashton Kutcher for “shaming” her by sharing a picture of her in her underwear during their marriage.Apparently, he justied it at the time by saying that sharing a snap of Demi half-naked was just a “good-natured joke”.Really ACTOR Christopher Eccleston has revealed his lelong battle with anorexia – which some, who think of it as a woman’s affliction, may have found shocking.Meanwhile, F’s Lewis Hamilton has revealed he’s not happy with his body and has clearly spent his letime trying to become so.Both stories are reminders that men are becoming as fixated with their physiques as women have been all these years.What we are left with is a reality that no one – man or woman – is ever -per-cent happy with their looks.I most certainly am not.THIS Wednesday sees theof The Apprentice at pm on BBC .The show starts with a bang when Lord Sugar sends candidates off to South Africa to run a safari tour.When they don’t know the dference between an elephant and a rhino, you know it spells disaster . . .  but in a good way.This series is the best ever, so I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as we did making it.Freddy McConnell, , from Kent, wants to be registered as “father” or “parent”, despite having physically given birth to the baby – but a judge ruled against him.This is tricky, but the judge’s decision has to be the right one. Despite the wonders of modern science, men cannot, yet, give birth.That’s a fact.He was physically a woman when he gave birth and, although he may be legally male now, that’s another issue.WHATEVER Christie Brinkley is doing, she looks fantastic for .As she posed in a denim jumpsuit, looking decades younger she left me thinking I would love to know what she’s had done – as I would certainly do it.She obviously eats well and exercises – but she has also had surgery, which she is very honest about.Others have had it and look strange, but Christie looks fresh and youthful. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They could end up re-shaping the political landscape of this country forever.The Supreme Court’s outlawing of a political decision and the coward Corbyn’s refusal to trigger a general election have created a dangerous Commons stalemate.At the same time voters are powerless as political conventions which are the backbone of our democracy are reshaped before their eyes.Tuesday’s court judgement overruling Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament will have a chilling effect on decision-making at the heart of government.How many future kne-edge rulings made by a PM against the clock could now be quashed by the court What about the signing of treaties  Or the appointment of ministers How about choosing to take military action in retaliation for an attack on Britain You can bet Vladimir Putin is lapping up the prospect of a British Prime Minister having to go cap in hand to a  of judges to askhe can hit back.The Supreme Court has potentially paved the way to a new era of rule by a group of unelected entities. Meanwhile, the Leader of Her Majesty’s Opposition has shown once again that he has the spine of a jellyfish.Jeremy Corbyn’s actions are those of a man who is scared to face the voters, scared of his own Labour MPs and scared of even being PM.Together with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson he is intent on driving Britain away from the Brexit a majority voted for and into a rigged referendum which nobody deserves.They are also forcing us away from the general election which the country is crying out for and into another EU extension which will only prolong our agony.This week the SNP are leading a plot to ambush Boris with a vote of no confidence while he prepares to address the Tory conference.Perhaps they should consider how Scottish voters would feelthey had won an independence vote only to find it hadn’t been implemented three years later.Our shambling farce has gone on too long.But as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox says even these turkeys won’t be able to prevent Christmas.Britain’s voters will get their say eventually.At that moment they will decide one of two very clear futures for this country.Either a resumption of the democratic traditions and institutions at the heart of our society under Boris Johnson.Or a disunited kingdom, riven by the elite interests of lawyers and rival factions, carving up our political landscape between them.It would mean goodbye to the Britain we treasure as a beacon of democracy.And herald the dawn of a chaotic virtual republic under complete enslavement to Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The package of measures will “end low pay altogether”, he said.He also told the Tory faithful: “The hard work of the British people really is paying off.“It’s clear it’s the Conservatives who are the real party of labour. We are the workers’ party.”But businesses baulked because of the extra costs for them. And Treasury aides would not deny last night that the moves may hike employers’ wage bills by £billion.In a jam-packed speech, Mr Javid also outlined his plan to roll out new bus networks and bring back scrapped routes. And he:Mr Javid’s low-pay action means minimum-wage workers will be paid p an hour more than they were expecting by . Before his intervention, the wage was forecast to be £. an hour within five years.The move is also a key general election move to try to see off Labour’s promise of raising the minimum wage to £ immediately.A source close to the Chancellor said: “We’ve got a battle with Labour in this space, we need to own it.”An aide to Mr Javid — who is the son of a bus driver who came from humble roots — added: “This is a personal issue for Sajid, he knows what low pay looks like.”Campaigners welcomed the moves. Resolution Foundation think tank boss Torsten Bell said it “will take UK to top of the minimum wage league”.But business chiefs warned it would run the risk of putting small firms out of business.UKHospitality, which represents businesses employing service-industry workers, dubbed it “a double whammy of a further unprecedented cost increase”.And the Federation of Small Businesses’ national chairman Mike Cherry called on Mr Javid to institute “more support to help small employers” meet his ambition.The Chancellor also tore into Labour, delighting the Manchester audience, which included the PM’s special advisor Dominic Cummings.Even he has excelled himself by ­promoting a famously debunked conspiracy theory about Brexit.Remainer Hammond seriously claims Boris Johnson is “backed by speculators who have bet billions on a hard Brexit”. This smear has zero evidence. Remain-backing City experts and even former ­Labour advisers say it makes no sense.Not only that, but Boris badly wants a deal. No Deal is just the fallback.This goes beyond Hammond’s usual rubbish. Here is a former statesman so deranged by Brexit that he will use baseless fiction to tarnish the leader of the party he represented for decades.In July he was running the nation’s finances. Now he is a broken backbencher, with no party, in a tinfoil hat.His successor is very dferent.Sajid Javid’s surprise announcement of a thumping rise to the Living Wage will be great news for four million low-paid workers, many of them Sun readers.With the age threshold lowered from  to , it’s a bonus for millennials too.Firms will fret about extra costs. That’s a minor worry next to the nightmarish burdens of a Corbyn Government. If anything we’d bring the rise in faster.The Sun urged Boris to pick a dynamic Chancellor after three years of Hammond. And Saj is off to a flier.Mr Javid mocked Jeremy Corbyn over his confusing flip-flopping on leaving the EU. Playing with the Labour logo, he dubbed him “a man with many Brexit positions, not the few”.Mr Javid also insisted he and his next-door neighbour Boris Johnson were “partners” with a very close working relationship — despite rumours of tensions between them.And the Chancellor delivered an impassioned plea on the need to deliver Brexit.While conceding No Deal had risks, he said: “The most reckless course of all would be to not deliver Brexit at all.“If we fail to deliver on the instruction of the British people, we are in danger of tearing the very fabric of our democracy.A fabric that has been carefully woven together over centuries. Andwe do that, I fear we may not be able to stitch it up again.“If people are going to have faith in the ballot box, we absolutely have to follow through on that vote.”Tomorrow the conference will hear from Home Secretary Priti Patel as she vows to restore the Tories’ battered reputation on law and order.She will tell voters that the Government has listened to their worries about the bloodshed on Britain’s streets.And she will declare: “To the police service — we back you. And to the criminals I simply say this — we are coming after you.”Her speech comes just days after she announced plans to hand Taser guns to , more cops.Separately last night, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland unveiled plans to axe automatic early release for serious violent criminals and sexual offenders.Instead of being let out halfway through their sentences, they will now have to spend at least two-thirds of it behind bars.The new proposals mean a rapist sentenced to  years will have to serve . years instead of seven.The Chancellor asked his mum Zubaida: “Did you ever think we’d be here  Do you remember Dad’s first shop used to be just down the road ”Rochdale-born Mr Javid added: “Mum thought it was a big deal when she watched the first Asians move into Coronation Street, here in Manchester.“Well, now she’s watched as the first Asians move into Downing Street.”Mr Javid also teased Downing Street neighbour Boris Johnson. He said: “We share the same vision of One Nation conservatism and we spend the same amount of time brushing our hair.”Mr Buckland said: “We’re going to restore faith in the sentencing system. We believe release should be earned. We owe it to the victims.”It wouldn’t cover murderers, as they already have to serve their whole tarf before going in front of the Parole Board.Boris Johnson has already vowed to hire , more police officers and ensure child killers get “le” terms.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and serve the people as a formation of fighter jets trailing coloured smoke swooped low over the capital.Speculation was re as to what weapons would be unveiled, with parade rehearsals showing missiles and aircraft under camouflage wraps.One of the most closely-watched weapons unveiled on Tuesday was the Dongfeng-, a nuclear-capable glider that foreign analysts say is designed to manoeuvre at high speed to evade anti-missile defences.The Chinese government is keen to assert its dominance in Asia and particularly in the South China Sea where it has been busy building militarised islands in international waters.And its clear message to the US is that it is getting closer than ever to matching it in terms of military might.A defence ministry spokesman recently said Beijing had no intention to flex its muscles but was instead keen to show a peace-loving and responsible China.But, President Xi Jinping warned at the event: No force can shake the status of our great motherland, and no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation.The major ceremony was held to mark the day that Mao Zedong pronounced the founding of the Peoples Republic of China on October ,  from the imposing Tiananmen Gate.China’s Communist Party celebrated its th anniversary in power with a military parade.Showcasing its most advanced weapons, those revealed for the first time included hypersonic-glide missiles that experts say could be dficult for the US to counter.The Peoples Liberation Army , the worlds biggest military with two million men and women in unorm, will be able to access a dizzying array of new weapons, such as:State media said % of the arms shown in the parade were appearing in public for the first time.This hardware included new and revamped versions of missiles, such as the long-range submarine-launched and ship-based YJ-A anti-ship cruise missiles.China only displays systems it says have entered some form of service, though analysts believe some of the new equipment could be experimental or prototypes.For example, the Gongji-, described as an attack drone and the final version of the Sharp Sword drone that first flew in , was displayed for the first time on the back of a truck.China showed jets in aerial refuelling formation, and the Z- medium lt helicopter - similar to a US UH- Black Hawk - also made its public debut.China has about  nuclear warheads, compared with , for America and , for Russia, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .The military showed off Chinas most advanced weapons, some being shown for the first time, as rows of soldiers marched in lockstep past President Xi Jinping and other leaders in Tiananmen Square, the countrys symbolic political heart.Thousands of spectators waved Chinese flags and fighter jets flew low overhead.The partys emphasis on missiles and other long-range weapons reflects Beijings desire to displace the United States as the regions dominant force and enforce claims to Taiwan, the South China Sea and other disputed territories.The high-profile parade included , troops, more than  aircraft and  pieces of military equipment, according to Ministry of Defence spokesman Major General Cai Zhijun.A supersonic drone, hypersonic missile and a robot submarine were also shown off.But all eyes were primed for whether the huge Dongfeng missile would roll through Tiananmen Square in its debut public appearance.Many new weapons “will be shown for the first time,” Cai told reporters last week. Asked whether that would include the DF-, Cai said, “Please wait and see.”No details of the DF- have been released, but the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said it may have the world’s longest range at , kilometres.US nuclear tipped missiles fall a few thousand kilometres short of that.Analysts say the DF-, flying at  times the speed of sound, might be able to reach the US in  minutes with up to  warheads for separate targets.China’s current mainstay missile the Dongfeng- — Dongfeng means “east wind” — has a range of more than , kilometres that puts most of the continental US within reach.Todays carefully coordinated celebrations in China came as a protester was shot in the chest by police in Hong Kong, where violent demonstrations continued against the regime.Tensions remained high today as cops banned rallies in Hong Kong, in fear of chaos on Chinas National Day.Tens of thousands of black-clad protesters marched in multiple pro-democracy rallies, urging Chinas Communist Party topower to the people.In a bid to stop demonstrations, riot police repeatedly fired tear gas in several areas as protesters hurled gasoline bombs, bricks and other objects in their direction.Video footage showed a campaigner - a man struck by a live round - begging for help as he bled on the street.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nearly  rangers were gunned down by poachers between  and .Local poachers hunt wildle - like leopards, lions or monkeys - then deliver carcasses to ‘fronts’ owned by international crime syndicates and with links to Jihadis.Rhino horn can be more valuable on the black markets than cocaine or heroin, making the exotic animal trade the fourth most lucrative illegal activity in the world behind drugs, arms and human trafficking.Malawis poverty and corruption has made it South Africas number one trafficking route for ivory trafficking.Yet, despite massive efforts and UK funds being pumped in, no foreign national has been convicted in Malawi.From the killing fields of Zambia and Mozambique to the traffickers streaming through Malawi, we lt the lid on the illegal wildle trade which remains one of the most brutal industries in the world...The huge sums of money at stake have made poaching a lucrative trade for criminal organisations and terrorist groups.Poachers linked to the Jihadi group Boko Haram are believed to have slaughtered , forest elephants in a single region of Gabon over  years – leading to the deployment of British troops to the region in .Shocking images of a mutilated elephant corpse show sick poachers often cut the animals head in half to remove its tusks.Other elephants and lions have ended up maimed by metal traps laid out by poachers.Lions have become a target recently because so many rhinos have been wiped out and the big cats are easier to poach because they scavenge which means poachers can poison them with meat before hacking off their faces and paws.“If you take out the word wildle and think about it in terms of crime and its value to a country, these resources – be it for tourism or whatever – are being lost,” says Mary Rice, executive director of the Environmental Investigation Agency.“It’s a hugely serious criminal activity and it’s highly likely that some of these iniduals are involved in other trades, like firearms and money laundering. It’s all interlinked.”As well as being barbaric, the poaching trade is forcing many species towards extinction.Over the last  years the global number of black rhinos has dropped from , to ,, while the African Rhino could disappear by .Scaly anteaters called Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammal because of their hides and meat, and are particularly vulnerable as they curl into a ball when threatened.Over the last  years alone a million have been taken from the wild - in another  they could be completely gone.After the animals have been murdered, their hides and bones are cut into small bits, put in containers and moved through neighbouring countries where border police have been paid off. This is known as ‘owning the road’.Eventually, they make their way across continents to Asia, where there is a high demand in countries like China and Vietnam for ivory goods, furs and ornaments. Ivory is even ground into a powder then sold as Chinese medicine.Harry, Prince William and Prince Charles led an international wildle conference in  to highlight the problem of poaching, with Charles warning there wasnt a moment to lose when it came to protecting endangered animals.It led to the total ban on trading ivory in the UK - regardless of its age - last year, while in Malawi the government also toughened up laws.Five years ago, the average punishment for poaching in Malawi was a £ fine – in  it was a five-year jail term.The country has also pumped money into new investigation units, in part thank to UK funding, leading it to become the ‘golden child’ of the conservation world.Javier Montano, from the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, says a multi-agency approach is critical.Wildle trafficking needs to be treated as a serious crime, he says. “We hope that Malawi’s strong efforts in addressing and combating illegal wildle trade to date are reflected in the courtrooms in the coming months.”And it seems that might be the sticking point.Malawi has been linked to record hauls in Singapore, China and Australia, but is yet to convict a single foreign national caught trafficking.In contrast, neighbouring Tanzania jailed four Chinese smugglers for  years for rhino smuggling.“What we’re seeing is they track down these syndicates and networks and they use the full force of the law to arrest them,” says Rice.“But then corruption creeps in. We see some of these iniduals who should be receiving strict sentences being let off with lenient penalties.Tens of thousands of elephants are being killed every year for their ivory tusks.The ivory is often carved into ornaments and jewellery – China is the biggest consumer market for such products.The ban on international trade was introduced in  by CITESafter years of unprecedented poaching.In the s, an estimated , elephants were being killed per year and up to % of herds were lost in some regions.The ban allowed some populations to recover, especially where elephants were adequately protected.But there has been an upsurge in poaching and illegal ivory trafficking in recent years, driven by increasing demand in Asia, which has led to steep declines in forest elephant numbers and some savannah elephant populations.Insufficient anti-poaching capacity, weak law enforcement and corruption undermine efforts to stop the poaching and trafficking in some countries.Source: WWFIts hoped this could change as the country awaits the sentencing of an alleged wildle trafficking ring led by notorious ivory kingpin Yun Hua Lin, .Ten Chinese Nationals and four people from Malawai have been charged with possessing rhino horn, ivory, pangolin, hippo teeth and firearms.We have capacity issues, but so far Malawi is becoming a safe home for wildle, Brighton Kumchedwa, director of the Department of National Parks.These arrests are now sending a strong message that we are no longer a playground for wildle trafficking.Rice agrees that country has in many ways become a success story, but warns nothing can be taken for granted.I think they still need that eye on the country to help the government, prosecutions and NGOs to help get beyond the corrupt elements, she explains.“So it’s a really good opportunity with Prince Harry visiting.He’s done a lot to help raise the profile in the country but it’s still really grappling with the problem.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly .

But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture.

The defendant was with a friend.Ciara Jones and Nicole Deadfield were sat together waiting for the train when they accidentally bumped into the defendant who started shouting at ‘do not f***ing bump into me.”Ms Lauchlan said that the victim had told the Ms Peereboom to put a stop to the argument as they all made their way onto the train but as it pulled into Reading station she allegedly launched an attack.The prosecutor said: As Ms Jones stood up she felt her hair pulled with enough force to pull her into a seat.“As people tried to get the defendant off her, the other victim had her hair pulled and received an injury to her ankle.”Gabriella Marabet, , who was a student at the time, said: I had drunk around a bottle of Prosecco and three gin and tonics at the Newbury races with my family and friends but I was tired after a long day of dancing and chatting and slept on the train ride to Reading station where we were set to change for Oxford.I went to swerve around a commotion in the alley when my hair was violently pulled forwards from the chair.

I screamed and was escorted off the train and she was kept on it.The jury of nine women and three men was shown body-worn camera police footage of Ms Marabet and her family and friends on the  shouting after the incident.Ms Marabet said: I was furious, I was shouting that I had been bitten but I did not feel that it was dealt with accordingly by police officers at the time.When asked by defence counsel Kate Parker whether this commotion was the act of a sober person, the victim defended her actions blaming her anger and emotion on being upset that police treated her and her party as the culprit despite telling them she was the victim.Ms Lauchlan said: Ultimately, Gabriella Marabet was put in handcuffs and so was her step-brother and her party was warned they might be arrested. However, they were just detained until they calmed down.The jury was shown pictures taken by Ms Marabet of her bite injury the day after the incident.She said: I had a bite mark and a sore head from where my hair was pulled.

I drove past where they were closing off the road because of the accident, just a mile from my house. I could see a lot of rescue vehicles. I knew at that point that my beautul son was either very badly injured, or dead. Louis died instantly when the car collided with a huge tree at a speed estimated to be -mph.

She signed up to Slimming World and, in  months, has lost more than  stone. The mother, of Tavistock, Devon, was told she could still eat all the food she loved, including chicken nuggets, and the weight started to drop off. Mandy realised the meal plan could easily be adapted to suit family le and she could eat everything from pizza, roast dinners, curry and even chicken nuggets and chips.    With the hundreds of free foods available it really can be adapted to any lestyle, the diabetes research nurse said. It really is so easy to follow as itaposs not a diet it is a well balanced healthy eating plan that encourages long term intrinsic lestyle changes. The best bit about Slimming World is nothing is banned. If I want to enjoy an ice cream on my day out with my little boy then I can. Slowly I kept swapping my food choices and increasing my physical activity and before I knew it I had easily embraced a whole new lestyle. My confidence was slowly building and I went from wanting to hide behind baggy clothes and  smiles to genuine happiness and clothes that showed off my new forming figure.    Mandy, who now weighs . stone, had struggled with her size since childhood. I was a chubby child and on the larger side as a teenager, she told Okehampton Times . As an emotional eater food has literally been my crutch and one that I have relied on heavily. As a teenager, I was subjected to bullying because of my weight and this only served to fuel my emotional eating and the weight slowly kept creeping on. Despite trying everything from hypnotherapy to diet pills, and milkshakes to restrictive diet plans, the mum found it tough to tackle the flab. She also had a setback when her husband was diagnosed with incurable kidney cancer. He was forced to have surgery to have his kidney removed, along with a separate operation for a hernia repair. And despite the pain of seeing her husband going through such a horric ordeal, her group managed to keep her on track with her diet.

I always was involved in sports and believe our body is the temple where our soul resides, so I had been for years studying and practising better and more effective ways to reach that goal. My lestyle always had been healthy but has been improving by knowledge and experience and also by observation of my clientsapos results.  I teach with my knowledge and by example that the statement aposage is just a numberapos is trueyou have the right care in your lestyle and with positive thoughts. I keep a balance in my active training and recovery time. Before I used to think by doing cardio was more than enough to keep my body healthy, but injuries and studying dferent formats taught me that our muscles have dferent abilities and motions. There is not a specic fitness format that can cover all of them. The same format can develop overuse injuries or fractures. I also learned how with age it was important to develop our muscles to prevent osteoporosis and keep hormonal balance by keeping active workouts with recovery workouts.  Good posture and mobility play an important part of our energy level and ability to rid us of toxins in the body. Balance in your nutrients is a very important part of overall, but with a positive mind, all of these components combine to create a healthy body. I can manage better normal stress in le and use my energy to do more things that I need to do, but also what I love to do. I can still do activities that most people of my age canapost and enjoy le doing things with my loved ones. I have to admit that today I need to take care more about what to eat than before, otherwise I can gain weight easier.  You are what you eat, so I avoid the most that I can processed food and sugar. Mostly I eat raw and organic and avoid putting chemicals in my body. I try to avoid medication. I prefer to use herbs, natural remedies or homeopathy than any other medication. Our bodies have amazing power to heal. Alejandra, who also has four grandchildren says that her lestyle has helped her keep up with them and join in fun activities. Since becoming a Pilates instructor, she has received many compliments on her appearance and people often mistake her for being her daughteraposs sister.  I feel healthier in general and smarter than I did in my twenties and thirties. Iaposve even learned to stay away from toxic people or situations that drain my energy. When you do that, the right people appear in your le, she said.Men are really surprised when they see me. Whenever I teach classes or Iaposm in dferent places, guys will give me compliments. Even on social media, I receive complements about how I look on Instagram .A couple of times Iaposve received flowers from strangers Iaposm married so I right away say my status. Many times, people think my daughter and I are sisters. Start changing one bad habit for a good one at time. If for some reason you fall, be nice with you. Start over and be more aware.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day.

The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position.

power to extend the Borders Railway.And doubts have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area. However, it must be stressed thata patient needs to see a healthcare professional urgently, then they will do.ldquoWe appreciate that change in the way services are provided can take a period of time to settle in however, we know from patient feedback that we are getting it right, and this is reflected by the fact that we have received complaints from only . per cent of patients this year.ldquoWe know that the signicant majority of our patients have a positive experience of healthcare through Riverside."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-full-praise-ridge-visit","story":"Aileen Campbell MSP, cabinet secretary for communities and local government, paid a visit to the town.She was met by staff and volunteers from The Ridge, who spoke about their work at the Backlands Garden site.Volunteers also spoke about how The Ridge and its services had impacted on their lives.Ms Campbell was also impressed by the work being carried out by the Ridge Foundations team, who are currently restoring the Black Bull Close buildings that sit at the head of the gardens.Until recently, the buildings had lain in ruins, in real danger of being lost forever.While under restoration and looking forward to a more useful future, the buildings now act as a training environment for the Ridge Foundations trainees and apprentices, as they learn and hone their new skills in masonry and joinery.The MSP said: ldquoVisiting The Ridge gave me an insight into the wide range of projects and support they provide, including the Backlands site, the Hungry Hatch Cafe and the exciting restoration work at Black Bull Close.ldquoThese projects provide great food, green spaces to enjoy and improve Dunbar as a place to live and visit.ldquoThis innovative enterprise also provides local people with opportunities for training, employment and volunteering and helps improve health and wellbeing.ldquoThe success of The Ridge is a testament to the dedication of staff and volunteers, transforming peoplersquos lives and physically regenerating the heart of Dunbar.A spokeswoman for The Ridge was ldquothrilled to welcome the politician.She added: ldquoAs an organisation, we are deeply embedded within the community and believe passionately that everyone has a really valuable contribution to make.ldquoWe are committed to providing opportunities for people to overcome barriers to achieving their full potential.ldquoMs Campbell could see and understood how the many Ridge offerings provide a holistic environment for those more vulnerable members of our community to thrive."},{"url":null,"title":"project-restoring-historic-tranent-shopfront-former-glory","story":"The Buttercup Dairy company was founded by Edinburgh mogul Andrew Ewing, with the first branch opening in  in Kirkcaldy, and it soon became common all over Scotlandrsquos central belt.The company was famous for its distinctive and extravagant shop fronts and it lasted for  years before its final shop closed down in .Tranentrsquos branch of this iconic dairy was at - High Street, and the intact shop front was discovered by local beauticians Simply Smooth.A grant was given by Regenerate Tranent to repair and restore it to its former glory.Gareth Jones, the architect managing the project, presented a social media video on the progress made by the team.He said that there was some damage from boarding up the shop front for so many years, indicating the drill holes in the tiles however, most of the tile work has survived and the plan is to restore, rather than replace, as much as possible.It is not just the aesthetics that the team will be dealing with ndash work on the roof and chimney will ensure the building is weather proof.Lucy Schofield, Tranent regeneration scheme officer, said: ldquoWersquore really excited and happy with the repair works.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

But the Indyref was never like this. There may have been a deal of bad language and anger on the fringes of the internet, where Yoons and Cybernats clashed by night, but never in parliament.The Commons went slightly mad last week, with hysterical finger pointing, tears and shouting. It was like a class of unruly school-kids in the middle of a sugar rush. Please miss: he called me a liar. No, I didnt. Yes, you did. Well, you started it by calling me a traitor. Miss! Miss! Only there was no one able to control this rowdy collection of over-wrought political egos, least of all the Speaker.So, who did start it  Well, Boris Johnson by deploying his rebarbative, war-time rhetoric. Calling the Benn Act the ldquoSurrender Act. Accusing MPs of being ldquotraitors, ldquobetraying the people. It was demeaning, even for him. But Im not going to apportion blame exclusively to the Prime Minister. Everyone has lost the plot over Brexit ndash not least Labour MPs, who repeatedly accuse Johnson of being a ldquoracistand a ldquotin pot dictator staging a ldquocoup.Why did the Labour MP Paula Sherrf think it wise to invoke the murdered MP, Jo Cox, in this cauldron of bile  It was a crude attempt to link Boris Johnsons ldquosurrender rhetoric, the far right, and a racist murder, ashe were somehow morally responsible. Johnson didnt help by responding that the ldquobest way to honour Jo Cox would be to get Brexit done. That was patently absurd, tasteless and inappropriate.But the reaction was even more hysterical. Youd have thought hed actually called for more MPs to be murdered. The Labour MP Jess Phillips accosted the Prime Minister in the lobby, demanding that he apologise for saying it was \"humbug to claim that his use of ldquoSurrender Act was an incitement to violence. Really  Apologise for using the word ldquohumbug This is how stupid, tangential rows erupt on social media ndash where everyone you disagree with becomes a fascist, and people get drunk on synthetic outrage. They all need to get a grip dial down the rhetoric stop playing to the Twitter gallery.Im tempted to suggest calling Lady Hale, the Spider Woman, along to sort this mess out. The -year-old president of the Supreme Court became an unlikely superhero last week after she unprorogued parliament and ruled that the PM had acted unlawfully. But shes a judge, who lives in the rarefied atmosphere of the Inns of Court, not the Commons bear pit.We dont yet know the full implications of last weeks Supreme Court ruling, except that they will profound. It amounted to, as the former Supreme Court judge, Lord Sumption, put it: ldquoa revolution. This is because the court ruled on whether the government had acted with ldquoreasonable justication in suspending parliament for five weeks. It may sound odd, but no one has expected governments to behave reasonably before.The English High Court had earlier ruled that the courts had no right to get involved in policy, and that was what most people believed. Butjudges are going to get involved in detailed political decision-making, then the Supreme Court will itself become politicised. It already is. There are calls for its judges to be subject to political vetting, as in America.Labour MPs and supporters were jubilant after Lady Hales ruling. But they may not be celebrating when Labour are next in government. They may find courts questioning policies like nationalisation and the abolition of private schools. Radical parties of the Left generally have more to fear from judicial activism than Conservatives. As do nationalists. Look at Catalonia, where politicians really are in jail because the Spanish supreme court ruled an independence referendum illegal. Couldnt happen here  Im beginning to wonder.But thats all for the future. The immediate problem is how this wretched Brexit crisis is to be resolved before real warfare breaks out. We should be thankful, perhaps, that the only punches thrown so far have been verbal ones. We havent yet had any Gilet Jaunes-style civil disobedience and rioting. But the country is on a kne edge and it is the duty of parliament to deal with this crisis, not become part of it.The Prime Minister has a majority of minus , has behaved unlawfully, and is refusing to honour the Benn Act, which requires him to ask for a third extension of Article . Former PM John Major has warned that Mr Johnson might resort to jiggery pokery in the Privy Council to overturn the Benn Act. He is anyway refusing to sign what he calls the ldquosurrender letter to Brussels.The rebel alliance, led by the brilliant SNP MP Joanna Cherry QChave their own solution. Cherry has filed a legal challenge under what is called ldquoNobile Officium ndash a legal device that allows the Court of Session in Edinburgh to sign and send the letter to Brussels on the Prime Ministers behalf.Theres nothing like it in English law. So why would a Scottish court interfere  Well, as it happens, rulings of Scottish courts apply across the entire UK, as a consequence of the Act of Union. The Government could appeal, of course, and the matter could end up back in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale is no doubt sharpening her quill pen as we speak.Nobile Officium is ingenious, but it would surely be all Dominic Cum-mings Christmases coming at once. The idea of Scottish judges signing away British sovereignty, as he might put it, and reversing the Brexit referendum, as he would also put it, would be an ideal curtain-raiser for a General Election. The people versus the Establishment.It would also get Boris Johnson off the hook of having to actually sign the ldquosurrender missive. Instead, he might just make clear to the European Union, that he will not cooperate. He will not appoint a British EU Commissioner, will not discuss the financial implications, will empty-chair summits. Parliament can force Boris Johnson to ask for an extension, but it cant force him to do so in good faith.MPs have one obvious solution: which is to get rid of him by a vote of No Confidence. Put this zombie administration out of its misery. This wouldnt mean that Boris gets to call his early General Election, as many people seem to believe. The Commons has  days to chose a caretaker administration, and negotiate the extension themselves. But MPs cant seem to agree even on this.It is partly because the parties are hopelessly ided over Brexit ndash having voted against Mays deal, a referendum, or revoking A, the lot. But they must take back control,they want to be sure of avoiding a No Deal Brexit. Judges cant do it. Parliament cant do it. Only a government can conduct negotiations with foreign powers. MPs have the power to replace Boris Johnson tomorrow.

It is dficult to see why. A time limit on the interview might have been part of the deal with Downing Street, but the beauty of a live programme is that things can changeneed be. Marrs interview with Boris Johnson was just reaching a critical juncture when the show segued to a pre-recorded interview with Dame Helen Mirren about Catherine the Great .Granted, viewers might have been looking forward to hearing from Dame Helen, but the segment could have been included in a longer version of the programme placed on iPlayer. Yes, the PMrsquos minders would likely have moanedthe interview overran, and it is not quite cricket to go back on an arrangement, yet as we are being constantly told, we are living in extraordinary times.As for the interview with Angela Rayner, Shadow Education Secretary, it could be justied by way of reaction to the Johnson interview. Couple of questions, job done. But we had her response, plus a rehash of last weekrsquos Labour conference story about public schools in England, and yet more speculation on what might happen next on Brexit.Was this a case of the BBC playing it safe when a commercial broadcaster might have gone for it with the Johnson interview and had the arguments later : PM says he acted with proprietyJust as these are unusual times, so Mr Johnson is an exceptional interviewee. That was made plain once more during his encounter with Marr. It was asthe BBC man was equipped with a water pistol, delivering questions in short, sharp, well-aimed bursts, and Mr Johnson was countering with one of those water cannons he bought as London Mayor and was banned from using by the then Home Secretary Theresa May. ldquoWhoosh! went a torrent of metaphor and hyperbole in Marrrsquos direction.It is a dficult style to combat. Interviewing Mr Johnson on the Today programme, Mishal Husain resorted to telling him to ldquoPlease stop talking, which he laughed at and carried on. Eddie Mair managed to get further than most by being icily forensic and not allowing himself to be distracted by the Johnson bluster. Marr did a heroic job of hauling the PM back to the topic on the many occasions he tried to break free, but even this was not enough to halt the tide of verbosity.The most newsworthy moment came towards the end of the encounter when talk turned to Mr Johnsonrsquos friendship with American businesswoman, Jenner Arcuri. The subject had been raised during the paper review. ldquoA lot of people are wonderingwe are going to talk about the Jenner Arcuri affair, said Marr during the item. ldquoYes, we are. They had to, given it was the splash in the Sunday Times. Plus, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had criticised the show for not tackling a Minister about the story last week, when it broke.: Facing court again over extensionThis time, Marr asked several times whether Mr Johnson, as London mayor, had declared any links to Ms Arcuri given her business was in receipt of public money and she had gone on publicly funded trade missions. ldquoThere was no interest to declare, said the PM.Over on Ridge on Sunday, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, adopted a similar, nothing to see here, approach to the Arcuri story, saying that everything went through the proper processes.Next up was Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, whose party had taken out a double page ad in a Sunday newspaper proposing an electoral pact with the Conservatives as a way to give Mr Johnson ldquoa big, workable majority. The PM later brushed aside the offer.Host Sophy Ridge tackled Mr Farage on a recent speech in which he said ldquowersquoll take the kne to overpaid pen pushers in Whitehall who had tried to frustrate Brexit. ldquoIt would have been better to say axe, he conceded, claiming such language was are more in keeping with political tradition.If Mr Farage was now the vocabulary police to Mr Hancockrsquos traffic cop, it has hard to know what role Jackson Carlaw was playing on Sunday Politics Scotland. In the face of questioning by host Gordon Brewer, the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives was like the office temp who had unwisely picked up a ringing phone as he was passing. No, he had not been consulted by London over new EU proposals. Nor was he going to be drawn on whether the PM would have to resignhe did not obey the law and seek a Brexit extension, as one of his own MSPs, Adam Tomkins, insisted earlier this month. Nothing had anything to do with Mr Carlaw, but he would take a message and make sure the right person received it once they ed from lunch.: Hospital building programme highlightedAt least he did not add more intemperate words and heat to what had been a torrid week. On Marr, Helen Mirren said Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, once advised that it was best to praise in a loud voice and scold in a whisper. How wise. It was worth having the grand dame on after all."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6214460.jpg?type=article-full","title":"sajid-javid-plans-national-living-wage-increase-10-50-hour","story":"And he is to lower the age threshold for those who qualy from  to .Sajid Javid said his \"ambitious\" proposal would give four million people a pay rise.The current rate for over s is pound. - but the Living Wage Foundation says it should already be pound across the UK and pound. for those in London.:Four Living Wage accredited Scots colleges named and shamed by union over poverty payLabours shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, called Mr Javids announcement a \"pathetic attempt at catch-up\".Mr Javid said he wanted the national living wage to be raised to match two-thirds of median earnings, which would represent a p hourly increase in  compared to the current system.\"Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether,\" he said.\"To do that, I am setting a new target for the national living wage: raising it to match two-thirds of median earnings.\"That means, on current forecasts, this ambitious plan will bring the national living wage up to pound. - giving four million people a well-earned pay rise.\"But Mr Javid said the Government wanted to reward the hard work of millennials and bring down the age threshold to cover all workers over the age of .But business organisatoins sounded a note of caution about the potential effects of the policy.The chief executiveof the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said there was \"nothing wrong with targeting higher wages\", but \"all of this adds to the cumulative pressures you have seen take their toll on the retail sector\".Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, a charity which represents nurseries, said: \"A rise in the national living wage is fantastic for younger workers, but for the early years sector, this could be an additional cost that many providers will not be able to afford to bear.\"The TUC, meanwhile, said the chancellors promise \"should be taken with a huge bucket of salt\".:Living wage increase is just not enough say Scots poverty campaignersPeople aged  and over will get the national living wage from , while those aged  and over will get it within five years.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, commenting on the living wage plans, said: \"This pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tories-back-spring-election-capitalise-snp-turmoil-following-salmond-trial","story":"The plea to the Prime Minister came as the partyrsquos annual conference in Manchester heard another major spending announcement: a plan to raise the national living wage to pound. an hour by  unveiled by Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, as he sought to move the conference spotlight away from allegations surrounding Mr Johnsons private le.The further sign that an election is on its way has prompted Scottish Tory MPs to urge the PM to rule out a December poll and wait until next year to go to the country, preferably in the spring.:Opposition parties reject SNPs bid for snap no-confidence vote as rt remainsSome party insiders argue that, apart from avoiding the effects of a bad winter in Scotland, holding an election in March  could bring electoral benefits for the Conservatives in their battle with Nicola Sturgeonrsquos SNP following the high-profile Salmond court case.One senior Scottish Tory source told The Herald: ldquoIrrespective of the outcome of the trial, the Nationalists will be in turmoil.In his set-piece speech, Mr Javid told conference that his \"ambitious\" proposal - which as well as a rise in the amount of the living wage would also see the age threshold lowered to cover all workers aged over  - would give four million people a pay rise.He explained he wanted the national living wage to be raised to match two-thirds of median earnings, which would represent a p hourly increase in .\"Over the next five years, we will make the UK one of the first major economies in the world to end low pay altogether,\" declared the Chancellor.But Mr Javid said the Government wanted to reward the hard work of millennials and bring down the age threshold to cover all workers over .But John McDonnell, his Labour Shadow, dismissed the announcement, saying: ldquoThis pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said: ldquoBusiness shares the Chancellors ambition to end low pay.

Word had reached the highest level that there was \"a person with views\" in S. As I walked down a pitch black, -metre-long corridor, I remained steadfastly sure that my wide-ranging research , and in-depth questioningwould see me through this momentary hiccup in creating this seemingly seditious pamphlet .But, in the four minutes it took for the red traffic light at the end of the tunnel of doom, to turn to green, and the Heidiersquos voice to boom ldquoCome!, I wobbled. Yes itrsquos true! I was indeed a dirty socialist interloper sent from a s housing estate state primary school to this small, all-girl, private school to undermine it and ultimately bring about its collapse.When it came to thinking about schools for my own children, surprisingly the simplicity of my survey did not help. I talked to other parents. One friend, who I visited on a sunny April morning at her and her husbandrsquos six-bedroom house, complete with a Porsche  gleaming in the driveway, told me that they were sending their children to the local state school because they felt school was not just about academics.ldquoItrsquos about learning le lessons, coming across a range of people, problems and lsquostuffrsquo so that real le doesnrsquot come as a massive surprise.But then there was another friend of mine in Perth who is an NHS worker. She stridently told me she would rather starve than not have sent her son to private school for the last  years. She herself had been a quiet child who had struggled in a large state primary school and fell behind, before being moved to our private school.ldquoThere were months mum couldnrsquot pay, but the school helped out. Yes, I was at school with girls who had race horses in the front garden, but I didnrsquot feel any dferent.She found it hard to catch up with her reading and writing. ldquoI didnrsquot want that for my son, who was quite introverted as well. It had been exceptionally hard for her to pay the fees for his school. She paused before adding ldquoRemember all those times I couldnrsquot come to Glasgow to see you girls  Well that was because I didnrsquot have the money to put petrol in the car.I could see a little of what my friend was so passionate about: I really admired the seemingly over-arching confidence of the girls I had been at school with. I craved that confidence for my children. We were a purposeful, articulate and loyal bunch. We stretched our wings in the sciences, creative writing and Latin.We were surprisingly erse too - from the children of the inherited rich to the daughters of the just-recently-got rich. From the off-spring of immigrants whorsquod arrived with a fiver in their pockets to the few girls who faced abuse walking through some of Glasgowrsquos poorer areas to get to the school, we were quite a motley crew.As a Muslim, I was proud to inform my parents that my best friends were a Jew and a Christian. We confidently asserted ourselves, and expressed our ideas freely, perhaps without fear of what any boys in the class might think of us. Most,not all, of us assumed we would go to university or college and then onto work.But I often wonderedour confidence was a bit like our school unorm, and indeed our accents - something we put on, to homogenise us, to make us a type, maybe to cover up or compensate for any wee shortcomings we might have had.We were also utterly terried of the kids from the local state school. They sat on a wall nonchalantly eating chips as we walked by, but we actually thought they wanted to kill us - a perfect example of how a lack of contact, breeds fear. It floors me to think that,  years later, a close friend and colleague, Kate, who I cannot even contemplate starting a work project without, was one of those chip-eating lsquoterrorsrsquo.I knew that sort of insularity and lack of, as I saw it, iniduality was not what I wanted for my own children.Ultimately, both had six years at state school, having encountered young people from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and abilities, accents and sensibilities.I watch them in their workplaces interact with customers with an ease I could have only dreamt of. They describe nights out that involve skillful de-escalations of potentially dficult situations with groups of other young men in the street.They are quietly confident but always attuned to the group dynamic. Most importantly I value their iniduality, and their determination to go against the flow or fashion. They may not have particular loyalties to their old school tie, but perhaps thats not a bad thing."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-offer-new-brexit-plan-brussels","story":"The UK will offer Brussels a revised Brexit deal by the end of the week as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ramps up efforts to strike an agreement.It is understood the legal text of a Brexit plan will be sent to Brussels after the Tory conference concludes on Wednesday.The move comes as Irish broadcaster RTE reported the UK had put forward the idea ofcustom clearance centres being set up five to ten miles either side of the Irish border.:Opposition leaders plot to stop Boris Johnsons no-deal Brexit planHowever, Government sources distanced themselves from parts of the reports.The reported plans by the British Government to create customs posts along both sides of the Irish border to replace the backstop were dismissed by Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney.The idea for the customs posts are contained in the so-called lsquonon-papersrsquo submitted by UK officials during recent technical discussions.Mr Coveney poured cold water on the plans, saying Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ldquodeserves better.:Scottish court bid to ensure Boris Johnson \"obeys law\" over Brexit to startHe tweeted: ldquoNon-Paper  Non-Starter.

The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably.

They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But its integrity was soon called into question by members of the public, concerned that gravestones were being laid flat without clear notice. Meanwhile, a council insider accused the local authority of failing to abide by guidelines for testing the memorials.A report to this Thursday#s meeting of the Council#s Monitoring and Audit Committee has set out key findings, and has made a number of recommendations for how the programme should be improved for any future works.In all,  recommendations were made — with six described as high priority.According to an official statement from Orkney Islands Council, key findings of the report were that:The six high priority recommendations were that:According to OIC, a further five recommendations have already been progressed — these are:Additional recommendations included:According to OIC, progress in delivering and completing the actions that have been requested will be reported to future meetings.Work to re-erect headstones in Orkney#s cemeteries is continuing with five cemeteries now completed, and one more expected to be completed shortly.Work will also be getting underway to identy and make safe stones where required in the remainder of Orkney’s kirkyards as part of a continuous programme of public safety over the months and years ahead.The full report is available here  # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Files Committees-and-Agendas Monitoring-and-Audit MA MA-- I.__Burial_Grounds_Memorial_Safety__.pdf.

Mr McArthur and Ms Wishart subsequently wrote to Abellio to relay these concerns directly and urge a rethink on the decision.According to Mr McArthur, Abellio has responded to say that it is exploring the possibility of working with a retailer to provide a left luggage facility as part of the station redevelopment. Both Northern Isles MSPs have called on Abellio to fast track those discussions so that agreement is reached on a proposed alternative before the current facility is removed.Mr McArthur said: “Passengers travelling to and from Orkney and Shetland by ferry, rely on the left luggage facility at Aberdeen railway station. The proposed closure will have a disproportionate impact on our constituents, many of whom are not able to carry around large bags and suitcases, while they wait for their ferry or train to depart.“Even at this late stage, we hope Abellio will agree to review this decision and take steps to minimise any impact on islanders.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He’s a fine actor, obviously, but we also have a couple of things in common. We share the same dentist, or at least shared, back in boyhood in Edinburgh, when surgeries were grim places, waiting-rooms contained not a single dog-eared copy of the Beano, and memories of the brown rubber mask jammed over your mouth just before the knockout gas took effect could still evoke a shudder half a century later. We were struggling to remember his name until I mentioned the mask. “That was it – Mr Brown,” said Stott, holding his jaw in mock pain. “And he just loved pulling teeth.”The other thing we have in common is that we’ve both pretended to follow the rival capital football team from the one we support – me for a book and Stott to play Ian Rankin’s detective John Rebus on TV. Rankin wrote the character as a Hibs fan and Stott, a follower of Hearts, has just had to lump it and wear the scarf. Writer’s prerogative and all that.But this hasn’t stopped Stott wondering about Rebus’ politics. Indeed he’s done more than wonder, firing off a letter to Nicola Sturgeon insisting that the grumpy gumshoe is an indyreffer and not the No voter the author claims.: Why Rebus said sorry for wearing a Hibs scarf – Steve CardownieFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThis has been boiled up into a row. A “public war of words”, according to the report I read, with Stott apparently “incensed” by Rankin making the crabbit cop wear a metaphorical Unionist bunnet when almost everything about him points in the other direction.What a hoot. I don’t think anyone is incensed and am sure all the participants will be having a laugh about this, especially Stott, who some have felt the need to inform that Rebus isn’t actually a real person, that writers make stuff up, and that characters belong to them and not actors.You’re a luvvie!Er, I think he will know all of this. And I reckon the nub of the issue here is in the report’s headline which labels Stott a “luvvie”. You see, actors aren’t supposed to have views about anything beyond the film play telly programme they’re promoting. They’re not supposed to engage with the world. If they try and do this they’re ridiculed.That was just a performance! You read something right-on in theand you memorised it! You’re a bleeding-heart, look-at-me-I’m-wonderful, feel-the-warmth-of-my-sincerity, jump-on-any-cause, over-emoting git! You’re a luvvie!Am I about to say something in defence of Actors With Opinions  I think I might be. Goodness knows I’ve met plenty without. In a previous le I interviewed actors all the time. They’d talk about “the work” and nothing . They’d talk about their characters asthey were real people. They’d analyse their characters’ motivations like they were Sigmund bloody Freud. Then, exhausted and appalled and desperate to end this charade, I’d ask the plaintive final question that I knew to be hopeless: “So, what do you do when you’re not acting ” Always the reply would be: “Oh, I love going to the theatre and the cinema.” In other words, you watch other actors act. In other words, you’re just as insecure and neurotic as the rest, and just as much of an empty vessel as well.: Why Scotland must move on from independence referendum Sturgeon cannot call – Brian Wilson: Scottish independence: Scottish Tories rule out supporting ‘supermajority’ in second referendumSo when actors attempt to fill the vessel with notions, ideas, a bit of themselves, something which angers inspires them, anything apart from the bland pfle which forms the basis of most celebrity interviews, what do we do  We make fun of them.The actor knows he’s his own worst enemy. Martin Freeman, star of The Office, Sherlock and currently A Confession, is extremely nervous about members of his profession getting political. “It’s deeply annoying to have someone like me, who doesn’t know everything, bang on,” he says. “Actors can be pompous and we can overestimate our importance.”And Katherine Parkinson from The IT Crowd and right now Defending the Guilty says: “Actors who aren’t that informed going on about their politics make me cringe. It’s very easy to call yourself a feminist and often men that might say it the loudest are the first to stick their hand on someone who’s not their girlfriend’s knee.”Reagan dismissed genuine heroismSo what’s worse: an actor who talks about politics but is a groper ... or a prime minister, women on either side of him at lunch, who’s dubbed “the double thigh-squeezer”. Almost certainly the latter, but the actor who puts himself out there politically should be allowed to make the odd mistake and drop the occasional clanger. Yes, what they say can make them seem self-important and sanctimonious but surely that’s down to delivery they’re more accomplished at getting up and speaking than you or me .I’ve laughed at actors plenty. My favourite story about political actors concerns Ronald Reagan when he was trying to win a second term as US President and Democrat rival John Glenn, the former astronaut, received a boost in the polls from the film The Right Stuff about the true le adventures of the Mercury Seven rocketmen. Reagan dismissed Glenn as “just a celluloid hero” until it was pointed out to him that the latter had carried out all the daring portrayed in the movie. Reagan on the other hand had not actually shot a bad guy, quelled a ‘Red Indian’ uprising, saved the day. These had just been his movies, and B-movies at that.We have not as yet in this country handed the keys to power and control of the big red button to an actor. Good for us, you might say ordinarily, but right now you could well wondera melodramatic thespian would do any worse.

It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

In it, the Prince praised the #fibre of ecological choice# for its sustainablity and biodegradable properties, as well as providing a vital income for crofters and farmers.Patrons from previous years took to the stage to speak about their creations, and a musical interlude which gave an opportunity to mingle, share their stories and admire the design and colourways of each other#s knitwear.Newcomers to wool week were a young family from China.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm. The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology. That’s where the economy of the future is and we should be preparing for it now.“I want to pay tribute to the immense strength and resilience of the shipyard workers and their trade union representatives who made this a pressing political priority.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lamh dhearg and portglenone get ready for part three","story":"BOTH Lámh Dhearg and Portglenone will be hoping it’s third time lucky in Ballymena this eveningas they meet once again to see who will advance into Sunday’s Antrim Senior Football Championship final.Thursday’s replay at Queen’s Arena was another night of high drama as Conall Delargy kicked an equaliser deep into stoppage time to force extra-time and Casement’s thought they had got it done as they led by one in the dying seconds of the additional period, only for Ben Rice to storm through and kick another equaliser with the last act of the game and force a free-kick contest.After five kicks each, the teams were level at - so it went to sudden death with the five kickers going again and all converted, prompting Antrim chairman Ciaran McCavana to step in and offer the teams the opportunity of another game to decide it in a more orthodox manner.His decision mostly drew praise from throughout the county and it was also applauded by Lámh Dhearg manager, Mairtín Lynch, who felt McCavana did the right thing.“I thought it was terribly brave of the county board a to advocate this and they should be given great praise for what they did,” he said.“Both teams need massive respect because they#ve brought tremendous goodwill to Antrim football. Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

But he remains active with programmes at the post-presidency centre he and Rosalynn Carter opened in Atlanta in . He still teaches Sunday School at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains. Happy th Birthday, President Jimmy Carter! May you enjoy the day and celebrate many more! @CarterLibrary collection portrait-card from @CarterCenter @OurPresidents pic UtNFYyD— Jimmy Carter LibraryOctober , The Carters plan to travel later this week to Nashville, Tennessee, where they will help build houses for Habitat for Humanity.Mr Carter survived a dire cancer diagnosis in  and became the longest-lived US president in history this spring, surpassing George HW Bush, who died in . Rosalynn Carter, , is among the longest-lived first ladies. The couple have been married  years.In recent public appearances, the former president has sounded like a man still intent on securing his legacy, amplying his criticisms of American military spending and war, blasting the proleration of money in US politics and urging action to combat the climate crisis. He has expressed particular pride that the US engaged in no foreign wars during his tenure.“I just want to keep the whole world at peace,” he said in September during his annual Carter Centre report.“We have been at war more than  years. We have been at peace for about  years,” he said of the US since the Declaration of Independence in . He said every US military conflict from the Korean War onwards has been a war of “choice”.A Naval Academy graduate and Second World War veteran, Mr Carter said presidents feed the cycle, in part because “we make a hero” out of wartime commanders-in-chief.The Carter Centre, which has focused mainly on public health, election monitoring and conflict resolution, has “never voiced an opinion publicly” on inidual wars, he noted.“This is primarily my fault,” the former president said, explaining that he wants the centre to become a more forceful advocate on questions of war around the world, including “wars by the United States”.He said the Carter Centre could engage in “constructive criticism of the United States government … without being partisan about it”.An outspoken Christian, Carter sometimes frames his views on war in terms of his faith, noting that Jesus is referred to in the Bible as the “prince of peace”.He has not backed anyone in the Democratic presidential primaries, but he says re-electing Donald Trump would be “a disaster”."},{"url":null,"title":"70 year old marathon man dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"global climate strike wonderful thing see new generation rise","story":"Young people took to the streets of Derry over the weekend to demand action against climate change.Hundreds of Derry students left school on Friday as part of a global climate strike to sound the alarm about what is widely viewed as an “environmental emergency”.And again on Saturday, young people were at the centre of the Our Earth Our Future March, Rally and Gathering which retraced the original civil rights route from the Waterside to the Guildhall.At Friday’s climate strike, one organiser, Rois Hutton, told the crowd they must target political parties and people with influence to insist upon \"radical quick changes\" so that \"we can ensure the survival of the human race.”Another of those behind the strike action, Emma Farren, said that this strike dfered from those held on previous occasions because adults had taken a stand alongside the youth of the city.She urged those in attendance to continue to stand with them to bring about meaningful change.Their actions prompted veteran civil rights activist, Eamonn McCann, to declare on Saturday that in all his years of campaigning he has never been more \"hopeful\".\"What made me hopeful is the composition of the marches. The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Several of them would be subjected to severe political pressurethey made a decision to close on Monday.At the outset of the discussion the boardrsquos chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, said he did not wish to open debate on the already widely discussed issue. The allocation of exceptional holidays remained a matter of departmental policy whatever board members might think inidually.Mrs Ethel Smyth said the matter was causing great concern in the area and that she had already condemned Lord Elton for the action he had taken in offering Monday as an exceptional holiday.Only a native lord from England would have made such a mistake. In her view, it might have been quite proper for the Roman Catholic maintained schools take one of their ten optional days holidays to see their spiritual leader of their church.In all but one of the controlled schools in her area good sense had prevailed and those schools would remain open on Monday.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings.

The crowd was similarly delighted when Mrs Foster said the police should make clear that they were going “to get these people”they used violence.Mrs Foster said that she had not supported the  Belfast Agreement but had to accept that it was endorsed by a referendum “and move on to the next battle” and try to have input into its implementation.She was, she said, “really saddened at [the EU’s attitude to the fact that] unionism doesn’t support the backstop”.She added: “It gives no democratic say over rules imposed by the EU.”Mrs Foster said: “No-one wants full infrastructure at the border.

I wasn’t ever asked about Theresa May — and frankly I should have been.”The audience laughed and applauded that comment.Kate Hoey similarly got laughs and applause when she told the event: “I’m glad the prime minister has called [the Benn Bill] a surrender bill. We know all about a no surrender bill.”Ray Bassett was critical of the Irish government’s refusal to help David Cameron secure EU reforms ahead of the  referendum, and then after the result its decision to ally itself fully with the EU rather than act as a mediator between London and Brussels and help the UK get a bespoke arrangement with Ireland after Britain voted for Brexit. During the discussion, Mrs Foster acknowledged that she was more averse to ‘no deal’ than Ms Hoey, although the latter emphasised that her preference was also for there to be a deal.Mrs Foster said that she believed that there could still be a deal achieved “even at this late stage”.The Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA was on the  at another Policy Exchange event last night entitled ‘How can we strengthen the Union after Brexit’ try catch  TrendingThis Wrightbus worker didnt hold back when asked how he felt about the firm going into administrationHeartbreaking tributes paid to young N.I. woman who died suddenlyDecades after denials, ex-priest admits he was major IRA bomberWright family deny claims that Wrightbus bidders were put off after being asked too much money to lease the propertyWright family make statement -

I have to say that in my area the ministers were very supportive all through that terrible time and since but many people felt that that was not the case everywhere. I would shudder to think that the attitude expressed by the Rev Gribben is now policy of the Presbyterian Church. I understand why there is a concern about abortion being inflicted on Northern Ireland without consent of the assembly but the blame for this situation must be directed at those responsible. Having seen what has happened on the political scene recently I am not so sure that the assembly as it is made up at present would totally reject an abortion act anyway, in spite of opposition from the DUP.Sammy Brush, Ballygawley©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Opinion   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Opinion      Sammy Brush: I can barely believe church is urging DUP to give into Sinn Fein blackmailI must take issue with the views expressed on the news yesterday by the Rev Trevor Gribben who appeared to be speaking on behalf of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.

He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.\"  \"  Supreme Court rules Boris Johnsons decision to prorogue parliament unlawful\"  \"  Jeff Dudgeon: If even Sir Anthony Hart’s inquiry into Kincora, the most rigorous yet, is not believed then we’re in a world of conspiracy theories Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The anonymous data, which has been collected since April this year, will enable authorities to review and analyse transport patterns, using that information to help with traffic planning in the future.  --An example of traffic data gathered from Waze  --Dani Simons, head of public sector partnerships at Waze, said: ldquoWaze has been a pioneer in sharing data with cities and working with them to improve infrastructure and fight traffic. But over the past five years, the landscape has changed. ldquoCities have more data than ever, but they want better tools to analyse it and be able to put it to use to improve their streets. ldquoWe are thrilled to provide this integration with Google Cloud that will make it even easier for our Waze for Cities partners to more seamlessly organise, store, interpret and share transportation data and insights.Anne Shaw, director for network resilience at Transport for West Midlands said: ldquoWaze for Citiesrsquo integration with Google Cloud has enabled us to access a vital amount of information about our local road network. ldquoConsistent across a wide area, wersquore able to trace issues on the road along with other points of the network, like looking at the performance of traffic lights or the conditions of a certain road. ldquoThe free data has helped us revolutionise our transport monitoring and co-ordination systems working within our wider transport partnership with transport authorities and operators..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Mapping app Waze to share traffic data with transport authorities article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.
