I am a self-made woman and I just want to make sure everyone understands you need to keep an eye on your business and to protect it at all costs. You need to take a stand.\u0027I started this business from the ground up. It began in my kitchen and then I built a lab to make the products. I just want to protect what I\u0027ve worked so hard for.\u0027We\u0027ve been in business for just over a year. It\u0027s been so successful.

There are a lot of cosmetics sold, there are a lot of fashion shows, there is a lot of promotional value for the cosmetic industry in New York.\u0027 Representatives of Kylie Jenner told DailyMailTV they had no comment. In July this year, Forbes magazine valued Jenner as being worth $900 million and said Kylie Cosmetics, which she founded in 2016, made up the majority of her fortune, valuing it at $800 million.Forbes predicted she would become richer while still 21, making her the world\u0027s youngest self-made billionaire.

More recent photos on his Instagram suggest he\u0027s upgraded to a larger, pricier abode elsewhere in the countryside.And he poses freely outside it, showing off his collection of expensive cars.He wasn\u0027t afraid to tell Bowman what he wanted to do to her life... but his young fans may raise an eyebrow about the life he leads, now he\u0027s swapped the streets for the village green."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/22/06/51876AAA00000578-6301505-image-a-69_1540186111226.jpg","title":"Meghan Harry spotted boarding flight Fraser Island whirlwind Australian tour continues","story":"    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex reunited after spending the afternoon apart, with Meghan wearing a thigh-high split maxi dress          After Meghan had greeted him at the end of the pier, the couple walked down together to meet the waiting crowds, smiling as they held hands      Read between the lines like Meghan in a striped dress by ReformationTake a closer look here...The Duchess of Sussex might have taken things a bit easier on the latest day of the royal tour, but she still managed to squeeze in not one but two amazing outfits.The first was a polka dot dress from \u0026amp Other Stories, then there was this striped maxi, which is by eco-friendly American brand Reformation.

The first time was by my father – The Prince of Wales – in Bundaberg earlier this year when he was visiting. I now have the privilege of unveiling it in situ,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech. \u0027I know that my father came to K\u0027gari in 1994 for a \u0027\u0027day off\u0027\u0027 during a Royal Tour so he has an appreciation of the importance of this place. Luckily we are both highly skilled when it comes to unveiling plaques.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy is an opportunity for the Commonwealth to unite to protect one of the world\u0027s most important natural habitats – forests. \u0027Forty-two out of the 53 countries are now taking part and I hope that others will join soon. The programme is committed to raising awareness of the value of indigenous forests and to saving them for future generations. Put simply, without trees and forests, we don\u0027t survive. It is a symbiotic relationship, and one that so many people still fail to realise. \u0027As you all know too well, K\u0027gari means \u0027paradise\u0027, and that is certainly what we\u0027ve experienced today surrounded by the towering Kauri pines, 1000 year-old satinay trees and ancient giant ferns. It is up to us now to protect this paradise together – not just because it looks beautiful - but because it is an essential part of our existence, and will continue to be for our children and their children\u0027s children.\u0027The Duke of Sussex was left blushing after a pensioner told him he was \u0027much better looking in person\u0027 at the plaque unveiling.Sassy Mally Clarke, 72, called out to the royal as he attended a ceremony on the island in the Pile Valley rainforest, with the father-to-be looking at his notes and saying \u0027I\u0027ll take that as a compliment!\u0027Rejuvenated Meghan beams lovingly at Harry as they attend an...¿She¿s only pregnant ¿ not ill!¿: Fury as trolls slam...Prince Harry reveals he wants a baby GIRL with wife Meghan...Extreme tiredness, nausea and vomiting: Pregnancy expert...Share this articleAsked by MailOnline why she said it, Mally, a Butchulla elder, said afterwards: \u0027Because he is!

Aides insist Meghan is not sick but simply tired. And the bumpy terrain of the World Heritage island, the largest sand island in the world, simply isn\u0027t suitable for an expectant woman.The Fraser Island rainforest is home to the Island\u0027s satinay trees which, known for their hardiness in water, were used to build the London docks in the 1930s.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

I doubt he roared at her like Gordon Brown did at Tony Blair – “You’ve stolen my fucking budget” – even though she has. Prime ministers in a corner often do it. Blair did it from a TV sofa in 2000, panicking when a cash-starved NHS tipped into crisis: he pledged health spending would reach the EU average (an unknowable moving target). Familiar? May, facing a far worse NHS crisis, promised £20bn – and then went further. Confronting a fractious Tory conference she declared “an end to austerity” (meaning and price tag: equally unknowable).Her Brexit conundrum of impossibilities is of her own making, drawing red lines round herself with no escape. Now she’s red-lined her chancellor: he must abolish the deficit, keep debt falling, cut tax thresholds and “end austerity”, just like that. Impossible, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the great arbiter. It will cost £19bn extra just to stand still, while still cutting another £7bn from benefits: in next Monday’s budget, the public won’t think that ends austerity. May’s foolish promise offers never-ending open goals for Labour.He could reap a bountiful harvest festival of reliefs, costing, says the Resolution Foundation, £155bn a year. That is the size of the welfare state for the better-off and the very rich. HM Revenue and Customs lists only 400 tax reliefs, but as Professor Adrian Sinfield of Edinburgh University unearths, the Office of Tax Simplification has found – but apparently ignores – a remarkable 1,156 lost in the mists of time. Not surprisingly the public accounts committee protests at the lack of knowledge about their purposes and costs.Farmland is another place to avoid tax: the mega-rich buy it to hand on tax-free to their children, as if they were real farmers. Why is capital gains tax on property and shares forgotten after someone dies? Tax relief for Alternative Investment Market shares, intended for startups, mainly benefits the super-rich. Better-off pensioners should pay national insurance, and property should be revalued for council tax. There are scores more of these bonanzas that the most reputable fiscal experts would abolish.A garden of tax reliefs blooms out there, waiting to be gathered in. If Hammond dare not, then lucky Labour will reap them instead. Very few are likely to trouble the ordinary voter: squawks from those who have benefited richly over the years will be easily ignored. Austerity really could end if Hammond and May wanted it to. Their political lives will be short, so why not?Well, because they are Tories. Instead, they plan to make savings by cutting public sector pay in the poorest areas, by introducing regional instead of national pay rates. Those with least will get less, making it even harder to attract good staff. This will widen the wealth gap between regions, deliberately impoverishing already “left behind” places. Tories see things differently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f452946ef2677724062b0cbba60ba7762f1c7d7/0_68_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4da84098eff70911de69f34def5c3a7f","title":"homes affordable land councils developers lease individuals","story":"The price of land is a huge barrier to house-building, by councils or developers. Lease to iniduals, and the equation changesLord Porter, the chairman of the Local Government Association, has proposed to “set forth a million builders” by giving residents a role in the design and construction of council-built homes. It’s the latest sign of a radical common sense that is slowly making its way into housing policy, but if government truly wants to unlock the “citizen sector”, there’s an easier way.Slowly, all the political parties are now waking up to the realisation that private developers will never build the number or quality of homes that Britain needs. This is not because developers are just greedy or immoral – it’s because their business model is perfectly designed to make sure they have no incentive to do so. No amount of subsidy or regulation will change that.A new consensus is emerging that, once again, it will be councils who will have the lead role in tackling housing need. And with greater power to borrow, they will be able to.But there are a few catches. First, like any developer, councils’ bandwidth is limited. Building a thousand homes takes a million hours of attention. Second, even though there is no shortage of land (tens of thousands of undeveloped small sites already under public ownership), are local communities really going to support thousands of cookie-cutter, council-built homes popping up in their neighbourhoods? Third, there will always be a temptation to go for numbers, and compromise on quality, instead of investing in building generous, healthy, low-energy homes and resilient neighbourhoods that meet people’s (erse) needs, and really allow them to put down roots.This is where some clearer thinking might be needed. Allowing people to customise their homes (for example, choosing the layout) is a good thing, as is helping future tenants bring down the price of those homes by allowing them to help build them. But it doesn’t really change the economics of development that much. In fact, those things often can make the process more costly and complicated for councils. There must be a better way.What Porter is stumbling into here is one of the most obvious pieces of common sense that has yet to become housing policy: the recognition that most of what is unaffordable about unaffordable housing is not the house itself, but the land beneath it.In a sensible world, the people best placed to provide affordable land are councils. However, the people best placed to build the homes on top of that land are the families and communities who will live in them, raise their children in them, and pay the heating bills.In fact, residents are the only people who actually have an incentive to put more insulation into the walls, to bring more daylight into their homes, to create car-free neighbourhoods – in short, to do all the other things that we agree we should be doing in the 21st century.So why not just lease the plots at an affordable price directly to local families and groups, who can then build – or buy – homes for themselves? There are plenty of examples to follow. From Almere in the Netherlands where citizens can buy or rent “serviced plots” with pre-applied planning permission, to London, where the GLA have begun making small sites available through the Smal Sites portal.Imagine being able to go to a website, find an affordable plot of land near where you live, and apply to lease it with only a few clicks. Once you’ve got the lease, imagine being able to connect with a whole array of companies and local lenders who can help you get a home customised to your needs. Some families will choose to do it as part of a group or social enterprise, some will choose to do it as iniduals. Some will commission a builder or manufacturer to make a house for them, others will physically build the homes themselves.The result wouldn’t just be thousands of genuinely affordable homes, it would also be a huge boost for UK housing innovation and, most importantly, it would produce places that are genuinely affordable, beautiful, sustainable, socially resilient and loved by the people who live there. Places to be proud of.Whichever model is used – and hopefully the answer will be “all of the above, please” – what is needed to make this happen isn’t just investment into building homes themselves, it is investment into creating the digital, legal, financial and physical infrastructure that will make the process simpler and easier, for everyone.Put plainly, if you want to “set forth a million builders”, first build a road for them to go forth on.• Alastair Parvin is the founder of Open Systems Lab, a non-profit company working on digital innovation in housing and the built environment"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb8ba60f442e8bf4b851c4164cb4c6d25625281d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fff97524de9df500af237f8176ae5e5","title":"rock music survive testosterone guitar female","story":"One of the best albums released this year is called Tell Me How You Really Feel. It was created by Courtney Barnett, a 30-year-old singer-songwriter from Melbourne in Australia recently described as “the ultimate paradoxical millennial”.Her writing is fresh, eloquent and full of surprises. One of the album’s best songs is aimed at a male internet troll, and has a chorus that paraphrases Margaret Atwood: “I wanna walk through the park in the darkMen are scared that women will laugh at them … Women are scared that men will kill them.” It is called Nameless, Faceless, which has obvious echoes of Nirvana’s 1991 track Endless, Nameless – and highlights the fact that one of Barnett’s clear inspirations is Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain, who once wrote of “the comfort in knowing that women are the only future in rock’n’roll”.Guitar-driven rock is now heading towards its mid-60s, and is largely absent from the singles charts that were once a massive part of how its exponents judged their worth. On a bad day, there is a sense that most rock musicians are running out of creative permutations, as if the possibilities offered by 12 notes and the 44 beat have all been used up. That said, it is hard to separate the question of whether rock has any life left in it from a mountain of ideas that have long been bound up with the dominance of men, and the fact that most of them have now curdled into hopeless cliche. Picture David Brent from The Office playing his infamous Bruce Springsteen-esque anthem Free Love Freeway, and you should instantly understand that things that once seemed thrilling and romantic – cars and girls, leather trousers, Jack Daniel’s – now look not just outdated but completely ridiculous.By contrast, there is a different, women-centred lineage that continues to inspire not just high-achieving musicians but people picking up guitars and microphones for the first time. Its beginnings lie in the cleansing fires of punk rock, and such pioneering artists as Patti Smith, Siouxsie Sioux, The Slits, Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex, the Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde and Penetration’s Pauline Murray. Twenty years after those talents arrived, the most creative aspects of so-called Britpop were embodied by Elastica, a female-fronted quartet whose music was full of confrontation and wit – while in the US, the so-called grunge era saw the rise of bands such as Babes in Toyland, L7 and Hole, commanded by Cobain’s widow Courtney Love. At around the same time, the still-overlooked genre-cum-upsurge known as riot grrrl emerged from Olympia, the capital of Washington state. Among the avowed aims of the women at the heart of it was to make themselves heard “in the face of beergutboyrock that tells us we can’t play our instruments” the riot grrrl ideal eventually inspired those noble Russian provocateurs Pussy Riot.Put all those things at the centre of modern musical history, and a few other things become clear. By some distance, the pre-eminent English songwriter of the last 20 years is surely PJ Harvey, whose feats of invention and creative boundary-pushing have never let up. Judged by similar criteria, there are few more exciting modern talents than the aforementioned St Vincent, aka Annie Clark, whose inspired approach to her instrument was summed up by a former collaborator: “All the men usually just played a lot of notes really fast. But when Annie’s turn came, she refused to do the obvious white-male masturbatory thing on the guitar … She made such weird sounds. It was like the Loch Ness monster giving birth inside a silo.”A lot of the current crop of successful women musicians would be uncomfortable with anyone zeroing in on their gender. With good reason, piously opining about such things – particularly if you’re a man – has been serially mocked with the cliched journalistic category of “women in rock”, an idea so hoary that it has its own Wikipedia page. I can only write as someone with a deep attachment to the noise made by guitars and drums, and a slight discomfort about making a point that nonetheless seems self-evident: that the small number of artists doing anything interesting with the rock form are disproportionately female, and a lot of that is down to two things – the absence of testosterone, and an instinctive avoidance of all the macho baggage that now sits on rock like a dead weight.And yet: as women and girls apparently crowd into guitar shops, a belated rebalancing might be upon us, something that is also suggested by developments in my own home. As I write this, my nine-year-old daughter is practising the drums: a fearsome noise that regularly crashes through the house, righteously drowning out whatever old-fashioned guff I am listening to upstairs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a30868ba078649ebbbc07f9cf53409dad6b2d42/0_72_4901_2940/master/4901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df32a0e63d83ebfa85bfc20adf14329","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hidden","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hidden’The closing date is Wednesday 24 October at 10am.

Pah!” scoffs a character in the comic book Dan Dare, on hearing that his new colleague for a space trip to Venus is – SHOCK! HORROR! – a woman. Cool, calm and collected, Prof Jocelyn Mabel Peabody doesn’t see “what all the fuss is about”, as she faces a lineup of appalled male faces.Peabody is more than competent. “I’m a first class geologist, botanist, agriculturist … and a qualified space pilot as well,” she observes dryly. Who better to evaluate whether Venus might offer a food source that could save life on Earth?Peabody was the first female professor to be illustrated in a children’s picture book, arriving a full 100 years after the first male professor was drawn in a story for young readers in 1850. But she is one of a select few. Only 29 out of 328 academics illustrated in children’s storybooks published up until 2014 are female, according to a new book.This means, says Melissa Terras, professor of digital cultural heritage at Edinburgh University, that “there are hardly any women with expertise being shown to children”.Terras’s new book, Picture-Book Professors: Academia and Children’s Literature, is the result of a research project she began after noticing the stories she read nightly to her two sons rarely depicted clever women.To make matters worse, when she was made a professor in 2013 her then five-year-old son said: “You can’t be a professor, you don’t have a lab coat and you aren’t a man.”Children’s picture books have a long tradition of male professors: mad, sometimes evil scientists (Dr Frankenstinker in Mungo and the Spiders from Space), learned father figures (Uncle Quentin in the Famous Five) or absent-minded geniuses (Professor Branestawm in a series of storybooks).This month a prominent professor at Cern caused outrage by saying women were less able at physics, a clear demonstration that work is still needed to change attitudes. Terras says: “We have to acknowledge that there are 150 years of children’s literature, in which, for any occupation – doctors, lawyers – we’re showing children this vast resource of men who rule the world. And we’re also showing them that women are subservient and don’t speak.” Book publishers should be at the forefront of challenging stereotypes, she believes. At the Wise campaign, which promotes gender balance in science, technology, engineering and maths to pupils aged 11-14, the development director and physicist Dr Mhairi Crawford says she doesn’t “mean to be doom-mongering”, but battling centuries of culture that has produced such strong unconscious bias towards men being the natural owners of professional intelligence and expertise is “very challenging”.After three years of research into this particular genre, Terras says that the book industry needs to look hard at itself – and do something different. “There has been no sea change in the children’s publishing industry,” she says. “There’s a hunger for more erse books. Publishers should be broadening out how they reach people, but they’re holding on to the old marketing models. They need new ones.” Picture-Book Professors: Academia and Children’s Literature is published by Cambridge University Press• This article was amended on 23 October 2018 because it wasn’t Dan Dare himself who said “Women!

The study, published in the journal Social Science Research, shows children with access to more books developed a direct positive relationship with literacy, numeracy and even IT skills in later years.In one of several encounters I’ve had with ministers in your department, I provided them with another study, from the US, proving the value of reading for pleasure. I suggested that since the NHS, libraries and schools are public institutions, it would be simple for children to be issued with library tickets at birth, or else on entry to school. I pointed out that it was within the power of the Department for Education to adapt a technique it used several years before with the Language in the National Curriculum project.This created a national conversation among teachers in their localities and regions, where practitioners mingled with researchers, shared practice and developed policy. The National Union of Teachers produced a booklet on the importance of children reading for pleasure. I presented two TV programmes on it.I did it in the naive assumption that the matter was now beyond dispute and a new movement would burgeon, drawing in and uniting the library service with schools, the health service, Booktrust, the Reading Agency, the National Literacy Trust, the voluntary reading organisations such as Beanstalk, the Federation of Children’s Book Groups, the National Association of Writers in Education, the National Association for the Teaching of English, the United Kingdom Literacy Association, the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education, the Education Media Centre, the English Association, the Royal Society of Literature, the Children’s Bookshow, the education and children’s literature departments in universities, authors, illustrators, publishers, booksellers, and the many agencies who put writers and books into schools.The reason I’ve listed them, Mr Hinds, is to remind you of their existence but also because it is within your powers to convene a national conference of all these bodies, tasked with producing an agreed set of guidelines on children’s reading for pleasure.Despite the Ofsted report, the government did almost nothing. No provision was put in place “for all” – which is what the inspectorate called for. The summit I helped to arrange was itself successful, but in my experience, nothing with a universal reach happens unless there is leadership and money from government.Instead what do we have? Reading: the Next Steps contains a handful of clauses. The most laughable of these says: “The government would like all children to be active members of a public library and we are asking all schools to arrange library membership for all year 3 pupils”.Haven’t you and your minister Nick Gibb noticed: lately the library service has been decimated? Then, with what’s left of libraries, instead of putting a library ticket into every child’s hand, you say limply “we are asking …”.The research and the desire are there. The organisations are there, too, but are fragmented. Meanwhile, thousands of children are untouched by any process that would put books into their hands.Changing that involves bringing organisations together, listening to them, and backing their ideas with serious money. It’s not the way anyone in your job has behaved in the last 40 years but maybe it’s time to give it a go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b00ee1d52a70dda4d8cc09f3f2be01836a3fc010/115_75_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=846c5a9b2e25ae0cdb19cafd92566573","title":"ronaldo returns old trafford juventus manchester united","story":"The Juventus forward is back on Tuesday for the first time since Alex Ferguson was still Manchester United managerAt some point on Tuesday night the home fans at Old Trafford will probably sing a round of Viva Ronaldo. From distant metro platforms to wind-raked terraces, it has been a Manchester United standard of the past decade, an Elvis riff on those six years when Cristiano Ronaldo transformed himself from dazzling gadfly to the best footballer in the world.With Ronaldo back in Manchester Viva Ronaldo feels particularly apt, a song about a moment in time and a player that have both decisively passed. Juventus against Manchester United in Group H of the Champions League hardly needs the added soap opera of a personal homecoming. But the fact that it is Ronaldo’s first return of the post‑Ferguson years sees him a much-changed figure, in more ways than one.In outline Ronaldo is a very different kind of athlete to the dandyish kid of the twirling, dancing Vegas years. In recent times Ronaldo has been defined by high‑spec efficiency, the purity of his numbers. Beyond this, Ronaldo returns to Manchester under his own disturbing cloud, the rape and assault allegations from 2009 that are the subject of both a criminal investigation and a civil suit.Ronaldo vigorously denies any wrongdoing. But in the past week the faultlines have begun to tremble a little. Nike is said to be “concerned” about its $1bn Ronaldo‑centered sponsorship deal. As a lever designed to propel Juventus up into the real global A-list, both on and off the pitch, he has begun to look less certain, a little less unassailable.At the end of which, Vegas‑era Ronaldo is more than ever an exhibit, mummified in YouTube clips, preserved in a song that is as much about lost glories and eras passing, a kind of sadness for United’s own best times.There are a couple of elements of Ronaldo 1.0 that seem more vivid now. First, it is easy to forget quite how good and how perfectly realised that Ronaldo was in his final year at United. And to wonder also what might have happened to that expressive, physically inventive wide forward had he continued to develop that way.The following year, his first in Madrid, Ronaldo began to concentrate his powers, to became a more dazzlingly efficient footballer, a machine for winning. As early as 2009-10, a third of his goals came from the centre-forward position. Whereas the 23‑year‑old Ronaldo was the final form of something else, a player that was in many ways more captivating.Not to mention still the greatest the Premier League has seen. It is worth restating this. In October 2008 Ronaldo was five weeks away from his first Ballon d’Or, which he would win ahead of Lionel Messi, Fernando Torres and – in an impressive 12th place – Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal.By the turn of the year, Ronaldo was the best player in a team who had just won the Champions League. Not to mention he was Ballon d’Or winner, Fifa world player of the year, PFA player of the year, Fifpro world player of the year, Uefa club player of the year, World Soccer player of the year, European golden boot and Premier League and Champions League top‑goalscorer. All of which, aged 23, puts Mo Salah’s lone stellar season into perspective, or Harry Kane’s extended peak, or the excellent form of Eden Hazard. They’re all very good. But this is genius-level stuff.It was also Ronaldo’s exit season. His last game was the defeat against Barcelona in the Champions League final. Watching him walk off at the end in Rome you knew he was done. And received opinion would suggest Ronaldo still had all his best times ahead of him, most obviously in the shape of four more Ballon d’Or gongs and four Champions League medals at Real Madrid. A less popular view is that in many ways, his most captivating incarnation was already done.Ronaldo scored 42 goals in 2007-08. Best of all he did it as a winger, or as an innovative inside forward. Look back at the footage now and this Vegas-era Ronaldo has an astonishing range of creative movement, an irresistible urge to improvise. He can dribble, feint, pass, manoeuvre his body into the strangest shapes, find passes and touches and flicks invisible to every other person playing or watching the same game. He scored neck‑wrenching power headers, long shots, breakaways, solo runs. He made Carles Puyol run five paces the wrong way at the Camp Nou with a weird, off-the-cuff shimmy of the hips. He kept making defenders collide, slide into each other, wrestle with thin air.If this Ronaldo still feels a little unreal as his first return since the Fergie years rolls around, it is tempting to wonder how things might have ended up had this version stuck around a little longer, been left to explore the full depth of his own more performative style. The debate over the best player of the modern era would seem a little less binary for a start, less a matter of controlled Terminator-style football versus the more ferretty, imaginative stylings of Messi.As it is, Ronaldo will play his 11th game for Juventus on Tuesday night. A 1-1 draw at home against Genoa on Saturday is the only one they haven’t won, although Ronaldo did score. A similar result at Old Trafford would leave the group looking uncomfortably tight.Until then, this still feels like a homecoming curiosity, a reminder of just how exhilarating that Ronaldo-as-Elvis footballer was and a reminder too, whatever his ultimate destiny, of happier past associations for a player who was, in that three-year spell, the best the league has seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/076c68fe0980d90718e63decef77a5bc118c469d/0_331_3054_1832/master/3054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec0250b8c78dcb6288a1dd1e9ebb58f","title":"womens football gates main stadiums","story":"Cracking crowds is the key to growing the game and bringing teams in from satellite grounds will attract more fansBelow the line on every women’s football article, you see the same comments time and time again, regardless of context. And sometimes, beneath the veneer of vitriol, there are valid points worth answering.However, after being held back by a 50-year ban from 1921, it is a sport that has a huge potential for rapid and wide-ranging growth, as well as the ability to become a very lucrative industry. Interest is high. Euro 2017 attracted a TV audience of 150 million, 43,423 were at Wembley for the women’s FA Cup final in May, and the final of the new Mexican Liga MX Femenil had 51,211 show up – a world record for a women’s club league game.A WSL team plays their home games an average of 13 miles away from their club’s main stadium. This demands travel commitments from their fans – three sides play more than 20 miles away. There is no easy answer to “moving home”, particularly in bigger cities. Land in and around London, for example, is expensive and undoubtedly hard to come by at the scale required.Manchester City provide the best setup by far. The Academy Stadium, a stone’s throw from the Etihad Stadium, is a well-connected and purpose-built ground – shared with the reserve and academy teams. But City are the exception.The decisions to invest, to discuss respective calendars in the same conversations and treat the women’s side as a serious arm of the business, comes down to how clubs see women’s football – whether as a philanthropic effort, one based on public image, or whether they see and buy into the commercial potential of the game. At the moment, it is mostly the former.If clubs were run in the interest of their fans and the wider communities they serve, it would be very different. Supporter-owned Lewes FC provide a glimpse of what is possible but the ownership model of most clubs means the existence of women’s domestic football, in its present form, is reliant on the potentially volatile whims of rich businessmen. The FA is also not without fault. The constant tinkering with the women’s game – from the seasonal change, the restructures and rebranding, the late release of league fixtures – has meant the league has lacked consistency.Helping attendances take a qualitative leap is not an easy task. Bringing clubs closer to home is one way. Allowing more regular use of the main stadium is another.Some argue small crowds in big grounds is not good for the players, atmosphere or televised coverage. However if it means, at the very least, doubling those watching – increasing gate takings and those watching for sponsors – is it not worth it? When Chelsea hosted Wolfsburg at Stamford Bridge in the Champions League in 2013, 3,783 were there to watch. This season, Derby brought Nottingham Forest to Pride Park, breaking the National League (third tier) attendance record with 1,642. Casey Stoney last week said Manchester United, whose new side have had impressive early crowds, are looking at the possibility of the team playing a game at Old Trafford later in the season. When teams play in bigger and, crucially, more accessible stadiums, they see increases on the gates.This is not unique to football. England Netball, in a tender document to UK Sport , said: “Our venue selections have grown from small sportshall facilities with under 1,000 people in attendance, to now selling out large arenas including The SSE Arena, Wembley, the Genting Arena, Echo Arena and the Copper Box.”At the end of August England Rugby announced that the final of three Red Roses’ Tests next month, will see the team play Ireland at Twickenham, following the conclusion of the men’s game against Australia. Other sports, not beholden to the might of the Premier League and football clubs, are able to experiment much more easily.Even a minimum commitment from clubs would be transformative. Host the women’s team twice a year in the main stadium. Piggyback a men’s fixture now and again – not to artificially inflate crowd sizes but to make your investment in women’s football and the progress of the game as a whole significantly more accessible to your most loyal fans. Sell them the game. Arrange free or subsidised travel when playing at the less accessible grounds. Motivate the commitment you are hoping they will make in the long term. Until clubs start to fully embrace the potential that exists, the game will be shackled.Cracking attendances is the key to growing the game. The World Cup may provide a temporary boost and sponsorship may be on the rise but there is only so long sponsors will stick around if people are not watching. The sport needs to take itself from being very much a philanthropic endeavour to a financially incentivised investment.Unlocking attendances unlocks the safe. It is the only way we will see wages and investment rise, negative attitudes smashed, and women’s teams become sustainable and an indispensable arm of clubs.• The Lionesses will travel to Austria for their next test before the 2019 World Cup.

But researchers warn such chemicals risk severe harm to health and to the environment, and that farmers should be offered sustainable alternatives.A comprehensive study of biopesticides, which tend to be less toxic, has identified eight alternatives that can control the caterpillars. Such biopesticides could be provisionally registered by governments while trials are completed, the report authors said.“Maize is a staple crop in Africa and millions depend on it for their food. This is a food security issue,” said Roger Day, programme executive, Action on Invasives, at the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (Cabi).Previous research has found that more than six out of 10 farmers in Ghana and Zambia had applied pesticides, while almost half of farmers in Ethiopia and Kenya used chemical sprays.“Traditionally, smallholder farmers do not use that much pesticide,” said Day, adding there’s a risk that farmers will buy toxic chemicals, without adequate information or protective equipment.The FAO has developed a framework that emphasises alternatives to pesticides.However, cost is a major barrier, with many smallholder farmers unable to afford expensive products, and companies unwilling to invest in registering biopesticides unless they feel there is a market. “It’s a catch-22 because people can’t buy them if they are not available,” said Day.The study, published in the Journal of Applied Entomology, examined literature reviewing 50 biopesticides that are used to control armyworm in Africa or in the Americas. These were judged according to six criteria, including whether they are effective, safe, environmentally sustainable, available and practical for farmers to use.The research, funded by the German and UK governments, identified eight biopesticides that should be fast-tracked for registration and prioritised for trials.Governments could assist farmers by subsidising such alternatives, an approach already adopted in Ghana, the researchers suggest. Where proven biopesticides are not available, governments should also consider partnership with private sector companies to boost local production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bddc8449f76bf79b12198c66054293adb631bef2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20ace2b24868ba1f56808025d2572dc1","title":"is gratitude secret of happiness i spent month finding out","story":"It has become a hugely popular concept in positive psychology and self-help, but is feeling grateful really a panacea? One writer sets aside her scepticism and opens up her gratitude journalA memory came to mind recently of opening presents after my seventh or eighth birthday party – the thrill of the smooth, sharp-edged wrapping paper as I ripped it open, the breathless discovery of the gift concealed within. I also remember the many dull hours in the days that followed, writing thank-you letter after thank-you letter to grandparents, aunties, neighbours and friends, my mother sitting beside me, addressing the envelopes.This could be why the notion of formalised, prescribed and premeditated gratitude, which in the past decade has become the darling of positive psychology and the self-help movement, tends to stick in my craw. So, too, the piles of gratitude journals displayed in gift shops among other tat, bespattered with cheesy quotations at jaunty angles: overcompensatingly “inspirational” gifts for uninspired givers on a deadline. Even hearing the word “gratitude” makes my shoulders tense and my eyes narrow. I am too cynical to get on board this particular Oprah bandwagon – too British, too atheist, too sensitive to schmaltz.But gratitude’s currency continues to increase in value. A “wall of gratitude” was erected in Sheffield last month, built with bricks that each contained a personal message written by local residents expressing appreciation for something important in their lives. Dr Fuschia Sirois, a psychologist at the University of Sheffield who is running the project, explains that a scientific consensus has developed in the past 10 years that undermines my instinctive cynicism. For Sirois and other researchers in this field, gratitude is far more than a slogan on a mug – it is a unique predictor of wellbeing, a protective cloak that could help shield those who feel it from poor mental health.Study after study has found a robust association between higher levels of gratitude and wellbeing, including protection from stress and depression, more fulfilling relationships, better sleep and greater resilience. Simple exercises that people can do on their own – such as spending two weeks writing a daily list of three things for which they are grateful – have been found to increase life satisfaction, decrease worry and improve body image, with the beneficial effects lasting for up to six months. Robert Emmons, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, and a world authority on gratitude, has advocated that interventions such as this be used by therapists to help their patients.Gratitude was one of the most powerful variables that personality psychologists could find when it came to predicting wellbeing, over and above most known factors, from wealth and health to other personality traits such as optimism, Sirois says. “There is something very special about gratitude. It is something wholly unique, unto itself, that, from a statistical standpoint, rises up to the top of the milk, like cream,” she says.But why? What is it about this emotional experience that has such a miraculous impact? How does it work? “I think that’s something the field is still trying to unravel. We don’t yet know what the black box is that links gratitude to these wonderful wellbeing outcomes,” she says. Faced with such unequivocal research findings, my contempt seemed foolish and arrogant, so I decided to swallow my scepticism and give gratitude a go.I couldn’t bring myself to buy one of the journals with a corny saying on the cover, so I used my regular diary. The first night, I struggled to work out exactly what I was supposed to be writing and simply noted some good experiences I had had that day. But that did not seem quite right – I was pleased these things had taken place, but I did not feel what Sirois described as an “overwhelming feeling of appreciation”.The next night I adapted my method and wrote the words “Today I was grateful for”. As I pondered what to write next, I felt a warm, settled, comforting feeling in the pit of my stomach. Over the following weeks, I was at various times grateful for the time to read my book, grateful to my husband for cooking me soup, grateful to feel the stretch of my muscles in my pilates class. I began noticing things to be grateful for as they happened, mentally filing away the moment for that night’s gratitude list. My husband grew used to drifting off to sleep, only to be woken 10 minutes later when I crept out of bed, having realised suddenly what I had forgotten I suspect that, at those moments, any increase I experienced in gratitude was offset by a decrease in his.As the pages in my diary filled up with scribbled gratitude, I started to find the concept less vomitous. But there was still much that left me uneasy about the way gratitude has been rebranded by personalities such as Oprah, Arianna Huffington and Richard Branson as the key for everyone to unlock a successful relationship, career and lifestyle. For some people living in poverty, or who have suffered discrimination, or who have a history of trauma, or whose mental or physical health problems have had a devastating impact, to be told that trying to feel grateful might help may feel like an insult.There may be people for whom keeping a gratitude diary could be counterproductive, says Alex Wood, a psychologist and the centennial professor at London School of Economics who has been a major contributor to this field. There is caution in his voice as he points out that there has been little research into what he calls “the dark side of gratitude”. He says: “The blanket endorsement of gratitude has been too early in the field. I’m suspicious of any claims you should put this into practice on the basis of a few studies, or that this should be used on vulnerable populations such as people with depression.”Some people may find it helpful, Wood says, but it is feasible that others could feel a sense of misplaced gratitude that keeps them trapped in a dangerous situation, where instead of recognising their reality they feel a perverted form of thankfulness towards those oppressing them. “Many people might feel a lack of gratitude because they’re in objectively bad situations. For people in abusive relationships, for example, the answer is to get the hell out, rather than feel more gratitude,” he says. To have a positive impact, it cannot be indiscriminate – it must be “gratitude with discernment”.Scientists cannot yet tell us where, how or why gratitude develops in the brain, says Wood, but he references the economist and philosopher Adam Smith’s theory that it has an evolutionary purpose. Smith argued that society only works if we repay the aid that we get from other people, but since we have no legal or financial incentive to do so, we have evolved a sense of gratitude that makes us do it. “If we’ve naturally evolved to feel it, that rather flips the question from what causes gratitude to what causes ingratitude – why do some people not have the capacity to feel it?”If someone has grown up in an environment in which they cannot rely on the people who are meant to take care of them, in which their need for love is met with neglect and abuse, Wood says, “I think it would be very difficult for them to experience gratitude, with that particular lens through which to view the world”. In that situation, says Tomasz Fortuna, a psychoanalyst and psychotherapist at the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust, “what gets mobilised instead is a sense of threat, a fear of annihilation and the feeling of being persecuted, deprived”.To have the capacity to feel gratitude, Fortuna says, you must be able to receive and accept something helpful or good from another person. It helps if this is something you see happening around you from infancy, so you can learn how it works. It seems to me that a lot of things need to go right for a person to have the capacity to feel gratitude – it is a pretty advanced-level emotion. If feeling grateful to someone else is at least partly contingent on having had healthy, nurturing, nourishing relationships in early life, if it means being able to tolerate feelings of vulnerability and being able to value something given to you by someone else without feeling envious, it is hardly surprising that there is a correlation between gratitude and wellbeing. Hearing this, I felt an instinctive and overpowering sense of appreciation for what my parents gave me as they made me write those thank-you letters. I tried to remember to add it to my gratitude list that night.That is not to say that gratitude cannot develop in later life. At the Portman clinic, Fortuna works with adults who have problems with violence, many of whom had an extremely disturbed, traumatic upbringing. At first, he says, it is not unusual to see very little gratitude from patients, either towards their therapist or towards others. But when a patient begins to feel understood, there can be a shift. “You can sometimes see very small things – a patient appreciating something someone else did for them, like a smile from a shop assistant or a friendly, caring tone of voice on the phone. Suddenly, the patient, who has felt for a long time that everyone is threatening and that they are being persecuted, discovers something friendly in an interaction.” That is a sign of gratitude where none was seen before and it can be a pivotal moment in therapy, Fortuna says. “You can see the emotional development of a person their internal world becomes more enriched, more balanced. It gives us a sense that this work is worthwhile.”This gradual emergence of profound moments through meaningful encounters feels different from the branding of gratitude as a lifestyle choice. There are times when I have to force myself to write my gratitude diary and it feels like a capitalistic stockpiling of emotion, as if I am making deposits into my gratitude savings account, accumulating moments of appreciation to build myself a richer life. Fortuna fears that, in some cases, this kind of exercise could be counterproductive. “I think this could become a kind of positive thinking, where we try to convince ourselves, to reassure ourselves that things around us are good. There is falsehood in this it’s an illusion.” Having the capacity for gratitude, he says, is about having faith that you do not have to earn everything yourself.Nevertheless, after four weeks of counting my gratitude, I think I will keep doing it – for as long as I remember to, at least. I sometimes find that, before bed, my thoughts speed up into an anxious whirl concentrating on what has brought me gratitude that day seems to quieten my mind. I am also finding more things to be grateful for as they happen – it is a useful tool for reflection, for noticing things I might otherwise take for granted.While the diary has helped me in some ways, I am no evangelist. As Wood says, there have not been enough studies to prove that the relationship between gratitude and wellbeing is causal, rather than correlated. We should be wary, he says, of leaping to conclusions about how a gratitude diary can improve mental health: the positive effects may be partly explained by the act of doing something for oneself, with hope and optimism.There have been moments of gratitude in my life that have been transformative and they have all been spontaneous. I have felt it while volunteering at The Listening Place, a charity for people who are suicidal, where I listened to a visitor as she told me the story of her life. I felt the privilege of bearing witness to another human being’s trauma when she needed me to. I have felt it with my husband, when in moments of acute distress I have not known what I needed, but he has. I have also felt it in psychoanalytic psychotherapy, when my therapist has seen and understood me in a way I have never experienced before she has helped me towards the painful realisation that I have unknowingly limited my experience of life through my thoughts, feelings and reactions.At these moments, gratitude has made me feel as if I am experiencing a new layer of life. While keeping my diary has been helpful, at times I have ended up with something that looks like gratitude and sounds like gratitude, but feels like something flatter, just words accumulating on a page – a thank-you letter a child has been forced to write. I remain sceptical of the commodification of gratitude, suspicious of the conclusion, so easily drawn, that if you do not feel grateful it is because you are not trying hard enough – you have not done your gratitude exercises, along with your downward dog and your mindfulness practice and everything else we are supposed to do to perfect ourselves.It is comforting to think of our feelings as being within our control, like a muscle to be trained, only with a notebook and pen. But I believe the reality is more arduous and more luminous. Significant and enduring psychological shifts take time, hard work and, crucially, help from other people, sometimes professionals. The shameful under-funding of mental health services means that many people do not have access to treatment. But when we do get the help we need, real change can become possible. That is a beautiful idea, one that has made me feel truly grateful for being in the world – and I could never have come to it alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080d6b65f59efda86cffbe015ccbde9288586c26/23_112_4344_2607/master/4344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c9af9372f122b4ee92fc74d1b3708ab","title":"should you dress up dog halloween costumes","story":"US dog owners spend $350m a year on elaborate costumes for their pets, and the trend is spreading to Britain. Is it harmless fun – or animal cruelty?Han Solo and Chewbacca. Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion. Alice in Wonderland and the White Rabbit. This Halloween, you can dress as any one of these famous duos by coordinating costumes with your favourite four-legged friend.Halloween has become big business over the past two decades. In 2001, the British public spent £12m a year on it that annual figure has since ballooned to £330m. There has also been a huge increase in spending on costumes for our pets, with more and more high-street stores, including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and H\u0026ampM, stocking them. There are fuzzy pumpkin, Darth Vader and Beetlejuice costumes available at Pets at Home this year, a ghost costume from Lidl and the inevitable unicorn from B\u0026ampM. Rubie’s, which claims to be “the world’s largest designer, manufacturer and distributor of fancy dress costumes”, has a range of more than 50 costumes for dogs, including the chance to dress up your pet as Scooby Doo’s Mystery Machine van.In the US, dog owners are estimated to spend $350m each year dressing them up. The Tompkins Square Halloween dog parade in New York is about to enjoy its 28th year, and features hundreds of dogs in elaborate costumes with props. It is one of the few places on Earth where you can see dogs dressed up as wizarding students riding the Hogwarts Express, a dog driving the time-travelling DeLorean from Back to the Future, pooches lining up as the famously flamboyant rock band Kiss or, thanks to a couple of prosthetics, appearing as the three-headed dog Cerberus.This trend is partly a result of the Instagram age on social media, videos of costumed pets are a genre in their own right. Compilation videos of dogs in costumes can rack up millions of YouTube views, and there are nearly 200,000 posts on Instagram with the hashtag #dogcostume. Social media users have gone wild for Chrissy Teigen’s French bulldog dressed as bacon, Ariana Grande’s shiba inu puppy dressed as a dinosaur and Miley Cyrus dressing her whole canine entourage as a banana split, a hamburger, a hot dog and a UFO.But the trend hasn’t met with universal approval. Over the weekend, Chloe Jackson, a training manager at Battersea Dogs \u0026amp Cats Home in London, questioned it, pointing out: “Not every dog is comfortable with a lot of handling and some will become very stressed if you try to put them in a costume – particularly if it involves forcing their legs into sleeves or putting something on their head.”Linda Ward, who runs the Busters Dog Walking service in Brentwood, Essex, says that, while she would never put her own dogs in fancy dress, she doesn’t see it as a major issue. “Many dogs wear coats in winter, and assistance dogs wear jackets all the time they are working. Lots of dogs don’t even like collars or harnesses being put on, yet that is deemed acceptable.” From a dog’s point of view, a simple costume won’t feel very different. At the more extreme end of the trend, animal welfare activists have questioned the use of creative grooming at Halloween, with dogs having their hair cut, styled and dyed into unusual designs – there is a risk that animals may have allergic reactions to the products.Cesar Millan, whose Dog Whisperer TV show has been broadcast in more than 80 countries, has advised owners to adhere to certain rules around Halloween costumes. While boots and coats can offer protection from the weather, elaborate costumes don’t. He has urged owners to remember that the costumes are for our enjoyment, not the enjoyment of the animal. “They can be very cute, and get a lot of attention,” he said, “but underneath the costumes, they’re still just dogs.”Louise Glazebrook is a dog behaviourist and trainer who runs the Darling Dog Company in London. She says she doesn’t have an issue with dogs in costumes, but there are certain things to bear in mind. “Anything a dog wears shouldn’t inhibit natural behaviour a dog should always be allowed to be a dog. A costume with a hood will cause stress and therefore change the dog’s behaviour and should be avoided. The other thing is to watch out for the material – a dog is going to get really hot in polyester or nylon.”She says every dog is different, and the needs of, say, an Italian greyhound that needs layers in the winter are not the same as those of a bernese mountain dog with its thick natural coat. “Your dog will also tell you if it is unhappy,” she adds. “If their body language says they are unhappy or they seem stressed, just forget the costume altogether.”Most owners would easily recognise if a costume was causing their dog distress, although Ward cautions that they may miss more subtle signs of stress, such as a dog licking its lips or initially refusing to move after the costume has been put on. But, as she reminds us, in the long list of cruel things humans do to dogs, “dressing them up as a pumpkin once a year doesn’t come close”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1ec59dddfc6ceeb1cf862750a87d69415f6bc72/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94bd258db57af8fe10404a5e93c4e706","title":"kanye west donates 73540 to chicago mayoral candidate amara enyia","story":"Rapper becomes second high-profile musician to support outsider candidate, after Chance the Rapper ‘co-campaigns’ with EnyiaA spokesperson for Enyia’s campaign thanked West for his “generous action”. Enyia has already used the money to pay off fees and debts owed to the Illinois State Board of Elections, incurred from a previous mayoral campaign in 2015, meaning she can now be included on the ballot.Compared with Emanuel, who served as chief of staff in the White House during Barack Obama’s presidency, Enyia is a relatively outsider candidate, a Chicago native and community organiser who has focused on economic development across some of the city’s most deprived areas.Her campaign has the support of another high-profile musician, the Grammy-winning Chance the Rapper, who threw his weight behind Enyia last week. The Chicago rapper has donated millions of dollars to public schools in the city through his charity SocialWorks, and was thought by some to be a potential mayoral candidate. But at a press conference on 16 October, Chance denied he had political aspirations, instead siding with Enyia, saying: “I’d like to say, very narcissistically, if I back you, you have a chance, absolutely.”Chance said he would be spearheading a voter registration drive, particularly among Chicago’s young people. “Amara and I share values and a vision for Chicago that includes equitable education for our kids, reforming our criminal justice system, and bringing new kinds of economic opportunities to our communities without causing displacement,” he added, saying they “share a vision on what Chicago could be. We believe in supporting the people at the bottom economically – people who have just been written off.”Enyia said that she and Chance would be “co-campaigning”: “Typically, with celebrity endorsements, it’s sort of a flash-in-the-pan, one-shot deal … We actually are going to be working together and co-campaigning … essentially until the end of the election cycle.” The pair are due to appear at a rally today, to discuss “gentrification and displacement” in the Woodlawn neighbourhood. Chance’s father Ken Bennett is the campaign manager for a rival mayoral candidate, Toni Preckwinkle.West, meanwhile, continues his high-profile political endorsements, following his recent meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, in which he told the president: “We are going to make America great.” Stanley Moore, a county commissioner campaigning for Preckwinkle, said: “If you accept money from a person like Kanye West, are you also endorsing his stance on Donald Trump?”In a  interview earlier this year, Enyia called for Emanuel to step down as mayor, in the wake of comments he made calling for the city’s communities to do more to police the violent crime that has swept Chicago in recent years. “Now after a tragic weekend he calls for the community to step up? He needs to step up – in fact, he needs to step down, because you’ve been here for eight years now and this is the result of your leadership,” she said. “Violence is not a policing issue, it is the manifestation of our public policy failings across the board.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02818647c9fcfd01844d953875a1d4a8a6340a76/997_144_2536_1522/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0d202f3aa5e0d5d5cf77bc9ad560ca","title":"tori amos boys for pele daring to be ugly extract","story":"In an extract from her new book in the 33 13 series, Amy Gentry explains why its rejection of the ideals of feminine and musical beauty are crucial to an understanding of Amos’s 1996 albumWomen and girls have a particularly complicated relationship with disgust. We learn at an early age to be grossed out by our bodies, with their ungainly fat deposits and nipples guaranteed to be the wrong size and slimy, bleeding, wrinkly holes. Later on, we learn that the things we like are also disgusting because we like them. These things include, but are not limited to: unicorns, romance novels, the colour pink, Tori Amos.My first piece of published criticism was a pan of Boys for Pele for my high school paper, the Stratford Oracle. In my review, cleverly titled “Why can’t Tori sing?” to reflect the fact that I knew about the Y Kant Tori Read bootleg even if I couldn’t afford to buy it, I conceded “a developing sense of depth” in Amos’s instrumentals, but lamented that her vocals too often tended toward a “breathy, weightless, shallow whine”. I called the lyrics “low-quality gibberish” and the album as a whole “self-indulgent” and rounded out my review with an arch lip-curl of condescension: “If only Tori had been guided by flow, and not overflow, the album would not have tasted so distinctly and sadly of might-have-been.”What did “might-have-been” taste like to a 17-year-old girl? Self-indulgence. Shallowness. Overflow. All the things a girl who wears scribbled-on Converse and plaid flannels stolen from her dad’s closet might be afraid of the poetry she gave up writing years before the parts of herself she can’t show her first boyfriend, who is into the Jayhawks and writes rhyming poetry that she listens to on the phone at night, when she’d rather be making out with him, with anyone really. The fear of being too much, and the intuition that too-much-ness is something that applies to her and not to him, and that it will follow her all the days of her life, if she isn’t careful to tamp it down, down, down. The truth is, I had listened to Boys for Pele only once on the brand-new CD player I’d gotten for Christmas that year before penning my review. I had to shut it out. It screamed too much.It started with the album art. The cover insert for Little Earthquakes (1992) had been in excellent taste, featuring lots of white space, its bulbous, phallic mushrooms the only hint that something wasn’t quite right Under the Pink (1994) pictured a miniature Amos, etherised in flowing white and surrounded by crumpled cellophane-like layers of atmospheric transparency. On the cover of Boys for Pele, she was life-sized and filthy, covered in mud and hoisting a gun in front of a dilapidated shack. In other images, her piano was engulfed in flames and appeared to be stranded at a truck stop outside of town, as if it had broken down on the road in the middle of the night. Amos herself seemed trapped in The Waste Land by way of an Erskine Caldwell novel. She suckled a piglet she posed on all fours in a barnyard, among the animals and garbage, one shoe missing, face turned away from the camera, her once-white clothes now the same soiled colour as the squalid mattress under her knees.The album sounded like a wasteland, too. A bull groaned in the background of Professional Widow – shades of Tobacco Road again – and other, less identifiable sounds presented themselves throughout the album. On some tracks, the piano was so distorted that it sounded as if it really were being set on fire and although it still appeared on every track, it had been demoted, replaced as the dominant instrument of the album by the harpsichord, a piano with a head cold and a nasty sneer. Softness was all but missing from Boys for Pele at once alien and archaic, the harpsichord is not capable of softness. The transitions were too abrupt, the stripped-down songs too stripped-down – Twinkle was a one-finger lullaby, Beauty Queen a single note plunked over and over – and the whole thing sounded as if submerged, not in musical white space, but in something like black space. The more complicated songs, Blood Roses and Professional Widow and In the Springtime of His Voodoo, were exhausting, the thread of their bizarre lyrics and multiple bridges and breakdowns and deliberately contorted vocals impossible to follow. Melodies were stretched like taffy and then suddenly interrupted to make way for abrasive, spitting lyrics: You think I’m a queer, I think you’re a queer! Chickens get a taste of your meat! Stag shit! Starfucker! It better be big, boy! Fragments of prettiness would reenter the scene, skewed and nonsensical, Band-Aids of grace just soft enough to hurt when ripped away.“Mannered” was not a word I knew to use in high school, but mannered it was. Boys for Pele was Tori Amos’s baroque phase. It was also the last time she ever allowed herself to be quite that ugly, and ugliness, I am now convinced, is much more important for an appreciation of Tori Amos than beauty, though both are always present. On Boys for Pele, their very coexistence is what disgusts. For a woman to be ugly in a way that’s not readable as rebellious, or punk, or cool – ugly in a way that, because of its proximity to the remnants of beauty, reminds you all the time of your potential failure to be the right kind of woman, to be any kind of woman at all – ugly because trying too hard, overflowing, whining and gibbering, too much – not a scream, but a broken soprano – not an abortion, but a pig hanging off a porcelain breast – is worse than tasteless. It’s disgusting.What if disgust were something every woman had to navigate in order to access the idea of taste – in music, in art, and in life? What if an aesthetics of disgust could show us that what we despise in others is actually something we fear within ourselves – and, with the dreadful, frightening persistence of the disgusting, teach us to love it?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f52cba03c946514fa21fc6c70fd9b23ed32cf18/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=812190a8c47e417bcf6a6075281c3caa 960w","title":"sadiq khan eu labour brexit","story":"London mayor sends message to bloc ahead of meeting with Michel Barnier this FridaySadiq Khan has sent a message to the EU that he believes Labour will be forced to oppose the “bad” Brexit deal that is emerging from their negotiations with Theresa May.The mayor of London’s comments come ahead of his meeting this week with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, in which Khan will emphasise the need for far closer economic ties.He will also point to Saturday’s People’s Vote march as evidence of a shift in public opinion in favour of a vote on any agreement reached in Brussels.Khan, who joined calls for a second referendum at the weekend’s demonstration, when almost 700,000 people marched through central London, is to meet Barnier on FridayWhile Khan predicts that Labour will oppose May’s final Brexit deal, Tory whips hope that enough Labour MPs can be persuade to back it in order to outnumber hardline Tory rebels. According to sources in Brussels, Barnier is said to have advised Jeremy Corbyn at a recent meeting that backing the deal would not tie a future government’s hands.But in his meeting Khan will emphasise Labour’s opposition to the free trade deal being negotiated in Brussels. The mayor believes the “Canada-style” agreement will lead to trade barriers being erected due to the UK’s withdrawal from the single market and the customs union, and inflict damage on the financial services sector in the City of London.Khan said: “Theresa May has failed to put the national interest ahead of internal party management in the negotiations and is leading us towards either a bad Brexit deal or, worse still, no deal at all.“This is a lose-lose situation for Britain and the EU, putting jobs, growth and living standards at risk. As mayor, I will continue to stand up for Londoners – not only by engaging directly with Europe, but by putting pressure on the government to change its damaging approach to Brexit and fighting for the rights of all EU citizens who have made London their home.”Khan is also due to meet the British security commissioner, Julian King, on his visit to the Belgian capital. He said: “I’m looking forward to a productive trip to Brussels. As the march through the streets of London on Saturday showed, there’s still huge solidarity with Europe across the UK – both with EU citizens living here and with our European friends and allies.“Our longstanding collaboration and deep connections are rooted in mutual interests and common values, and – whatever happens with Brexit – I will work to ensure London remains a key partner for Brussels and cities across Europe. I want everyone in Europe to know that London will always remain open to business, tourism and talent.”Sources close to Khan emphasised that it was also important for Barnier to hear from leaders in the UK who were not from the Brexiter camp.Giving evidence to a committee of the European parliament on Monday, Guy Verhofstadt, the chamber’s Brexit coordinator, suggested that the UK had been back-peddling on its commitments to avoid a hard border in Ireland in all circumstances. Verhofstadt added, however, that a deal was “still possible” as both sides were determined to avoid a cliff-edge Brexit next year.Also on Monday, Barnier met the former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith, former environment secretary Owen Paterson, and ex-Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, whose support was critical to the Good Friday agreement.The group also included Hans Maessen, a Dutch customs expert who has been advising the European Research Group, the hard-Brexit faction led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, as well as Shanker Singham, a director at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). Singham is known in Westminster as the “Brexiteers’ brain” for his hard-Brexit plan that advocates a free-trade deal with the EU.Duncan Smith rejected suggestions the group was trying to undermine the prime minister, who is struggling to convince the cabinet to back her Brexit plan. “The prime minister gets my full support. That’s it, full stop,” he said. The group had presented some “constructive ideas” to Barnier, which, he said, were compatible with the government’s aims of “what the government says they want to achieve, which is to leave on the best terms and in the best way”.The IEA report, presented last month, argues the UK should ditch May’s Chequers plan in favour of a looser free-trade agreement with the EU. The group declined to comment on the discussions with Barnier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983b45f05970050bafad56ca333f251ac5f4ff97/0_0_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08616e276c07b2e100217c1c7eed2b80","title":"theresa may briefs cabinet on brexit negotiations politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political events including the latest developments in the Brexit sagaThere is little letup in the criticism of former MP and special adviser to David Davis, Stewart Jackson, today. Wes Streeting MP, leading supporter of a people’s vote, has this morning called it a “new low” (yes, we weren’t sure that was possible either): Whatever your views on what’s gone wrong with Brexit, attacking the family of a child recovering from an operation in hospital is a new low. There is a vicious tone to much of our political debate today and that has been often been driven by Brexit supporters like Stewart Jackson. But this latest episode goes far beyond the usual rough and tumble of politics. Stewart Jackson should apologise to this boy and his parents.A eurosceptic cabinet source has told Jess Elgot that Jackson was “out of line”:Stewart Jackson is completely out of line, that this man could be taken into Downing Street by Davis is deeply troubling. David needs to condemn this immediately.A coalition of Nobel laureates has said a hard Brexit could cripple UK science, in a letter to Theresa May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, writes my colleague Jessica Elgot. The letter, signed by 29 Nobel prizewinners and six Fields medallists, says the UK “must now strive to ensure that as little harm as possible is done to research”.Among the signatories was Sir Paul Nurse, the British geneticist who won his Nobel for pioneering work on cancer therapy and tumour diagnosis, and the biologist Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society.“The increasing chaos – because that’s what it looks like – around the Brexit negotiations is causing huge concern among scientists,” Nurse told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The government doesn’t seem to be putting this at the top of its agenda.“I can’t tell you how depressed our young scientists are about the messages coming out of government. This is just awful. You are letting your extremists dominate the debate. You have to get a grip on them.”The science minister, Sam Gyimah, said the government was making preparations to protect collaboration in the event of a no-deal Brexit. “We all recognise that a chaotic Brexit will be a significant setback for science,” he said. “That is why we have got a plan to ensure that, deal or no deal, there will be no cliff-edge for UK science.”Gyimah said there were “unprecedented amounts of money going into UK science – £7bn in the next five years – that is more than we have ever invested in research and development”.Martin Sawer, the HDA’s executive director, who is due to give evidence to MPs on Tuesday, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “A no-deal, we believe, would require some sort of temporary emergency powers to ensure consistent supply to patients in the UK.“It’s a problem about aligning regulations to start with. That creates an ease of transport. It’s also a logistics issue about all the transport infrastructure being tied up in Calais, trying to get into France, that we need to get back here.”It could take “months or years” for alternative supply routes to be established, he said. “We believe, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, there would be shortages and effects to that commodity system that we can’t foresee,” he said. “We don’t know what’s going on, so, because of an uncertain future, we can’t yet plan for what a no-deal would look like.”The UK police’s ability to tackle serious and organised crime could be “significantly impacted” by a no-deal Brexit, the chief of the National Crime Agency has warned.The NCA director general, Lynne Owens, said she was “deeply concerned” that withdrawal from the EU without a deal could deprive UK police of the use of tools like the European arrest warrant and the shared Schengen information system law enforcement database.Asked about the potential consequences for policing of a no-deal Brexit, Owens told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: We are working very closely with our policing partners because we are deeply concerned about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. We have been clear from the very beginning that our ability to share intelligence, our ability to jointly investigate - in this world where there are no borders because of technology - could be significantly impacted, particularly through the use of the Schengen information system, European arrest warrants and our ability to deploy overseas.She suggested that post-Brexit cooperation, which may be favoured by police chiefs in the UK and EU states, could be blocked for political reasons. She said: Whenever I talk to my operational partners overseas, they see there is two-way benefit, but, of course, we aren’t politicians.David Davis’ former chief of staff was under fire on Tuesday for tweeting that the family of a sick child were cretins because of an EU-flag bedcover, writes my colleague Jessica Elgot.Stewart Jackson, the former Tory MP for Peterborough who became Davis’ chief of staff at DExEU after losing his seat, was responding to a tweet with a picture of a boy recovering from an operation in Great Ormond Street hospital. “He’s incredibly brave but gutted he can’t be at the People’s Vote march today,” the tweet said, showing a picture of the boy in a hospital bed under an EU flag.The tweet came after a day of condemnation of violent rhetoric language used by some anonymous Tory sources to describe ousting the prime minister. Labour’s Wes Streeting said he should “delete it and issue a grovelling apology”.One Tory Brexiteer source expressed deep frustration. “After a weekend of disgusting briefing about knives and nooses it is so depressing to read David Davis’s key ally attacking the family of a sick child because they campaigned for remain,” the source said.“We should be able to disagree without resorting to this - it tars all Brexiteers with this vile brush. It’s a real worry that a man with such appalling judgment could be Chief of Staff in No10 if DD ousts the PM.”Science minister Sam Gyimah said that those who used violent language damage were damaging their reputations. “De-humanising and derogatory language, no matter how strongly you agree, is unacceptable in our political discourse,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think that was a low bar, and I hope we do not go back to that. No one can take credibly or seriously people who uses that language.”Jackson deleted the tweet on Monday night and told Politico: “I think it’s awful that people with extreme views on remain like this parent should invade a sick child’s privacy to make a political point.”Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has been on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, denying that he was the source of anonymous quotes suggesting that the prime minister might be “knifed” by internal critics of her Brexit plans or should “bring her own noose” to a meeting of Tory MPs.The comments have been widely criticised across the political spectrum, with Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jacob Rees-Mogg among those condemning the language. Senior Conservatives have demanded the party remove the whip from the anonymous MP who briefed the violent rhetoric to Sunday papers.Bridgen told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s not me. I have no idea who it was. I don’t normally hide behind anonymous quotes. I think these sorts of comments are unproductive.”The North West Leicestershire MP, who submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May in July, added: “We either change the prime minister’s policy or we have to change the prime minister.”Bridgen said he understood that, if 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady receives the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence ballot, he would first call each of the MPs involved to check whether they wish to withdraw their letter. He confirmed he would not change his mind.“Toppling the Prime Minister isn’t the only solution,” he added. “The Prime Minister could pivot away from the Chequers deal which is deeply unpopular in the country and doesn’t deliver the Brexit we promised.”Prominent Tory remainer Anna Soubry has expressed some gentle exasperation at Bridgen’s inclusion on the flagship radio show. Good morning and welcome to politics live blog. I’m Lexy Topping and I’ll be standing in for the inimitable Andy Sparrow today, inevitably doing a worse job at keeping you abreast of the main politics news of the day. This morning Theresa May will brief the cabinet on the progress of the Brexit negotiations after last week’s Brussels summit failed to achieve hoped-for progress. The cabinet is set to meet at Downing Street at 9.30am.At 10am Michael Gove will give a speech to British-Irish parliamentary assembly, while around 12.30pm energy minister Claire Perry will give evidence on preparations for a no-deal Brexit and the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, meets with his Dutch counterpart, Stef Blok.In the House of Lords it’s the second reading of the upskirting bill , while the Lords will also hear oral questions on the £1,012 fee to register for British citizenship, food security after Brexit, and the prevention of anonymous social media accounts. And at 4.30pm the Gibraltar chief minister, Fabian Picardo, will give evidence to the House of Lords EU Committee on, yes you guessed it, BrexitIn other politics news, world-leading scientists have warned Theresa May not to allow Brexit to create new barriers to collaboration across Europe while the body representing health product distributors has warned that emergency powers may be needed to ensure patients can still get the medicines they need after a no-deal Brexit. More on all of these as they come..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cb1179ad6b0ff0d187a4c94e7f7484a91b81839/22_176_4072_2443/master/4072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d91662a7cdc487270da737abde3862c","title":"oldest intact shipwreck thought to be ancient greek discovered at bottom of black sea","story":"Archaeologists say the 23-metre vessel has lain undisturbed for more than 2,400 yearsArchaeologists have found what they believe to be the world’s oldest intact shipwreck at the bottom of the Black Sea where it appears to have lain undisturbed for more than 2,400 years.The 23-metre (75ft) vessel, thought to be ancient Greek, was discovered with its mast, rudders and rowing benches all present and correct just over a mile below the surface. A lack of oxygen at that depth preserved it, the researchers said.“A ship surviving intact from the classical world, lying in over 2km of water, is something I would never have believed possible,” said Professor Jon Adams, the principal investigator with the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (MAP), the team that made the find. “This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world.”The ship is believed to have been a trading vessel of a type that researchers say has only previously been seen “on the side of ancient Greek pottery such as the ‘Siren Vase’ in the British Museum”.That work, which dates from about the same period, depicts a similar vessel bearing Odysseus past the sirens, with the Homeric hero lashed to the mast to resist their songs.It was among more than 60 shipwrecks found by the international team of maritime archaeologists, scientists and marine surveyors, which has been on a three-year mission to explore the depths of the Black Sea to gain a greater understanding of the impact of prehistoric sea-level changes.They said the finds varied in age from a “17th-century Cossack raiding fleet, through Roman trading vessels, complete with amphorae, to a complete ship from the classical period”.The documentary team made a two-hour film that is due to be shown at the British Museum on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ddf32674804687776dded7720189f1da7930ddc/394_639_6139_3683/master/6139.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c64884db34dca32470729e3e32bc101","title":"some processed meat free alternatives saltier than seawater","story":"Campaign group says many such products are exceeding maximum salt targets, despite being seen by some as a ‘healthier’ optionMany processed meat-free alternatives, seen by some as a “healthier” option, are exceeding maximum recommended salt levels, with some being saltier than seawater, a campaign group has warned.Action on Salt said meat-free burgers contain on average more salt than real meat burgers. Beefburgers tested by the group, based at Queen Mary University of London, had an average salt content per serving of 0.75g, lower than that of meat-free burgers at 0.89g.Meanwhile, many other products are exceeding maximum salt targets, it said. The campaign group has called for action from Public Health England to address its concerns over meat-free products.Action on Salt said one in five of the products it tested do not have any front of pack colour-coded labelling. The group said processed meat alternatives, including meat-free burgers, sausages and mince, are “concealing” high levels of salt, after analysing information on 157 meat alternative products.It said the saltiest products in the survey – Tofurky’s Deli Slices Hickory Smoked and Tesco’s Meat Free 8 Bacon Style Rashers – both contain much more salt per 100g than seawater.“The food industry have ensured greater availability of meat-free alternatives, but now they must do more to ensure that meat-free alternatives contain far less salt – at the very least lower than their meat equivalents,” said the Action on Salt nutritionist Mhairi Brown.“This survey drives home the urgent need for Public Health England to reinvigorate the UK’s salt reduction strategy.”Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chair of the campaign group, said: “Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure to reduce the number of people dying or suffering from entirely unnecessary strokes and heart disease.“Given the vast amounts of strokes and heart disease that could be avoided and huge savings to the NHS, it is incomprehensible that Public Health England are not doing more to reduce the amount of salt in our food. We are again calling on PHE to take urgent action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a28768ec0d0d233c27400e137e1e4e4fa2c77361/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a88be4b06186a1b1186a9e7bd212dc35","title":"england statement new zealand series janes graham","story":"• Tourists arrive for series on back of beating Australia• Graham says international game is in best of healthJames Graham believes international rugby league is in its rudest health for some time and wants a new-look England side to underline their credentials as the closest contenders to the world champions, Australia, by making a statement of intent against New Zealand this autumn.These are fascinating times for the international game. With Tonga emerging as a force in last year’s World Cup, England’s improvement under Wayne Bennett and the slightest glimmer of a chink in the Kangaroos’ armour after the retirement of Cameron Smith and Johnathan Thurston, the road to the next World Cup in 2021 will be captivating.Graham says it would be foolish to label the Australians vulnerable but he admits there is a changing landscape. “You’ve seen with the World Cup, New Zealand beating Australia last week and our own performances, the strength of the game,” he says. “I think it’s great. That’s before you consider Samoa and Fiji, too, so the game is healthy.”New Zealand arrive in England for the three-Test series, which begins in Hull on Saturday, fresh from beating the Kangaroos. The Kiwis disappointed in the World Cup, losing to Fiji in the quarter-finals, but Graham says Michael Maguire’s side will pose an opportune yardstick for a much younger England side, who began their autumn programme with a 44-6 win over France on Wednesday. “They are such a talented group,” he says. “We saw them perform really strongly against Australia and they are coming over here to give their best.”England are without Ryan Hall, Gareth Widdop and Sam Burgess because of injury but Graham, his country’s most capped player, is keen to see how the next generation fare. “Granted, there are some talented players who are unavailable but that doesn’t really matter. Let’s focus on who is here and get behind them because they’ve got the chance to impress, and they’re doing that so far in training and in the game against France in Leigh.”One of those, the St Helens forward Luke Thompson, is a player Graham keeps an eye on. “I’ve followed Luke’s career since he broke through,” says Graham, likewise a former Saints junior. “We didn’t get to play together but you can see he’s one hell of a competitor. He’s a real up-and-coming forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9721e9fba693338c9a6a4a637e9c3cd8e3996b13/15_0_4785_2872/master/4785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b7a0ded544a64e26d69851e25e64c53","title":"world series 2018 predictions boston red sox los angeles dodgers","story":"Will Clayton Kershaw end the Dodgers’ title drought? Or will Mookie Betts and Co continue their rampaging regular-season form?This could very well be an epic World Series, even if it appears one-sided on paper. One would think that a Boston Red Sox team that beat the dangerous Houston Astros in five games, should be the heavy favorites. However, the ALCS was much closer than the 4-1 outcome suggests. (The numbers, for instance, say that Red Sox closer Craig Kimbrel has been perfect in save situations this postseason, Boston fans will tell you that he was anything but.) Still, there was a reason that these Red Sox won a record number of games during the regular season and took out two very scary teams in the Yankees and the Astros. It should be close, which means that it may come down to who makes the right moves and, well, Red Sox fans trust Alex Cora more than Los Angeles Dodgers fans trust Dave Roberts. David Price gets two wins in the series and manages to hit a home run in one of the National League games and walks away with the MVP honors, kills all those postseason narratives and gains some benefit of the doubt from the Boston sports media … at least until his next game against the New York Yankees. Red Sox to win in seven.It appears nothing can stop the Red Sox. Not even that ropey bullpen: Boston relievers actually improved against the Yankees and Astros. Meanwhile, Boston’s boppers have scored even more runs per game in October than they did in the regular season. Yes, even with Mookie Betts at second base, Boston are favorites.Unlike the Sox, the Dodgers have real, sky-high stakes: Los Angeles haven’t won a World Series title in 30 years. After the season, Clayton Kershaw, could opt out and take his future hall-of-fame pitching talents elsewhere. So yes, the Dodgers need to win now, badly.Can they? Well, yes. They’ve had to scrap to get where they are: LA were nine games back on 1 May, and slowly recovered before finally pushing past the pesky Colorado Rockies in game 163.Now, after seeing off a team of destiny in the Milwaukee Brewers, the Dodgers are pressing for more. They strike out plenty, but unlike the Yankees, proved they can pivot in a pinch. Dodger power is as advertised: Roberts often fields lineups with seven hitters with over 20 home runs, setting them up nicely for DH games in Boston. LA are loaded with talented pitching, including, of course, Kershaw, who is desperate for that elusive ring. I think he gets it. Dodgers to win in seven.For all the derision over Clayton Kershaw’s past performances in the postseason – he was 7-7 with a 4.35 ERA in 28 games entering the 2018 playoffs – the lefty quietly has a 2.39 ERA over 19 innings including two quality starts in 2018. The Dodgers’ starting rotation has been far from their best, and will need to improve quickly if they’re to hang with the Red Sox, who have scored an MLB-best 56 runs this postseason. Boston have been masters at getting on base, and through two rounds, five starters have an on-base percentage greater than .370. Boston have won each of the last three World Series they have appeared in and, for that reason, I’m going with the Red Sox to win in six.Both teams have great starting rotations, bat deep, and have several players who can singlehandedly win games. With so little to choose between the two, the series is likely to go down to the few weaknesses in the sides – which could tip the balance towards the Dodgers.The Red Sox have more questions marks as the series starts: will Craig Kimbrel’s struggle to find the strike zone continue, and will Alex Cora continue to trust him if it does? Is Chris Sale actually healthy? Has David Price really exorcised his bad playoff record? How will they find space for JD Martinez in the games without a designated hitter?Meanwhile the Dodgers have come through every time their backs have been against the wall. It would be a surprise if Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill, Walker Buehler and Hyun-jin Ryu weren’t able to combine for at least five solid starts between them, and every batter in the lineup is capable of hitting home runs at key moments.A key subplot will be Manny Machado’s increasingly entertaining heel turn. After shedding the burden of being the face of the Orioles franchise, Machado has been making headlines for not hustling, dubious sliding, deliberate tripping and crotch grabbing, all in the space of a few days. He’ll be a free agent after this series, so before he makes the ultimate heel move – signing with the Yankees in the offseason – it seems an inevitable part of the narrative that he will be either the hero or the villain of the series. Dodgers to win in seven.The numbers all point to a World Series win for the Red Sox and so do the contents of my carefully-tended bag of petty grievances.As a Brit learning a new sport in a new land, it didn’t take long to import the old ways. Forget knowledge of the infield fly rule or time spent meditating on box scores – you only know you have truly sunk to the level of proper fan when your irrational hatred of other teams or players reveals itself and ruins the pleasure of watching top-level sport. The bitter neutral is compelled to waste energy hoping to see old rivals suffer.Clayton Kershaw may be a wonderful pitcher, and may come off as a modest nice guy in interviews, but that is not going to make up for October 2016 when he seemed to throw every pitch in every game to send the Washington Nationals home early from the playoffs.Justin Turner may have a flaming beard worthy of the free folk in Game of Thrones, but it does not burn bright enough to eclipse the memory of him slapping a two-run triple over Trea Turner’s head at Nationals Park.The Red Sox were the best team in baseball this season by a long way and deserve to win it all, but really, for all the wrong reasons, it’s anyone but Dodgers. Red Sox to win in five."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8933379a0017e1d3bdbf19df64c9792b2edea8a3/7_0_3487_2093/master/3487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d7b112c31e84c672f1515432ba249f","title":"christian wade bulk sizeist premiership england","story":"Wasps’ elusive wing is heading for the US as rugby in England, for whom he won a single cap, gets ever more size-istPeople love rugby union for different reasons. Some relish the contact, the physical challenge, the survival-of-the-fittest mentality. Others cherish the ethos of unselfishness, the camaraderie and the dressing‑room humour. Spending an entire 80 minutes with one’s head, for example, wedged between two large pairs of buttocks encourages a perspective about fellowship and sacrifice that few other sports can match.What it has never been is a game for robots. Coaches like to talk about consistency and doing the basics but rugby’s real beauty ultimately lies in its quirks and uncertainties. The ball can bounce anywhere, it is not impossible for two ridiculously contrasting body shapes to find themselves in direct opposition. Size matters, of course, but so do evasiveness, trickery and imagination.Entrenched tribal loyalties aside, such free spirits sell more tickets than anything else the game can offer. Rugby rightly celebrates its monster trucks but, for maximum impact, it needs – beep beep! – its road runners as well. A big tackle or a powerfully driven maul will generate a visceral thrill but a little guy weaving in and out of heavy traffic, all of it intent on crushing him to a pulp, lends the sport its extra dimension.How ironic, then, that in the week the great Lions and Wales stand-off Phil Bennett turns 70, English rugby appears to be growing more size‑ist by the week. Everyone accepts players’ heads need protecting but red-carding slightly built creative fly-halves for the heinous crime of trying to slow down the snorting rhinos charging at them does not feel, for this particular branch of the entertainment business, much like progress.And then there is the saga of Christian Wade, who now wants to try his luck in American football having won a solitary cap for England. It is fair to say Wade has generated as much attacking electricity as anyone who has played Premiership rugby in the past decade but, for whatever reason, successive England coaches have decided his lack of poundage represents too great a risk.There was a time a couple of seasons ago when Wade was as unplayable as Jason Robinson or Shane Williams, who scored 90 Test tries between them. He would pop up where people would not expect and, by the time they realised, it was invariably too late. At 5ft 8in and 13st 5lb he is taller and weighs more than Williams, one of Wales’s modern greats.It would be lovely to think that, at 27, it is not too late for him to take a completely different sport, not to mention a continent, by storm. The odds are stacked against him but it will be fun watching him try when and if his contractual situation with Wasps is resolved. The Premiership, either way, will be a duller, more predictable place without him.That last sentence alone should be cause for concern among those responsible for growing the club game – or flogging it off to the highest bidder as it is now apparently known. A sport looking to reduce the number of damaging collisions surely needs to protect as many of its will-o’-the-wisps and space invaders as possible. Sadly, even in age-group rugby, almost the only positions where it is now feasible to pick such players is at 9, 15 or, at a stretch, 10 if they can kick well enough. Fly-halves who do not tackle like Owen Farrell, as we are now seeing, are starting to be seen as luxury items.The game is undoubtedly changing and some are being squeezed out. The increasing prevalence of the cross-kick has made it almost compulsory to field wings who can compete for a high ball without either being brushed away or easily out-jumped. It is only necessary to look at the dimensions of the youngest wing named in Eddie Jones’s autumn squad to receive a glimpse of the future. Joe Cokanasiga of Bath, aged 20, is 17st 6lb and almost 6ft 4in. His barnstorming early try against Wasps on Saturday was hugely impressive – only for Joe Simpson and Josh Bassett to outfox the young giant for a try down the blind side to prove there is more than one way to skin a big cat.Is there an easy answer to all this? Not really, short of giving one player on each side a special bib – which can be given only to iniduals below a certain size and weight – that requires anyone tackling them to make contact from waist level down only. Or, conceivably, embracing the idea of a collective weight limit for every matchday squad. Neither would have been remotely necessary a decade ago but Wade’s departure, whether born out of personal frustration or not, should concentrate minds. If rugby becomes a game solely for pre-programmed, muscular robots it will alienate a large chunk of its audience.There is no word yet as to whether Bruce Craig’s bid to have Bath’s opening European Champions Cup pool game against Toulouse replayed has gained any official traction. The game as a whole, it is fair to say, is not exactly holding its breath. But what if the organisers did somehow cave in, accept Bath’s argument there was a grievous time-keeping error and set a ludicrous precedent by allowing the game to be replayed with only two seconds left on the clock? It has happened before in US basketball in 2008, when the Atlanta Hawks and the Miami Heat were required to replay the last 51.9 seconds of their NBA game. Atlanta won without scoring a point. Bath may fancy their chances but there is also a significant risk attached – one crooked line-out throw would make them a worldwide laughing stock.England travel to Portugal this week for a warm-weather training camp before the autumn series. Their opening Test against South Africa will be less than 48 hours away by the time the players return, with the team also being formally announced in the Algarve. It is the first time an England team have deliberately sought to turn a non-World Cup game at Twickenham into an away fixture. Maybe they should give South Africa, who will have been based in London all week, the home dressing room."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfeceef1865a6954a4ddb55a2894da2e9346d00f/213_104_2345_1408/master/2345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0802e00c98a3543870080262fbd3b686","title":"sri lanka england fifth odi live cricket","story":"20th over: Sri Lanka 143-1 (Dickwella 78, Chandimal 4) So here’s Dinesh Chandimal, the captain. He’s been short of runs but he starts briskly, feeding off the confidence of the openers.Gone! “In sport, anything can happen,” says an advert, and Moeen has just proved it by bowling Samarawickrama, barely disturbing the bail, so there’s confusion all round, exacerbated when Buttler fumbles what might have been a stumping chance. But out it is: end of a fine innings, and an excellent opening stand.19th over: Sri Lanka 137-0 (Dickwella 73, Samarawickrama 54) Adil Rashid is playing in a different game, one in which England are still the top team in the world. In four overs, he has conceded only one four, whereas his teammates have gone for 18 in 15. 18th over: Sri Lanka 132-0 (Dickwella 73, Samarawickrama 54) Plunkett continues to suffer as Dickwella gets out the bludgeon (back over the bowler’s head) and then the feather-duster (a flick between the keeper and fine leg, who isn’t fine enough).Abhijato Sensarma is right back at me. “Thank you for answering my enquiries.” It’s a pleasure. “I’m a fifteen-year-old student and not a reporter :) but that good old a), b) and c) do get under my skin too because of their appearances on my question papers.” Ah yes, exams: journalism for kids. “As for the selection of five seamers, it is indeed quite baffling. Maybe one justification could be they wanted to give some game time to everyone (even though Denly’s spin should still be in the team, if he’s any good). Something tells me that if good old Mo gets enough purchase on the surface, Joe Root could be called in to bowl a long spell and keep the economy down.” I thought that was Brexit’s job. “At the moment, however, they must get through the openers. Even the edges are on Sri Lanka’s side today. Considering they have good finishers, their improvement in strike rotation is a pleasing sight. Maybe Jos needs to shed the gloves and take the wicket himself. After all, he is Superman, as he proved to Indian fans this summer!”17th over: Sri Lanka 122-0 (Dickwella 64, Samarawickrama 51) A fine over from Rashid, who beats Samarawickrama with the googly and would be asking for a review if this was a Test match. And that’s drinks, with Sri Lanka well on top, and showing themselves how they should have played the whole series.16th over: Sri Lanka 119-0 (Dickwella 62, Samarawickrama 51) With his fifty in the bag, and now his mate’s too, Dickwella starts having a laugh: a flick for four, a scoop for four more, both off Plunkett, who’s usually hard to get away. “Is it cowardly,” asks Bob O’Hara, “to pray for rain?” Nice one.15th over: Sri Lanka 107-0 (Dickwella 52, Samarawickrama 49) Several singles off Rashid, the first of which brings Dickwella a fine fifty.“To be honest,” says Dave Brown, “I can’t understand the Joe Denly pick, and I’m a Kent supporter. His average of just under 35 for the season isn’t exactly kicking the selectors’ door in. Yes, I know he bowls a bit of useful leg spin but surely this can’t be a deal clincher for a top-three batsman.” Not normally, but England’s Test team don’t have a top three at the moment – they have Cook who’s retired, Jennings who’s only still there because Cook’s retired, and Moeen filling in, manfully.14th over: Sri Lanka 101-0 (Dickwella 49, Samarawickrama 46) Liam Plunkett comes on, fresh from his honeymoon in America, part of which he spent bowling in a baseball diamond. Alone, we assume, though maybe his bride formed an audience of one, like Meghan for Harry at the Sydney Opera House. Plunkett almost persuades the batsmen to concoct a run-out, but Stokes can’t hit the stumps, and that’s the hundred partnership off 82 balls.13th over: Sri Lanka 94-0 (Dickwella 45, Samarawickrama 44) Buttler turns not to Stokes but to Adil Rashid, and as a captain he is attacking enough to post a slip – Morgan would approve. Tidy start from Rashid, but the batsmen are seeing it well and still pick up a couple of twos and a single.So, some answers for Abhijato, picking up on the previous over. (a) Hard to set a par score before a wicket falls, but I’d say 330. (b) Yes, some rust, but also some bad luck, a good pitch, and some very good batting. (c) As an Englishman, I don’t know much about Denly either. He’s the latest hunch from Ed Smith, the new national selector, who has done very well with Buttler and Sam Curran, and quite well with Rashid. Denly was picked for the Test tour, so that’s why he is waiting his turn today. But the five seamers do seem a strange decision.12th over: Sri Lanka 89-0 (Dickwella 43, Samarawickrama 41) Tom Curran goes for a few singles and a two. Stone the crows, there’s an email that is not from John Starbuck. “The strokemaking is entertaining by itself,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “but I must confess that I have turned up the volume of my telly just to enjoy the background music more. The crowd is really into it, and so am I! The festive music throughout the series adds to the uniqueness of cricket in Sri Lanka. One gets the feeling that the music will play long into the night if the Sri Lankans win today. “About a more pressing issue on my mind, however... Perhaps it’s too early to say, but (a) What looks like a par score on this pitch? (b) Has the English bowling been sporadic because of change in personnel, who would be understandably rusty, or is the pitch just too flat for their length to err slightly? (c) As an Indian, I don’t know much about Joe Denly how good is he, and in your opinion should he have been in the revamped line-up today?”Ah, the old (a), (b) and (c). Are you by any chance a journalist? Answers in a minute.11th over: Sri Lanka 83-0 (Dickwella 39, Samarawickrama 39) Moeen is getting some turn, and even a puff of dust, which doesn’t bode well for England’s innings. The Sri Lankans aren’t fazed. Dickwella plays a reverse sweep, nicely controlled, which deserves more than two Samarawickrama dances down the track to chip for four. What can Buttler do? Send for Stokes, maybe.10th over: Sri Lanka 72-0 (Dickwella 35, Samarawickrama 33) Tom Curran, showing his stomach for the fight, brings out his loopy slower-ball yorker, and comes close to befuddling Dickwella. Shades of the only ball Moeen has faced in this series, a lethally slow thing from Malinga. That’s a fine over, going for a mere two, but Sri Lanka still finish the Powerplay well on top.9th over: Sri Lanka 70-0 (Dickwella 34, Samarawickrama 32) Buttler, who may be wondering why on earth he agreed to have five seamers in his team, turns to spin, in the form of Moeen Ali. He manages to get through an over without a boundary.8th over: Sri Lanka 65-0 (Dickwella 30, Samarawickrama 31) Different Curran, same result. Tom replaces Sam, Samarawickrama chips him over cover, and Dickwella picks out the same spot with much the same shot, except that he’s a left-hander so cover has become midwicket. We’ve had 13 boundaries already, eight of them off the Currans, and this is now the highest opening stand of the series, for either side. The challenge for the batsmen is to turn it into a big one.7th over: Sri Lanka 55-0 (Dickwella 25, Samarawickrama 26) Dickwella lofts Wood for four over long leg, whips him for two, and then plays a delicious scoop for four more. The two brings up the 50 partnership off only 39 balls. It’s been one third streaky, two thirds superb.6th over: Sri Lanka 45-0 (Dickwella 15, Samarawickrama 26) Buttler keeps Sam Curran on, and Curran goes round the wicket. It almost works, as Samarawickrama plays with both his edges. A slash outside off should go for one or two, but Wood makes a hash of his e. A Harrow cut could easily clip leg stump, but instead flies to the rope. So Curran has figures of 3-0-27-0 when it could easily be 3-0-20-1.Just when you think nobody is ever going to email you again, up pops John Starbuck. “Going by the local weather forecasts,” he argues, “you’d expect the impending rain to influence conditions and allow plenty of swing for the quicks, but this seems not to be the case. Is there an even more local effect in Colombo or is it like that all over Sri Lanka? If the grass is dry rye there won’t be a lot of pace off the pitch either so why not use all the spin options? It used to work for India.”5th over: Sri Lanka 37-0 (Dickwella 15, Samarawickrama 18) Wood restores order for half an over, then Dickwella plays a flick-pull, rather unconvincingly, and a checked pull that is much more solid. Two more boundaries, and Sri Lanka, for once, are in charge.4th over: Sri Lanka 28-0 (Dickwella 7, Samarawickrama 18) Dickwella hits a four too, with the first contender for shot of the day, easing Curran through the covers. And suddenly the floodgates open. Samarawickrama plays a slog over cover, a far more elegant drive, and a crisp flick off the hip, all for four. That’s 17 off the over: wham, bam, thank you Sam.3rd over: Sri Lanka 11-0 (Dickwella 2, Samarawickrama 6) Wood finds his radar, and with it the edge of Samarawickrama’s bat – but the ball goes wide of the two slips and Wood’s pace propels it to the rope. Which spoils what might have been a maiden.2nd over: Sri Lanka 7-0 (Dickwella 2, Samarawickrama 2) Buttler hands the other new ball to Sam Curran, not Tom. The two of them become the first brothers to play for England since the Hollioakes, also from Surrey, also great to watch. Sam celebrates by beating Dickwella with a beauty, curling away and nipping back off the seam.1st over: Sri Lanka 5-0 (Dickwella 1, Samarawickrama 1) It’s Mark Wood to get the party started. He races in off his new longer run-up... and bowls a wide. His second ball is better, swinging back into Dickwella’s off stump, and going for a single off a thick inside edge. Another single, another wide, and finally a couple of dots. Wood is flying in his follow-through – he just needs to get away from the left-hander’s pads.Lasith Malinga, who started this series in style, is rested. His place goes to Lakshan Sandakan, who’s a bit different – a left-arm wrist spinner.Eoin Morgan, the man of the series by a mile, is so good he decides to rest himself, so Jos Buttler captains England today. He calls wrong and Dinesh Chandimal takes first use of what looks like a good pitch. Buttler says he would have bowled anyway, “with a bit of weather around”.England play a game of musical seamers: Liam Plunkett, Mark Wood and Sam Curran come in for Woakes, Stone and Morgan, so the Currans appear together for the first time in an international, and Buttler has seven bowlers up his sleeve.That’s enough questions. Play starts at 10am UK time, so I’ll bring you the toss and the teams in about a quarter of an hour. In the meantime, do email me.Morning everyone and welcome to the fifth and final one-day international in Colombo. Is this match (a) a bit of a drag, as a sodden series turns into a dead rubber (b) a bit of an experiment, as we establish whether England’s best-ever one-day team can still win on DLS with a cast of understudies, or (c) a bit of a laugh, as Joe Denly hopes to return to international cricket after a 383-match lay-off?Actually, no rubber can ever be pronounced dead, as Alastair Cook and Jimmy Anderson showed in the Oval Test. There are always some live issues. Can Sri Lanka, who have gone from the bottom of ODI cricket to the top and back again, find their way? Can Mark Wood touch 90mph again and see off Olly Stone? Can Moeen Ali face a ball in this series without getting out? Can England field both the Curran brothers at once, or are they, in fact, the same fresh-faced young man, bowling right-arm in one-dayers and left-arm in Tests?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0434f5f7a9037531c2cdf84ac07c653873c130b4/0_197_4456_2674/master/4456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abc0471ff735a6557d583157767ad2d","title":"sundowning review dementia tristan bates theatre london","story":"Tristan Bates theatre, London Hazel Maycock is superb in a moving family tale crammed with feeling and insightDementia is a heartbreaker. It’s also a nightmare to stage: repetitive, meandering and often deeply boring. But dementia will touch so many of us, and it’s important to create plays that explore this condition with unflinching compassion. Sundowning does just that. It’s wildly uneven but it is also heartfelt and honest, and Hazel Maycock is devastating as dementia-sufferer Betty.Nessah Muthy’s own grandmother had dementia, and you can feel that first-hand experience and deeply felt pain in her writing. Ironically, it’s the dementia that makes the most sense in Helena Bell’s shaky production. There’s a laboured subplot about an estranged granddaughter, Alyssa, just released from prison, and her put-upon aunt Teresa, but these scenes feel brittle and unconvincing. It’s the encounters between Alyssa (a sparky Aasiya Shah) and grandma Betty that linger and burn they’re relatively free of plot but crammed with feeling and insight.Muthy nails the way sensory experiences can burst through the dementia haze. Against the backdrop of Daniel Denton’s melting projections, as if the weather itself is sliding away, Betty and Alyssa dance and sing together. They enjoy the smell of moisturiser, the feel of a hug or the taste of a wine gum – all those pure pleasures that dementia cannot erode.The play hints at the violence the condition can provoke in others (Betty’s body is covered in bruises), and the powerful hold the past has over the present (she talks obsessively with her dead husband). Muthy also explores one of dementia’s stranger side-effects: an incredibly high sex-drive. In one truthful but hard-to-believe moment, Betty reaches inside her nightie and masturbates in front of her granddaughter. The temptation is to look away.

If only it came with USB-C The Surface Laptop 2 is Microsoft’s ultimate vision of what a Windows 10 laptop should be – simple, sleek and sophisticated, but still a little different.The look, feel and operation hasn’t changed since last year, save for a slick new black paint job, which joins the default Microsoft silver, burgundy and blue.The top shell is smooth aluminium with rounded corners and the polished Microsoft logo inlaid in the centre. It’s a very simple look that is surprisingly different to most other laptops.Open it up and you realise the keyboard deck is too. Covered in colour-matched Alcantara, the deck has a soft-touch fabric texture, feeling much warmer and inviting than metal or plastic, contrasting with the smooth aluminium lid. It’s good look that’s different to pretty much anything else on the market.A large precision trackpad sits in the middle of the palm rests, below Microsoft’s brilliant keyboard. It’s well spaced, has excellent key feel and a good amount of travel. Both the keyboard and the trackpad are not exactly silent, but the typing experience is far quieter than some competitor machines.The 13.5in high resolution touchscreen is just as beautiful as last year’s, and with the super quick startup and Windows Hello face recognition it makes it a joy to open. It’s definitely one of those machines that begs for a really good desktop background.The bezels around the screen, although not massive, are larger than the competition this year, particularly Huawei’s MateBook X Pro and Dell’s XPS 13.At 14.5mm thick it’s marginally slimmer than the competition with the Huawei MateBook X Pro 14.6mm thick and Apple’s MacBook Pro 14.9mm thick. It’s also slightly lighter at 1.25kg to 1.33 and 1.37kg respectively.In a bag it’s a bit more noticeable than the Surface Pro 6, but still light enough to carry around without too many complaints.The Surface Laptop 2 has been updated with Intel’s latest eighth-generation Core i5 and i7 processors, which are significantly more powerful thanks to being quad-core rather than dual-core and more power efficient.As such even the black Core i5 version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage performed very well indeed. Supporting two external 1080p displays connected to the optional Surface Dock, and the internal laptop screen without breaking a sweat.From large image manipulation jobs in Affinity Photo to running 30 tabs in Chrome and any office or media duty you could think of the Surface Laptop 2 flew though it all. The laptop does have a fan for cooling, but it’s so quiet you could be forgiven for thinking it was entirely fanless.The only duties the Surface Laptop 2 might struggle with are graphics related, as its integrated Intel UHD 620 chip is definitely the weak point – hardcore gaming and multiple 4K video editing are probably out.Battery life was excellent, consistently lasting around 10 hours of working, enough to get through a full work day, watch a movie on the way home and still have some left in the tank.That was while using Chrome with about 10 tabs open most of the day, using Nextgen Reader, Mail, Evernote, Typora, Affinity Photo and Netflix, with recommended brightness and battery setting (Better Battery).The first generation of Surface Laptop shipped last year with relatively old connectivity options. Sadly the Surface Laptop 2 ships with the same outdated ports.It has a USB-A port, which is certainly welcome, a headphone socket, and the Surface Connector, which is a magnetic power cable that can double as a docking port with the sold-separately Surface Dock.But the Surface Laptop 2 lacks any USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 ports, having only a mini DisplayPort for connecting monitors. It is a bizarre choice that doesn’t make sense in 2018. Practically nothing ships with a mini DisplayPort cable, so you’ll need to either buy a dongle or a new cable like you would with a USB-C port, but you also can’t use it for anything other than connecting a monitor, so it lacks the added universal utility USB-C offers.Last year’s model shipped with Windows 10 S, which could be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro at no cost. For the Surface Laptop 2 Microsoft has ditched S Mode entirely, instead shipping it with regular Windows 10 Home out of the box.On paper that may seem like a downgrade, as to run Windows 10 Pro on it costs £120 from the Microsoft Store. But Windows 10 Home only really lacks enterprise networking, domain joining and BitLocker. It still has device encryption to protect your data if the laptop gets stolen, so most users won’t even notice the difference.As with all Microsoft machines, all updates, including firmware and driver updates, are delivered straight through Windows Update, meaning there are no other utilities, support programs or bloat to deal with.The laptop is available in platinum in all configurations or black, burgundy or cobalt blue in the Core i5 or i7 configurations with 256GB of storage.The Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 is arguably the finest example of what a Windows laptop should be. It is beautiful, simple, powerful and well made. It works better than most of the competition, from super quick startup to seamless all-in-one update management. And in black it induces envy in those around you.In many ways the Surface Laptop 2 is the spiritual successor to Apple’s MacBook Air – the relatively affordable, yet premium-made machine most people should buy that just works well for what most people want to do.Sadly it is hampered by old ports. A couple of years ago USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 were the future, but now they’re just the present. Anything that doesn’t have at least one USB-C port is unnecessarily behind the times.Still, at around £1,000 the Surface Laptop 2 is still a brilliant machine with a first-class experience, if you can get over the lack of modern ports.Cons: no USB-C, no SD card reader, no fingerprint scanner, limited configuration options, Windows 10 Home not Pro, only Intel UHD 620 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Better transport links, new hotels and a growing number of activities were cited as the reason the south-Asian island was chosen for the top spot in the guidebook publisher ’s annual Best in Travel awards.“Already notable to intrepid travellers for its mix of religions and cultures, its timeless temples, its rich and accessible wildlife, its growing surf scene and its people who defy all odds by their welcome and friendliness after decades of civil conflict, this is a country revived,” says Lonely Planet author Ethan Gelber in the Best in Travel 2019 book, published today.“Unmissable experiences” include wildlife, such as the 300-strong elephant gathering at Minneriya national park, thousand-year old Buddhist monuments, and hiking and train travel through the Hill Country’s tea plantations.Tourist visits to Sri Lanka have increased dramatically since the end of the 26-year conflict, from 447,890 in 2009 to an all time high of 2.1 million last year, a figure the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority hopes to double by 2020. Renovations made to the rail system have opened up Jaffna and much of north for the first time since 1990 – an area that was previously considered too dangerous for tourists. The scenic rail routes in Sri Lanka are now widely thought to be some of the best in the world. Motorways have also been built as far south as Matara, and the number of domestic flight routes has increased in recent years, too: for instance, from the capital Colombo, on the east coast, to Batticaloa, on the opposite of the island, in 45 minutes. There has also been a huge investment in new visitor accommodation: from homestays to high-end eco retreats – such as the Wild Coast Lodge’s cocoon-like buildings in Yala national park. Major international hotel chains, including Shangri-La, Mövenpick, Sheraton, and Grand Hyatt, are all opening new properties.Sri Lanka’s surf scene has been steadily growing, as more of the coast has become accessible, and tour operators are now offering jungle hiking, alongside yoga breaks with traditional Ayurveda treatments. There are also plenty of free attractions, including colourful puja rituals on the clifftop of Koneswaram Kovil in Trincomalee in the north east Colombo’s main market of Pettah and the fortified walls surrounding the colonial old town of Galle in the south.While the ratio of tourists to residents is relatively low compared with countries where overtourism is now a major issue, some conservationists have expressed concern over the speed of development in certain areas.“To accommodate the numbers, we are building more hotels and infrastructure and taking over natural spaces. The pressure on our wildlife and cultural sites is immense and destructive. The over-development is ongoing and unending – and because of the lack of coordination and planning, many hotels lie empty. So while tourism has its positives, if done haphazardly and without planning you destroy the very resources that draw people in.”De Vos says development is affecting coastal areas and national parks in particular, where capacity is being exceeded in peak season and has led to an increase in pollution from rubbish not being disposed of properly. She believes tourism in Sri Lanka can be beneficial but says the government needs to regulate, educate, have a longer-term vision and protect areas from over-development. “Sustainability should be at the core of any tourism product that is created.” Human rights charities have also criticised large-scale tourism developments for their negative impact on local people.Lonely Planet’s Best in Travel lists the top 10 countries, cities and regions alongside other travel experiences for the year ahead, ranked by the staff of Lonely Planet, including editors and contributors from around the world. Germany is rated second in the countries list, with a nod to the centenary of Bauhaus next year, and Zimbabwe – where tourists are starting to return after the resignation of Robert Mugabe – comes in third. In fifth position is Kyrgyzstan, which has 2,700km of newly-marked trekking routes. Copenhagen, Shenzhen in China and Nova Sad in Serbia were named as the best cities to travel to in 2019, while top trends include dark-skies tourism (with an increase in people stargazing and solar eclipse trips) and electric road trips, thanks to a rise in the number of car-rental companies offering alternatives to petrol and diesel vehicles.For the full list of winners, visit lonelyplanet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e844545650f71443c872950e41a08c2d2d596169/0_0_4285_2571/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df69c70dce5b3e2194e4be087ca2985d","title":"strictly come dancing bbc denies fixing allegation after seann walsh survives","story":"DJ Vick Hope, who was voted off Strictly Come Dancing this weekend, said she witnessed a ‘very strange’ conversation between the producers and judges before the comedian was savedThe BBC has “categorically” denied an accusation that it fixed the result of Strictly Come Dancing after Seann Walsh and his dance partner, Katya Jones, were kept in the competition by the judges’ vote.The DJ Vick Hope, who was voted off the show on Saturday, complained about producers and the judging panel consulting before giving their verdicts on the Sunday night results show.Hope told Capital FM that she witnessed the judging panel – guest judge Alfonso Ribeiro, Darcey Bussell, Shirley Ballas and Craig Revel Horwood – having a “very strange” conversation with producers before she was voted off along with her dance partner Graziano Di Prima.“It was very strange, because after the dance-off the judges have to give their decisions, but there was a bit of a conflab with some producers and then they gave their decisions,” she said. “It was just stunned silence in the studio, it was a really weird atmosphere.”The BBC responded by reiterating that the judging panel operates independently and that the conversation Hope witnessed was about the logistics of the voting process.“It is categorically untrue to imply that producers tell the judges how to score or who to save,” read the statement.“Each judge votes on each dance independently, based on its merits and in their expert opinion alone. The judges use an electronic voting pad to transmit their score or choice of who to save to the production gallery, which is then locked in and cannot be changed.“Only after this does a producer speak to the judges, advising them on how long they have to speak and reminding them to give a reason for their decisions. The process was exactly the same this weekend.”Walsh and Jones became embroiled in a tabloid scandal after they were photographed kissing outside a pub in London. They were both in long-term relationships.Jones offered an apology and said the incident “didn’t reflect on her marriage”, while Walsh released a statement calling the kiss a “one-off drunken mistake”.Walsh was also accused of “gaslighting” after his ex-girlfriend Rebecca Humphries said that he dismissed her questions about his relationship with Jones and “aggressively, and repeatedly, called me a psychonutsmental”.Strictly posted season-high viewing figures the week after the scandal broke, with 9.9 million people tuning in to see Walsh and Jones survive the dance-off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832014b0bdcc535013dd1357f4757e61cce568fc/0_71_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce6d81a4eb28ff08565f9cdee795aea9","title":"top gears new roguish cheeky chappies could be its last hope","story":"Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff could revolutionise what it means to be a car-loving man in the 21st century – or take the show back to its toxic pastRemember when we used to care about who would be the new hosts of Top Gear? It feels like a lifetime ago. I have fuzzy memories of red-faced men tearfully delivering pro-Clarkson petitions to Broadcasting House in a tank, but, honestly, I’m not entirely sure it wasn’t an Armando Iannucci sketch that I’m misremembering as a news story. The fact that the new frontmen were announced without even a hint of a military coup against the BBC shows how far the stock of the show fell under Evans and Matt LeBlanc. In a way, I’m sad that the Top Gear producers have ended the “radio DJ plus American 90s sitcom star” hosting experiment: I was looking forward to a Ken BruceNewman from Seinfeld combo, or, my personal favourite, Jo WhileyNiles from Frasier.Instead, they have gone for 2002’s Paddy McGuinness (whose catchphrase “no likey, no lighty” encourages a flagrant disregard for traffic signals) and cricketer turned professional banter-man Andrew “Freddie” Flintoff, who seemingly won over the BBC after his Top Gear meets Robot Wars mashup series, Carnage. In short, it’s not a staggeringly inspired choice.What’s more depressing, however, is that the hiring of McGuinness and Flintoff means that there apparently isn’t space for charismatic car expert, Rory Reid. Instead, he has been demoted to presenting the companion show, which is like your boss replacing your company car Ferrari with a 2005 Mazda 3 with the words “Ferrari Extra” scrawled on it. It’s hard not to feel sorry for Reid, and it’s hard not to read this as a very conscious attempt by the Top Gear higher-ups to pivot away from the ersity and expertise of the LeBlanc season, and back to the undeniably “laddy” atmosphere of the Clarkson, Hammond and May days, with its tanksand presenter tantrums.At the heart of this decision is an existential question about Top Gear that has been haunting the show, and the BBC, since before 2015 and Clarkson’s departure. What is Top Gear, and why was it so popular? On the surface, it’s a show about cars – how fast they go, what colours they are, what noises they make when you rev the engines. But clearly, that’s not really what the show is about, because cars are kind of boring. Eight million people weren’t tuning in every Sunday night to find out what kind of noise an Aston Martin made, otherwise my pitch to ITV, Sit-Down Lawnmowers and What Noises They Make, would have been commissioned for an eight-part series.The show morphed into something else under Clarkson, Hammond and May – for better or worse, it stopped being a show about cars and became a show that merely used cars as vague props in a celebration of the excesses of toxic masculinity. The bullying dynamic of their friendship, the dismissal of other cultures that weren’t explicitly for old white British men – these things became the core of the show, the thing that pulled audiences in. It wasn’t a car show that survived despite this political incorrectness – it was a politically incorrect show that survived despite the fact that it was about cars.When the BBC tried in 2015 to rebrand Top Gear as something for everyone – after all, women and ethnic minorities drive cars too, you know – it didn’t understand the gross, inherently reactive appeal of the show. It’s for men. Men who think ice-cream is gay, men who use racist epithets while travelling around Vietnam, men who like to call Mexicans lazy and feckless, men who allegedly punch producers when they don’t get a hot meal. The last three years of Evans and LeBlanc seem to have proved that Top Gear can’t be detoxified, because no-one wants it without the toxicity.It’s impossible to know what tone the new show might take – McGuinness and Flintoff might manage to be roguish cheeky chappies who also manage to be culturally sensitive. Who knows, they could revolutionise what it means to be a car-loving man in the 21st century, and prove that you can be in touch with your emotions and the gearbox at the same time. If the show reverts back to the cruel laddish “humour” of the past, however, it might be time for the BBC to quietly take it off the road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

In Riyadh, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, will open an investment showpiece declaring the kingdom open for business. In Ankara, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is expected to make a speech that may well shut down the beleaguered kingdom.Such are the stakes when Erdoğan takes to a podium to discuss the death of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi that the region may not be the same when he’s finished.Three weeks to the day since Khashoggi vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Erdoğan has pledged to table the “naked truth” about what happened to the columnist and critic, whose fate continues to grip both countries and polarise the Middle East.If he stays true to his pledge, much of the evidence that Turkey has gathered, incriminating Saudi Arabia in a plot to kill Khashoggi, will be revealed: in pictures, video and even bloodcurdling audio said to document his torture and death.Setting the scene on Monday, a spokesman for the ruling party for the first time described Khashoggi’s death as a “complicated murder” that was “monstrously planned”.That Erdoğan, not his bureaucrats, is now prepared to put his name to the material takes this extraordinary event to a new level. The Turkish strongman is expected to accuse the inner sanctum of power in Riyadh of organising a hit on Khashoggi, directly contradicting its claims that state officers had acted beyond their authority in an attempt to please their masters.Such an allegation carries with it a weight not yet seen in Riyadh, where blanket early denials had first given way to begrudging disclosures, then partial admissions, cover-ups and fall guys. Dread is the order of the day, as the already-troubled investment conference looms. And in some quarters of the royal court, a palpable sense of panic has taken hold.Erdoğan has the Saudis – in particular, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (AKA MbS) – right where he wants him. Out of crisis has come opportunity for the veteran Turkish leader, who has never warmed to the brash 33-year-old, and thinks even less of his regional allies.The two men have vastly different visions for the future of the region: Erdoğan has been a champion of political Islam both at home and abroad, particularly since the rise and fall of Mohamed Morsi, the ill-fated former president of Egypt who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood. The Turkish president has partnered with Qatar, Riyadh’s regional foe, given shelter to those exiled after Morsi fell, and remained a bulwark for a movement that Riyadh and its ally the United Arab Emirates see as existential threats.But he has remained on the losing end of the struggle for regional power and influence.The prince, meanwhile, has been attempting to remodel Saudi Arabia, eschewing its deep links to the Wahhabi, Salafi religious establishment and turning it into an Arab nationalist police state. Abu Dhabi and Cairo are models here. And with Riyadh, the triumvirate had been in the ascendant regionally, ever since Morsi fell.For Erdoğan, the gruesome killing marks a historic moment: a chance to turn the tables gifted to him by a cruel and reckless act that has sparked lasting revulsion, even among the kingdom’s allies.“Erdoğan sees an opportunity in the Khashoggi murder – in that he realises MbS has become the weakest link in the anti-Erdoğan, anti-Muslim Brotherhood corner of the region. This is really thin ice that MbS is dancing on and I think Erdoğan is attempting to make it even thinner.Senior Saudis who sought solace from Erdoğan in Ankara in the past fortnight left town believing he had an even bigger prize in sight – relaunching Turkey as a regional Islamic power base, while diminishing Riyadh’s claim to be the pre-eminent voice for Sunni Islam.Khaled al-Faisal, the governor of Mecca, returned after seeing Erdoğan and was really worried, one senior member of the royal family has revealed. “He wasn’t budging, he didn’t want to listen to anything we said. Al-Faisal came back and told the King we have a crisis.”Çağaptay believes Erdoğan’s goals are more limited – for now. “He wants not to go after the Saudi royal family, to whom he’s deferential, including the King. What he’s trying to get out of this is to sideline, or maybe even neutralise MbS at least when it comes to Turkey. He wants to take one of his opponents out of that triple entente that opposes him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/972fe7f8a275c3d9e150f9c41f5361568356e93d/0_67_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=153e46d0731c024bf94c5a756ad2aee8","title":"a sea change how one small island showed us how to save our oceans","story":"In just 10 years, the Isle of Man has rid its beaches of plastic and earned Unesco status as a world leader in ocean protection. So how did it do it?Standing on a windswept beach on the north-west coast of the Isle of Man, Bill Dale looked out on to plastic bottles, cartons and packaging forming a thick carpet covering the shingle. It was 2007, the global plastic binge was already well under way, but the millions of tonnes of waste seeping into the oceans as a consequence had not reached the public consciousness.“I was with a friend and we thought, ‘Let’s just clean up this one beach.’ We had no idea then of the scale of the problem.”It took six weekends, working long hours, to collect all the plastic litter. “We shifted 30,000 plastic bottles and large pieces of plastic,” said Dale. “You would pick one piece up, and underneath was another and another in layers. Some of the stuff went back 20 years.”Today, as Dale stands outside an Edwardian summerhouse in the west of the island at Niarbyl bay, he believes Manx beaches are the cleanest in Europe. But the regular sweeps of the 100-mile coastline, conducted by his charity Beach Buddies, are just one facet of the island’s approach to ocean protection that makes it a global leader.In the charity’s visitors’ book, alongside comments from schoolchildren, teachers and parents, there is a signature that stands out: that of Dr Han Qunli, a senior figure within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). It was after his visit that the Isle of Man joined the likes of Mauritius, Menorca, Jeju in South Korea and Noosa in Australia in being singled out for a commitment to protecting and enhancing the coastal environment and bioersity.The island’s determination to protect the coastal environment from the multiple threats of plastic pollution, climate change and overfishing has earned it the status of a Unesco biosphere region, designated because it is an outstanding example of a place where people and nature work in harmony. It is the only entire island jurisdiction to be granted the status.Now a marine scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Agriculture in the Isle of Man government, she heralds the steps being taken on the island as proof that all is not entirely lost.Looking out over Ramsey Bay, which in 2011 became a marine nature reserve covering 94 sq km, Gell points out the location of seagrass beds, horse mussel reefs and maerl beds that are once again thriving. “Seagrass has declined globally in a really scary way, particularly in the UK, since the 1920s,” said Gell. “It looks like a green meadow under the sea and has a really high level of carbon storage. It is also really important for juvenile scallops.”Each marine feature being protected and enhanced by the reserve creates erse habitats that allow scallops, juvenile cod, lobster and other fish to thrive. And while in many areas the fishing industry finds itself at loggerheads with environmentalists, fishing businesses on the Isle of Man – which fish for king and queen scallops, brown crab, lobster and whelk – have been involved in drawing up the protective marine belt around the island, even if some had to be heavily persuaded at first of the case for the protection zone.Dr David Beard, chief executive of the Manx Fish Producers Organisation, is also a marine biologist. “Back in 2009, Ramsey Bay had been overfished, there was very little stock left in there and the industry volunteered that area to be closed for a period of time,” he said.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe bay encompasses one of the most restricted fishing areas in the coastal waters, where dredging or trawling for scallops is banned throughout the year, except for two weeks before Christmas when up to 30 boats are allowed to go out. Each year the fishermen carry out a stock survey, so by the time they are allowed to fish they know the location of the highest quantities of scallops.“They get the highest value for the least impact,” said Beard. “It is a very low-carbon action because they know where to go and they are allowed to trawl for 20 minutes maximum, and it means there is less impact on the seabed. The fishermen know that if they destroy the seabed by overfishing you prevent the spat from settling, so you destroy the fishing, and it is a vicious circle.”Gell has been instrumental in trying to bring the public and fishing industry along with the conservation efforts. “We are trying not to impose from the top,” she said. “Each marine protected area comes from a lot of engagement with the local people. We go out all over the island to villages and towns and hold stakeholder meetings, with maps to discuss why an area needs to be protected, and to involve people and bring them onboard. It is a slow process but when I look back to 2008 and see what we have achieved I think it shows that people working together in communities can make a difference.“We have to stay optimistic. From my experience here over the past 10 years, I think we have shown people can get involved in a real community approach and can make a change.”As one of 52 Unesco island and coastal biosphere areas, the Isle of Man is focusing now with partners in Menorca, the Males, the Philippines and other islands on eliminating single-use plastic from their shores.If that eventually puts Bill Dale out of a job, he could not be happier.• This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The bridge will open to traffic on Wednesday.As well as being the longest bridge of its type, stretching 55km, the $20bn Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge is also one of the world’s most unusual roadways, with cameras to detect yawning, drivers forced to wear heart monitors and access restricted to the political elite and charity donors. Here are five things you need to know about the crossing:As drivers cross the bridge their heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored. The information will be sent to the bridge’s control centre. Hong Kong media have also reported there will be cameras monitoring drivers as they cross the bridge. If a driver yawns more than three times in 20 seconds, the “yawn cam” will raise an alert.Though the bridge aims to bring the autonomous regions of Hong Kong and Macau closer to mainland China, it will be accessible only to a select few.People from Hong Kong will need special permits to drive across the bridge. There are reports that long-term permits to cross from Hong Kong to Zhuhai will be granted to people who meet strict criteria, such as paying significant taxes in China, donating large amounts of money to charities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, or those who are members of one of several political organisations. Others can take a private shuttle bus. There is no public transport on the bridge.Online commenters in Hong Kong have complained about the bridge’s restricted access. “Such a huge investment using the Hong Kong taxpayer’s money... yet basically it is not open to us at all,” said one comment on the South China Morning Post website.Pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu described the bridge as a “politically driven mega-project without urgent need.” Another bridge is being built between nearby Shenzhen and Zhongshan, just north of Zhuhai, meaning that by 2030 traffic is predicted to drop significantly on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge. “Basically it is redundant,” he said.In Hong Kong and Macau, drivers travel on the left, in mainland China, drivers travel on the right, presenting a bit of a conundrum for the bridge.Since the bridge is considered mainland Chinese territory, drivers will have to travel on the right for the length of the crossing, and Hong Kong drivers will also have to “comply with the laws and regulations of the mainland” while on it, according to the city’s transport department.While creative solutions were put forward about how to handle the side swap, including a “flipper bridge” called the Pearl River Necklace proposed by a team of Dutch architects, a less exciting approach was chosen in the end, with cars stopping and changing sides at a specially built merge point before they drive onto the bridge in Hong Kong.The bridge is part of a campaign to connect Hong Kong and Macau to 11 Chinese cities to form a high-tech region to rival Silicon Valley, the Greater Bay Area. It is also the second major infrastructure project tying Hong Kong to mainland China to launch in a matter of weeks after the opening of a high-speed rail link last month.Critics say the multi-billion dollar bridge is an attempt to integrate Hong Kong into China as fears grow that the city’s cherished freedoms are being eroded. Both Hong Kong and Macau are part of China, but are special administrative regions, which have their own governments, legal systems, and policies. There are concerns this bridge is a sign of Beijing’s desire to bring the regions more firmly under its control."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4b3e933cf2cc0e4e0806d224731bbd746de52a/0_67_2726_1635/master/2726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59b19ed0fa2e776021fcc16cb7c9e5c5","title":"polands first openly gay politician says progressives can win","story":"After losses for ruling Law and Justice party in local elections Robert Biedroń says Poland is ‘ready for progressive politics’Poland’s first openly gay politician has said “progressives” can win in the country, as the ruling Law and Justice party suffered setbacks in local elections at the weekend.“I don’t believe that Poland is not ready for progressive politics,” said Robert Biedroń, who stood down as mayor of Słupsk to launch a pro-European, “pro-democratic” movement. “Because if you give people a tempting, credible offer, people are willing to trust you.”Having launched his unnamed movement last month, Biedroń’s first electoral test will be European elections next May, followed by Poland’s parliamentary elections later in the year and presidential elections in 2020.He faces an uphill struggle to turn around the fortunes of the left, which has no seats in the Sejm, the lower house of parliament.He is seen as a contender on the national stage, after one opinion poll put him in third place for the presidency behind the incumbent, Andrzej Duda, and the former prime minister Donald Tusk, who is believed to be eyeing a return to Polish politics at the end of his stint as European council president.Biedroń, who eschews the labels left and right, has been called “the Polish Macron” but his political manifesto is not yet complete.Perhaps like the French president, Biedroń does not want to avoid values. He argues that the Polish left collapsed at the polls because it pursued a technocratic path that ceded questions of history, identity and belonging to PiS. He levels the same charge at the centre-right Civic Platform led by Tusk, which he contends lost touch during eight years of running Poland. “They were building airports but they were closing small schools,” he said. “They ignored the local and that is why the populists grew up, because they said we will bring it back.”He plans to visit 40 small towns and villages before the end of the year and argues it is a myth that these places always vote for conservative parties. “You just need to find someone credible and accountable to articulate their dreams.”His own political trajectory, as a young, openly gay atheist and former LGBT activist who was elected to the Sejm in 2011, testifies to a modern Poland that is more nuanced than the common view of the Catholic country held by many, he argues.When Biedroń was an MP he was beaten up in the street four or five times, but by the time he was mayor people smiled in the streets, he has previously told the BBC. While he argues that Poland is “not black and white” on social issues, he concedes that life can be very difficult for gay people without his profile. “The LGBT community was a scapegoat for many politicians,” he said.Filip Pazderski, an analyst at the Institute of Public Affairs in Warsaw, said Biedroń had a chance to pick up votes from the one-fifth of Polish voters estimated to lean left, especially younger people sceptical of politics and those motivated by quality of life in their local area. “People are fed up with the old political actors,” Pazderski said, adding that Biedroń knew “how to talk with people and use social media”.But the analyst thought it unlikely Biedroń could ever be prime minister without support from other parties.For now Biedroń is allying with pro-EU forces associated with Emmanuel Macron. He said he was in talks with the French president as well as Udo Bullmann, the leader of the socialists in the European parliament.Biedroń is seeking a radical change in Poland’s relationship with the EU, which is dominated by a bitter dispute over the rule of law. Biedroń accused past Polish governments of treating the EU like a “milk cow” whose only value was transactional.Brussels insiders are increasingly alarmed that Poland’s populist government may instruct the supreme court to ignore the European court of justice, a move that would be seen as an attack on the foundation of the EU.It remains unclear whether the Polish government intends to comply with a ruling issued on Friday ordering Poland to suspend a law lowering the retirement age of judges.Many of the supreme court judges affected by the law are returning to work after Europe’s highest court said it was intervening to avoid “serious and irreparable damage to the EU” while it considered its final verdict on the matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a80c7ed8f036f6918a07f90b69710216112f329a/302_156_1520_912/master/1520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f80e75fc874cc16350dc977a606525","title":"tuesday briefing nefarious of khashoggi","story":"Turkish president poised to explode Saudi denials … ancient Greek ship found intact a mile underwater … and why gratitude feels good on paperHello, it’s Warren Murray putting you in the picture on Tuesday morning.“Nothing will remain secret,” an aide to Turkey’s president has promised, as Recep Tayyip Erdoğan prepares for an explosive speech alleging the Saudi government murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Turkish soil. In the latest of a steady flow of leaks from Turkish authorities, CCTV footage has emerged showing a Saudi “body double” leaving the consulate and wandering Istanbul in Khashoggi’s clothes and a fake beard to make it look like he was still alive.Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, is said to have Skyped in to gloat during the last moments of Khashoggi’s life – telling the journalist’s captors to “bring me the head of the dog”. Erdoğan has the chance in his speech at Turkey’s parliament to reveal details of an audio recording said to exist of the moments of Khashoggi’s death and dismemberment. Erdoğan’s spokesman Ömer Çelik vowed Turkey would continue to expose how the “nefarious murder” of Khashoggi was “planned in an extremely savage manner … there has been a lot of effort to whitewash this”.The White House has continued frantic efforts to reduce the fallout for Saudi Arabia. Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner said he had told crown prince Salman “to be fully transparent. The world is watching.”Erdoğan is due to speak at 11.45am (0845 GMT).

Glasgow council said all early years establishments, additional support for learning (ASL) schools and mainstream primary schools would close on both days of the strike, while all mainstream secondary schools would remain open. Home care services for around 6,000 people are expected to be affected. Unions say workers in female-dominated roles such as cleaning and catering have been paid up to £3 an hour less than those in male-dominated jobs like waste collection.Still ship shape – Archaeologists have found what they believe to be the world’s oldest intact shipwreck: a probably Greek vessel thought to have lain at the bottom of the Black Sea for more than 2,400 years.“This will change our understanding of shipbuilding and seafaring in the ancient world,” said Professor Jon Adams from the Black Sea Maritime Archaeology Project (MAP), which made the find. The five-metre vessel – preserved by a lack of oxygen a mile down – has its mast, rudders and rowing benches in place. A two-hour film on the team’s discoveries is to due to be shown at the British Museum today.End austerity and boost economy – They seem an unlikely alliance but a collaboration between the leftwing Fabian Society and the chartered accountants of England and Wales has bolstered calls for Philip Hammond to ditch austerity and pencil in an extra £100bn of spending by the middle of the next decade. Adopting Labour’s tax and spending proposals would allow this, the Fabians say, arguing there is no clear case for the chancellor to stick to his plan of running a surplus and the emphasis should be on investment that will improve economic growth. To that end, Polly Toynbee argues Hammond could reap £155bn a year by attacking “the welfare state for the better-off and the very rich … If Hammond dare not, then lucky Labour will reap them instead. Austerity really could end if Hammond and May wanted it to. Their political lives will be short, so why not?”It’s the little things – Plastic stools are becoming more commonplace and this is not about informal seating trends. Nanoplastics are contaminating the human digestive tract, leading to fears the tiny particles may be widespread in the food chain, and strengthening the argument to stop the use of plastic wherever possible. Meanwhile bowel cancer is on the rise among the young in Europe – Professor Scott Montgomery of Örebro University hospital in Sweden and University College London, who was not involved in making the finding, said obesity was the most likely factor. And if you follow a meat-free diet, be aware this morning that some faux burger patties, fakin’ bacon and other simulacra contain more salt than seawater.Backstopped in her tracks – Lots of heat in the Commons yesterday about Brexit but in amongst it all were details of Theresa May’s goals to “to break the impasse” with Brussels over the Irish border and reach in-principle agreement by the end of November. There are four elements. The first is to make a UK-wide backstop legally binding so a Northern Ireland-only provision would no longer be needed. The second is to extend the transition period as an alternative to the backstop. Number three is a guarantee that neither a backstop nor the transition can be indefinite (to appease Brexiters). The fourth element is “full continued access for Northern Ireland’s businesses to the whole of the UK internal market”. The EU is dug in against any time limits for the backstop, and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to the UK, has said that since it was designed to operate in all circumstances, a time limit “would rather defeat the stated purpose”. Theresa May is to brief the cabinet on Brexit talks today.‘The Polish Macron’ – Poland’s first openly gay politician has said “progressives” can win in the country, after setbacks for the rightwing ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) in local elections. “If you give people a tempting, credible offer, people are willing to trust you,” said Robert Biedroń, who stood down as mayor of Słupsk to launch a pro-European, “pro-democratic” movement that aims to contest upcoming EU elections and Polish elections. Biedroń has been called “the Polish Macron” but his political manifesto is not yet complete. The left has no seats in the lower house and the governing PiS party is hostile to the EU. The European council president, Donald Tusk, is believed to be eyeing a return to Polish politics once he finishes up in Brussels.“Even hearing the word ‘gratitude’ makes my shoulders tense and my eyes narrow,” writes Moya Sarner. “I am too cynical to get on board this particular Oprah bandwagon – too British, too atheist, too sensitive to schmaltz.”“But gratitude’s currency continues to increase in value. Study after study has found a robust association between higher levels of gratitude and wellbeing, including protection from stress and depression, more fulfilling relationships, better sleep and greater resilience.” It can be as simple as spending part of every day for two weeks writing a list of three things for which you are grateful. “As the pages in my diary filled up with scribbled gratitude, I started to find the concept less vomitous,” Sarner writes. “After four weeks of counting my gratitude, I think I will keep doing it.”On the eve of his return to Old Trafford for Juventus tonight, Cristiano Ronaldo said he is a “happy man” and claimed “the truth comes first” as he answered questions in Manchester about the allegation of rape against him. Arsenal made it 10 victories on the spin in all competitions – seven of them in the Premier League – with a come-from-behind 3-1 win over Leicester, orchestrated by Mesut Özil.The most recent al-Jazeera documentary on spot-fixing in cricket is to be welcomed, writes Vic Marks, but it remains a source of frustration as well – every time it seems to be getting to the nitty-gritty, names are withheld. The much-debated changes to England’s traditional domestic rugby calendar will be announced today at Twickenham and, rather than lasting from early September to late May, the Premiership season will extend deep into June with all summer tours earmarked for July.

Photograph: CollinsSome schools were built too quickly during the Celtic Tiger years which is part of the reason for the urgent structural safety assessments being carried out in up to 30 schools, Minister for Education Joe McHugh has said.It emerged on Monday that 30 schools built by Western Building Systems (WBS) need to be structurally assessed after sections of a north Dublin school were closed this week due to safety concerns.Nearly 100 transition year students from Ardgillan Community College in Balbriggan were told to stay at home this week after structural problems were discovered in the school building.The section of the school built by WBS in 2009, which includes 18 classrooms, has been closed pending a full structural examination. Another section of the secondary school built by a different contractor in 2015, is not affected.Several of the 30 schools to be examined schools were delivered under a rapid-build government programme in 2008.This is the second review of schools built by WBS. In September last year the Department of Education announced plans to conduct fire safety reviews of 25 schools built by the Tyrone firm. This review followed audits that found fire safety defects in five schools the contractor built.Speaking on Tuesday, Mr McHugh said in 2007 and 2008 there was “a missive coming from the government at the time and the department to get 30 schools built within a 12 month period.“The context of over population, the context of increasing demand, and the context of trying to build schools too quickly was a major problem back then,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“Certainly the litigation processes going on at the moment will help inform us. I would also reach out to WBS today - if there are mitigation measures to be rectified, there has to be a responsibility there as well.“They’ve been asked, in the first place, to do that work. If that doesn’t happen we as a department have a responsibility to do that and we’ll follow up on who pays.”The problems came to light when extensive assessment of fire safety regulations was carried out in 55 schools, 30 of these built by Western Building Systems.“There has been varying degrees of deficiencies and shortcomings in relation to general fire safety. As a result of these assessments, it was decided it was necessary to look at invasive work within the walls, even though Ardgillan was outside the 55.”“My first concern is the pupils, the teachers, finding solutions if pupils have to be decanted from schools.”There is also an examination being carried out on the Tyrrelstown Educate Together in west Dublin.“We have to establish a trend and will have to see the outcome of the Tyrellstown investigation - if today shows up that there are issues in that school, certainly we are going to be anticipating that there will be more. That doesn’t mean there will be issues in all of them,” Mr McHugh said.The Minister added there were varying degrees of fire safety concerns in the schools being examined - from fire walls to doors not opening properly with. Up to eight of the WBS built schools had showed varying degrees of inefficiencies and deficiencies in fire safety regulations.He said the department will speak to each schools inidually to see what arrangements were required for this week and next week, in terms of more invasive work in the walls.The Minister said there was a possibility students at other schools will also be asked to stay home, “we will be informed now by engineering assessment of other schools.”Legal action from the department against WBS related to Gaelscoil Clocha Liatha, Greystones Mullingar Educate Together National School, Ardgillan Community College, and Tyrrelstown Educate Together, west Dublin.Fire safety issues with schools built by WBS were first flagged in October 2015 at Rush-Lusk Educate Together primary school.However, since 2015, the firm has been awarded contracts to build a Gaelscoil in Firhouse, and “rapid build modular homes” in the Dublin area.The company has previously defended its work on the school projects, and claimed it was not responsible for fire safety issues.It said work carried out by “other contractors subsequent to our handover” may have led to defects or breaches of regulation. A spokesman for the firm did not respond to requests for comment on the announcement of the structural safety review."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda and Customs operation also saw 90,000 units of illegal prescription medicines impoundedTaoiseach says President has right to use plane if it is available when he requests itCriminal Assets Bureau arrests man in his 30s in DundalkDelsie Gayle (77) has not received apology from airline, says daughter\u0026lsquoBritain is an important country, a serious country, a great country with great history\u0026rsquoSurvey finds almost half of girls in Transition Year have not yet chosen Leaving Cert subjectsThe 91-year-old crashed into a tree in a car park in Wexford on Monday afternoonWoman (33) was found strangled in her Dublin apartment on Sunday afternoonPosition had been vacant since last envoy stepped down following Trump inaugurationEoin Berkley had been detained under Mental Health Act prior to July 2017 assaultCare Alliance notes 6,000 now waiting for help at home as appeal of Fair Deal levels offRebecca Kelly, who received more than \u0026euro550,000 for injuries, conceded her own actions played a significant role in the incidentAcute flaccid paralysis marked by weakness and loss of muscle tone, but causes varyLaw Reform Commission report focuses on regulatory powers and corporate offencesCo Leitrim town fights the slump with positivity and shopfront paintingPresident \u0026lsquowelcomes\u0026rsquo PSNI statement seen as challenging his claim of \u0026lsquosecurity concerns\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3672165.1540276353!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins faces more turbulence over use of government jet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins launching his Shared Ireland, Shared Island initiative at Droichead Arts Centre in Drogheda, Co Louth, on Monday. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePresident Michael D Higgins has claimed he was following security advice from his own office when he used the Government jet to travel to Belfast for a function earlier this year.He has also said he welcomed a statement from the Police Service of Northern Ireland which has been seen as challenging his claim that security concerns meant he had to travel to Belfast by both plane and car. During a debate last week, Mr Higgins claimed he had to use both the Government jet and his State car because “security reasons” meant he “couldn’t be picked up at the Border”. He used the Government jet to travel to Belfast to deliver a speech last May, when his car also travelled to bring him from the airport to Queen’s University. A PSNI statement, which said it would “routinely work with visiting heads of state and other key figures visiting Northern Ireland and make full provisions for their safety in line with their requirements”, has been seen as a challenge to Mr Higgins’s initial account. The President said yesterday: “I am very happy with the official PSNI statement ... I agree with it and I am happy to reciprocate to it by again expressing my thanks for their co-operation and courtesy.”The Department of Defence regularly publishes a full itinerary of ministerial use of Air Corps aircraft, but use by the President is not disclosed. Mr Higgins’s rivals, who trail him by a huge distance according to opinion polls, have seized on his use of the facilities of the presidency.

Mr Higgins has come under criticism by his rivals, with Sinn Fein candidate Liadh Ni Riada calling on him to “come clean” about the matter. Mr Varadkar said the jet is usually used to save time to allow the President or Ministers attend additional functions or sometimes for security reasons. He said there is “understandable public concern” around the cost of using the Government jet, but stressed that pilots have to undertake a certain number of flying hours. “We had a very strange situation during the recession when it was actually being flown around empty because the pilots have to keep up a certain number of flying hours and the added cost is actually very small and there’s obviously security costs associated with going by land as well,” he added. Mr Varadkar and a number of Fine Gael ministers were canvassing in Dublin on Tuesday for President Higgins and a Yes vote in the upcoming blasphemy referendum. He said removing blasphemy as a criminal offence would “further modernise” the Constitution. “What we want to have in Ireland is a 21st century constitution for a 21st century republic. We’ve already reformed our Constitution to allow for things like marriage equality, women’s right to choose.“We believe that having a criminal offence for blasphemy in Ireland is a bit outdated so we’re asking people to change that. It’s very much part of a reform of our whole Constitution to make the country more modern.” Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3672168.1540282913!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defiant may sets out four backstop solutions with room to manoeuvre","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said that the UK might ask for a short extension of a planned transition period to ease its exit from the European Union.  Video: Parliamentlive.tv \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrime minister Theresa May  in the House of Commons, Monday. Photograph:  PA Theresa May sounded defiant in the House of Commons on Monday as she set out four demands for the resolution of the Northern Ireland backstop, the last major outstanding issue in the Brexit negotiations. But a careful reading of the prime minister’s statement suggests she has left herself more room for manoeuvre than may have been apparent to the MPs listening in the chamber.She described accurately the EU’s position that, while a UK-wide customs backstop is an option, it cannot be in the legally binding withdrawal agreement. So a Northern Ireland-specific backstop would be in the withdrawal agreement, which would include a reference to the UK-wide version written into the non-binding political declaration on the future relationship.“We must make the commitment to a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory legally binding, so the Northern Ireland-only proposal is no longer needed,” she said.Does this mean the Northern Ireland-only backstop is rendered redundant and would not be used? Or is May saying it must be removed from the withdrawal agreement and replaced by the UK-wide version?Downing Street said after May’s statement that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is “unacceptable” and there is no doubt that British negotiators would like to get rid of it altogether. But May’s formulation allows for the possibility that negotiators would find a way of making the UK-wide customs backstop legally binding but would leave the Northern Ireland-only version in the agreement as an ultimate insurance policy.May appeared to suggest that at the end of the post-Brexit transition period in December 2020, Britain could choose to extend the transition rather than trigger its UK-wide backstop. Perhaps the most intriguing of the prime minister’s points was her fourth – a promise to deliver on her commitment “to ensure full continued access for Northern Ireland’s businesses to the whole of the UK internal market”.This commitment does not rule out a backstop that would impose regulatory checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland, which the EU is proposing.By the end of Monday’s statement, the immediate threat to May’s leadership had receded, partly because of the lurid language used by some of her critics in off-the-record briefings that described her being knifed and said she should bring her own noose to a meeting with MPs. Her statement reassured her backbenchers that she will defend the union in the remaining weeks of the Brexit negotiations but it left the door open just wide enough for a creative solution to the backstop.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Parliamentlive.tv \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May said an option to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020 was one  alternative to the backstop.  Photograph:   PA WireTheresa May has called for a UK-wide customs backstop to be made legally binding in the Brexit withdrawal agreement so that it can replace the Northern Ireland-specific backstop proposed by the European Union. The prime minister told MPs on Monday that “in a\u0026nbspsubstantial shift in their position since Salzburg”, the EU was now actively working with Britain on its UK-wide backstop proposal.\u0026nbspEU negotiators say a UK-wide customs arrangement cannot be included in the legally binding withdrawal agreement, so a Northern Ireland-only backstop would still be required in that text.“We must make the commitment to a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory legally binding, so the Northern Ireland-only proposal is no longer needed. This would not only protect relations North-South, but also, vitally, east-west,” the British prime minister said.Ms May identified three other steps to resolve the issue, including an option to extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020 “as an alternative to the backstop”. She said there must be a mechanism to ensure that Britain could not be kept indefinitely within either arrangement against its will and that Northern Ireland’s businesses must continue to have access to the whole of the UK’s internal market.“Northern Ireland’s businesses rely heavily on trade with their largest market – Great Britain – and we must protect this in any scenario,” she said.\u0026nbspResponding to the prime minister’s remarks, the Irish Government reasserted its position that an extension of the 21-month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March could not be an alternative to the backstop.The Government said it would listen to any proposals from the UK but insisted that any proposal had to be “legally operative”, must protect the integrity of the EU single market and customs union, and “has to apply unless and until we have a new relationship that supersedes it”.Earlier, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain, Adrian O’Neill, told the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London that the backstop had become an issue of trust in the Brexit negotiations and he made clear that it would be necessary even if the transition period was extended.“Should this require the possibility of extending the 21-month transition period by a further brief time, Ireland would agree to such an extension. However, this would not obviate the need for a legally sound backstop arrangement to be included in the withdrawal agreement,” he said.Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley told the assembly that the British government would not allow a border to be put in place on the island of Ireland “in any situation” and that it stands by its commitment to a backstop.Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker on Monday withdrew amendments to a Northern Ireland Bill that would have required the approval of the Northern Ireland Assembly for any regulatory or customs arrangements that would distinguish Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The amendments, which had the support of the DUP as well as more than 40 Conservative backbenchers, would have effectively killed off the backstop.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The radio presenter was formerly a favourite to win the competition.Hope told Capital Radio Breakfast: “We had to have a dance-off as well.“It was very strange because after the dance-off, then the judges have to give their decisions but there was a bit of a conflab with some producers and then they gave their decisions.“It was just stunned silence in the studio, it was a really weird atmosphere.”All of the Strictly Come Dancing judges, except Craig Revel Horwood, backed Walsh and Jones to stay after the dance-off at the weekend.She also suggested Ballas dislikes her, after presenter Roman Kemp brought up the critical comments the judge made to her in week one of the competition.Hope responded: “I think I’ve got to be careful what I say here, because you never know what someone’s thinking. “And it was from week one that people were suggesting there was something there, I don’t know. It’s been consistent and Saturday night I really felt it was just weird, wasn’t it?”Fellow contestant Danny John-Jules appeared to sympathise with the presenter.The actor retweeted a tweet from a fan which read So torn between boycotting #Strictly the judges decision to save #SeannandKatya was the wrong 1 \u0026amp feels was done for publicity.Fans accused the show of putting viewing figures ahead of dance ability after the decision.Viewer Ann Brown tweeted: Strictly is all about viewing figures after tonight.. wrong couple voted off by the judges.Joanne Risdale agreed, adding: I think Strictly is fixed so to keep Sean and Katia in because they bring in the viewing figures.Rick Maskell said Vick Hope was robbed, tweeting: What a disgraceful verdict - only Craig told it like it was. The other judges MUST have been told to keep the CONTROVERSIAL dancer in because it ups the viewing figures. He couldn\u0027t dance in time. The better dancers were robbed.The show immediately after the kiss was exposed pulled in a large number of viewers, with figures hitting an average of 10.6 million tuned in to see the ‘Strictly’ contestants performing live, with a peak of 11.9 million.Those numbers were a leap up from the previous week, which had an average of 9.2 million watching live, and a peak figure of 10.4 million.A BBC spokesperson denied the claim, explaining: It is categorically untrue to imply that producers tell the judges how to score or who to save. Each judge votes on each dance independently, based on its merits and in their expert opinion alone.The judges use an electronic voting pad to transmit their score or choice of who to save to the production gallery which is then locked in and cannot be changed.Only after this does a producer speak to the judges, advising them on how long they have to speak and reminding them to give a reason for their decisions.

By 2010, the energy-producing kites were being built with rigid wings that could harness more power from a higher lift.The most recent version of the Makani kite was first flown in test flights in December 2016, performing loop-the-loops in a wide circle in the skies that produced up to 600 kW – enough electricity to power around 300 homes.It is estimated that wind power has the potential to meet the world\u0027s energy need 100-times over,\u0026nbspalthough only four\u0026nbspper cent of the world\u0027s electricity is currently generated from wind.Makani believes that it\u0027s possible to unlock additional wind resources that aren\u0027t accessible or cost effective today, the project\u0027s website states.\u0026nbspOur low mass opens up new possibilities for wind power in deepwater offshore sites. We continue to design, prototype and test energy kites so that more people around the world can have access to clean, affordable wind power.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For digital assets and decentralised apps to reach their potential, we believe mobile will need to be the main point of distribution. We look forward to partnering with developers in the blockchain community to usher in this vision.The smartphone will look and function much like any other high-end phone, with a 6-inch Quad HD display, a 16-megapixel rear camera and a powerful Snapdragon 845 processor.HTC Exodus is part of a new wave of smartphones incorporating blockchain technology into its device (HTC)However, it will also include a secure enclave that is separate from the Android operating system, where cryptocurrency can be securely stored.The Exodus 1 will also support decentralized, blockchain-supported apps that the firm hopes will help reshape the internet.HTC Exodus will be the first major smartphone to embrace blockchain technology, which the Taiwanese firm hopes will \u0027reshape the internet\u0027 (HTC)HTC\u0026nbspmay be the first of the major smartphone makers to integrate blockchain technology into its device, but it is not the only one.Earlier this year, Israeli startup Sirin Labs announced the Finney phone – a $1,000 smartphone that its creators hope will simultaneously revolutionise smartphones and deliver cryptocurrency to the masses.Dual-screen Finney phone is \u0027world\u0027s first blockchain smartphone\u0027We\u0027re blockchain enthusiasts, Nimrod May, Sirin Labs\u0027 chief marketing officer, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspin July. We want this phone to make all the benefits of blockchain technology available to as big an audience as possible, while making cryptocurrency accessible to the mainstream.Whether any of this new generation of phones catch on will depend on the success of the cryptocurrency space more broadly.Development for both phones would have begun when the market was experiencing a seemingly unending surge, however 2018 has seen a steady decline that has left bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies trading at around a third of their peak value.The future success of cryptocurrencies will equally depend on whether new technologies like the Finney phone and the Exodus 1 can establish a foothold in an already crowded smartphone market.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It also comes in a whole host of looks, with Apple re-introducing brighter colours to its range.Beyond the design, the features of the iPhone Xr are almost the same as its more expensive sibling. It still features the beefed up A12 bionic processor and the improved camera.But it also removes some of the more expensive features, too. The Xr has an LCD screen rather than the richer OLED found on the Xs, and features only one camera on the back instead of two.The Xr starts at $749 in the US, or roughly in the same in pounds and euros.

The next, we were posed with a difficult question: \u0027What do we do now?\u0027Mr Lau said the company had consulted with members of the media and tried to understand how to make sure that people watched it. But OnePlus eventually concluded that it would not be possible to ensure the new phone would get enough attention.We have to remain realistic, he wrote.\u0026nbspWe have only just begun our journey and cannot afford to let one of the most important products in our history be affected by another great product launch.OnePlus\u0026nbspinvites its customers to come along to its events, and\u0026nbspsaid that it would happily pay for changes that people were forced to make in order to attend, covering flights and hotels. Its team would be getting in touch with ticketholders, Mr Lau said.Other launch events that allow fans to watch livestreams together around the world – like the one held in London – will have their date adjusted a day forward accordingly.Apple\u0027s event on the 30th is unchanged. The company is expected to show off new iPads and Macs – and the event is notable for being one of the few Apple events that takes place outside of its home in California.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As they did, they pushed out oxygen, changing the atmosphere and filling it with the gas that allowed living things to survive.But that doesn\u0027t happen on the surface of Mars. There is only small bits of oxygen around, and so scientists feared that there might not be life on the surface.Bacteria found 600m underground \u0027hint at alien life on Mars\u0027But a new study, published in\u0026nbspNature Geoscience, used computer models to explore the briny lakes underneath the Mars surface. And it found there might be oxygen lurking in those pools.The new study found that the amount of oxygen in that briny surface could be enough to support aerobic life, according to the authors.That oxygen is especially concentrated at the poles of the planet, the authors write. And they could help explain how the mysterious oxidized rocks found on Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspsurface might have formed.The\u0026nbspstudy comes after\u0026nbspscientists announced this summer that they had found a vast lake underneath the Martian surface, in a major breakthrough for the search for alien life. That discovery helped settle the long debate about whether the planet had any water at all – and the new research will add to hopes that those pools could contain life.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

I think equally they both improved in the dance-off, which was great, but it’s down to personal taste, and I just preferred that one dance.”“I think technically they were both pretty abysmal, to be honest, it is true. I just went for the one that I liked the best on the night.”A spokesperson for the BBC has said: “It is categorically untrue to imply that producers tell the Judges how to score or who to save.

Campaigners argue that could force companies\u0026nbspto ban memes that use pictures or gifs from existing media, and that it could damage the way that social networks operate.EU parliament approves copyright rules that could be \u0027catastrophic\u0027Opposition to the rules has united copyright campaigners and the major internet platforms, which have argued that it could undermine the very way the internet\u0026nbspworks. Now YouTube has spoken out in perhaps the most passionate comments from the tech industry yet.The company said that YouTube could be forced to stop allowing normal users to upload videos, instead concentrating them in the hands of a small number of big companies. Viewers in the EU could be blocked from viewing some videos and small creators could be ruined, the company said.Ms\u0026nbspWojcicki\u0026nbspwrote that article 13 threatens to shut down the ability of millions of people –\u0026nbspfrom creators like you to everyday users –\u0026nbspto upload content to platforms like YouTube, in a letter written to the site\u0027s community of video creators. It threatens to block users in the EU from viewing content that is already live on the channels of creators everywhere, she wrote.The new rules also threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs, she said.The proposal could force platforms, like YouTube, to allow only content from a small number of large companies, she wrote.\u0026nbsp​It would be too risky for platforms to host content from smaller original content creators, because the platforms would now be directly liable for that content.Article 13 is just one part of a sweeping set of copyright rules that proponents claim will help fight against the theft and reuse of videos and music. Another controversial part of the rules is article 11, which will create a link tax and mean that sites like Google could have to pay to show a snippet of the websites they link out to.EU lawmakers have voted through the new rules and their wording could be finalised by the end of the year. The directive is expected to go into force soon after that.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was those paid-for photos that led to him having “health problems” and failing to walk his daughter down the aisle.After appearing on every TV and radio outlet that would pay for her bile-fuelled rants, Samantha recently tried to gain entrance to Buckingham Palace to meet Meghan.She was, quite rightly, told by grim-faced security staff to bog off.None of Samantha’s vitriol has stuck and most of the world has fallen almost as head-over-heels in love with Meghan as her besotted husband — especially since the news broke that they are expecting.Given that no one is interested in Samantha’s hysterical attacks on her sister, she wants to bury the hatchet.She has apologised for any past tensions and exclaimed that she’s jumping with joy at the baby news.It’s too little too late, and I’m sure Meghan would agree.Samantha has crossed the line too many times to be forgiven now.If she had shown any loyalty she might have been invited to the ­wedding and welcomed into the royal fold. But instead of acting as a peace-maker, Samantha stirred bad feeling between Meghan and her estranged father.A loving sister would have tried to build bridges, unite family ­factions and show solidarity with Meghan.I’m sure the new Duchess of Sussex would have ­welcomed having family members around her as she adjusted to le in the royal goldfish bowl.In the end, Meghan had only ONE close relative at her wedding, her mum Doria.Along with the absence of the late Princess Diana, it was the day’s only sad note.Samantha could have had a starring role as a loyal sister helping Meghan adjust from successful actress to worldwide megastar.The media would have fallen over themselves to talk to her for insights into her famous sister, but not any more. We are all very tired of Samantha’s negativity and venom.No one has any time for her any more, and for such an attention-seeker that has got to hurt.If she had been kind to Meghan, Samantha would still be relevant. TV stations, magazines and newspapers would be asking her about the mum-to-be and she would be at the heart of all the pregnancy coverage.Instead of being a loyal, loving and supportive source of information about Meghan, Samantha is now ­dismissed as jealous, irrelevant and malicious. No one cares about her opinion any more.Meanwhile, Meghan has won over Australia with a charm offensive that shows no sign of flagging. She and Harry are a true partnership.Unlike the tension between his parents Princess Diana and Prince Charles, Harry is genuinely delighted to see the enthusiasm and love for his we during this tour.Charles would famously get the hump because everyone wanted to meet Diana on royal walkabouts.In contrast, Harry and Meghan are relaxed, spontaneous and genuinely adore each other. It has been good to see them having fun and giving hugs and smiles to the crowds.While Meghan grows in confidence and the public’s affection, Samantha is now an irrelevance.It’s her own fault and she has to live with it. She will always have her nose pressed against the window pane of whatever palace her little sister is in at the time.Still, Sam, there’s always panto, eh ONE of the great joys of my le was watching Disney movies with my daughter when she was growing up.We watched my childhood favourites Dumbo, Bambi and Snow White, then I sat through Beauty And The Beast and The Little Mermaid about two thousand and ten times.So I was bemused to hear that Keira Knightley has banned her three-year-old daughter from ­watching some Disney movies such as Cinderella because the characters are “rescued” by men.This is rather joyless.Cinders might have been wooed by a man dumb enough not to recognise the love of his le until her foot fitted inside a glass slipper, but Belle from Beauty And The Beast is a book-loving, independent girl who tells the handsome but horrible Gaston to sling his hook and falls for the Beast because of the man he is inside. Pocahontas, Tiana, Merida, Rapunzel and especially Mulan are all kick-ass, feisty females.Disney remade Cinderella in  and she was a very dferent character.Keira doesn’t have to let her daughter watch Cinderella when there are so many alternatives available, but she also doesn’t need to be so blinking sanctimonious about it.So Joanna in The Cry is actually in court accused of murdering her sleazebag of a husband after they faked the kidnapping of their dead baby.It’s the last episode tomorrow, when we will find out what the heck has been going on.ButJoanna, played by Jenna Coleman, left, really did kill husband Alistair, I reckon it’s justiable homicide.The ghastly toad sat with his eyemask on and earplugs in, leaving her to deal with a screeching baby all through that epic flight to Australia.Surely on those grounds alone no court would convict her.I ADORED Freddie Mercury and would have gladly given a year of my le to be a fly on the wall at one of his notoriously extravagant and outrageous parties.He was a complete one-off, so I was always rather sceptical and a bit concerned about any film that would try to depict his extraordinary le and capture his sheer showmanship.Thankfully, the makers of new film Bohemian Rhapsody found the ridiculously talented American actor Rami Malek.He doesn’t so much play the part of Freddie but rather inhabits his body and brings him back to le.It’s an Oscar-worthy performance that is both funny and deeply moving and Rami is backed up by the perfectly cast three other members of Queen.Gwilym Lee as Brian May is so uncannily like the ace guitarist that his we Anita Dobson thought she had actually gone back in time, as he’s the spitting image of Brian when the two of them met.The Live Aid sequence, recreating the moment when Freddie and the band blew everyone away with their barnstorming performance, gave me goosebumps.I blubbed a lot during this movie, as well as laughing out loud.It also had me rushing to download all the original Queen albums and rediscovering tracks like Keep Yourself Alive and Doing All Right, as well as the classics such as Killer Queen and We Are The Champions.It’s a cracking film and a love letter to one of the greatest entertainers and most charismatic rock stars of all time. WELL, what a shock and surprise that Girls Aloud’s Nadine Coyle and Cheryl were never best pals. . . said no one ever.It was clear that these two, below in , never really hit it off right from the start when the girls won TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in  against boyband One True Voice.Back then Nadine was very much the star and lead vocalist, which led to tensions in the group.The girls split into two factions – Nadine and Sarah Harding on one side and Cheryl, Nicola Roberts and ­Kimberley Walsh on the other.Tellingly, Nadine said the girls have never had a big fall-out because they were never really friends in the first place.This is what tends to happen when boy and girl bands are thrown together in a reality show and don’t have a shared history. Cracks appear and there are resentments over who is ­perceived as being ­centre stage.A notable exception are the hugely ­likeable Little Mix, who put all their energies into their music and also to ensuring they give out positive messages about self-esteem and body confidence to their legions of fans.These girls have become genuinely good friends who have each other’s backs and who know that they are stronger together than they would bethey had to stand alone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because that would be a stupid thing to do.I don’t much hold with how the Vatican dealt with the industrial-strength paedophilia, but that doesn’t mean I should cut up my Catholic girlfriend’s clothes.Putin is mad but I have Russian friends. Trump is an a**e but I still fancy Taylor Swt. Assad is evil but one of the most enjoyable evenings I’ve ever spent was with Syrian people in Damascus.This is what the Labour Party seems to be incapable of grasping. That you can have issues with Israel’s behaviour over the past  years and its intransigence now.But that there’s a world of dference between a state in the Middle East that must fight for its survival, and Mr Gruber, the Jewish antique dealer in the Paddington stories.You can’t hurt him because of all the rocket attacks on the Gaza strip any more than you can hurt me because of what an Englishman did on his plantation in Jamaica back in .People are people. Some are very nice and some are very terrible and being Jewish or Catholic or English has nothing to do with it. I could convert to Judaism.It would mean having my foreskin cut off and promising not to eat another bacon sandwich, so it’s not going to happen. Butit did, would that make me fair game for Corbyn’s SS It probably would. Because I’d taken up salt beef sandwiches, they’d get it into their heads that I was obviously an Israeli army general. It’s daft. I mean, Cat Stevens is a Muslim. But that doesn’t mean, every time he warbles his way through Matthew And Son, that he’s about to explode.You don’t meet a Cambodian waiter and think: “Aha. You’re in the Khmer Rouge”, any more than you think when you meet an Argentinian that he must be a stone-throwing moron — actually, come to think of it, I do think that. But I know I’m in the wrong.Some Argies are great. They must be. It’s just that I haven’t met one yet.But whatever, somebody said to me last week that the Labour Party will win the next general election, and I’m genuinely appalled by that because evenCorbyn isn’t a truly horrible piece of work — and he is — his henchmen are not just amusing Trots and commies. They’re downright bloody dangerous.Every day, I open the newspaper and there’s nothing.I do hope they’re all right.FOLLOWING three separate and serious accidents on the M this week, we all know what’s coming next.A lot of high-pitched nasal whining from the nation’s speed camera enthusiasts, who’ll jump up and down and weep into their beakers of organic soil juice.And no one will have the gumption to explain that the most serious of the crashes was caused because a dithery octogenarian chose to drive his car and caravan the wrong way up the carriageway.And the only way you can prevent accidents like this from happening is to say to the nation’s elderly: “We don’t care how competent and fit you feel and we don’t care how much you need a car to get about. You can’t have a licence once you’re past . The end.”DRIVERS are being urged to open their car door with their left hand, which causes the body to twist and therefore makes it easier to check no bicycles are coming.Safety and health people say the cyclists slamming into just- opened car doors is becoming a serious problem. Many, apparently, have sustained bruising and grazes and hurty knees.Of course, there is another idea. Cyclists should slow down when passing a car and give it a wide berth.Or better still, accept that roads are for cars and leave the children’s toy at home.IT’S now pretty much certain that there’s enough gas trapped in the rocks under northern England to keep Britain warm for  years.THE men who appeared this week in a video, shooting a bull elephant in Namibia, have defended themselves.They say hunting like this brings much-needed revenue to what’s a poor area, that only two hunting licences are issued a year and that it is necessary once in a while to have a small cull of the bulls. It all sounds very reasonable.But the fact is that they had the shooting skills of Stevie Wonder. They were pumping bullets into the poor animal and it didn’t go down for an age. You see more clean kills than that in a Mexican drug lord’s cellar.And why not take the shot when the animal is on its own  Why take it when the animal is with its mates, all of whom were plainly upset by the hideous spectacle So, I’m sorry. While it may be necessary to kill the odd elephant – though I can’t for the le of me work out why – can the job be given to someone who knows what he’s doing.RUSSIA has tried on a couple of occasions to build a big mirror in space that would reflect some of the sun’s light on to a town during the night. That would mean street lights are no longer needed.They’ve never made it work but as it sounds like a good idea, the Chinese have decided to give it a go.The mirror they’re creating will appear in the night sky like a bright star but, they say, it will give off just enough light for people to see where they’re going. Brilliant. Except for one small problem.The town on to which this heavenly torch will shine its light is Chengdu.And a small bit of research reveals that Chengdu is China’s Manchester. It’s foggy, cloudy or raining for  days of the year.I DID wonder why Bruce Springsteen decided to extend his Broadway show.I mean, he’s nearly , so why climb on stage every single night to tell the same old stories and sing the same old songs Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That puts the few hundred thousand on yesterday’s march in perspective, doesn’t it Just because those voters didn’t get dressed up for an afternoon stroll doesn’t make their democratic input any less signicant. The Remain propaganda leaflet sent to every household before the Referendum — at the cost of millions of pounds to the taxpayer — laid out what that vote meant: “The Government will implement what you decide.”It’s beyond us why anybody would want to jump back into bed with the EU.

The pint-sized Speaker appears to be the worst of the lot.We’re used to his attention-grabbing stunts in the Chamber.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Slavery comes in many forms, including forced labour, sex trafficking, child marriage and being born into slavery that is passed down through generations.Domestic slavery, which Marish experiences, takes place in private homes where people are forced to work for little or no pay, doing domestic chores like cooking, cleaning, laundry and childcare.It happens all over the world, and in Hungary, where Marish lives, there is no effective law to prevent domestic slavery.Marish sleeps on a worn sofa, barely managing to get a couple of hours rest between the relentless chores and -hour shts at a factory. All her factory earnings are taken away by the family who have enslaved her.“I don’t get any money,” she says. “Ever.”The documentary was originally meant to be a five minute film, shot over a few days, but those days quickly turned into months after Bernadett Tuza-Ritter uncovered a horrying reality.Domestic slaves are often stopped from leaving the house, contact with their families is limited by their employer and their documents are confiscated. They live in fear, due to threats or physical violence.Viewers learn that all of these abuses are suffered by Marish over the course of the documentary.Marish tells director Bernadett Tuzza-Ritter, “If Eta asks, tell her I never spoke to you. I just answered your questions. You’re not supposed to know anything”.Eta is the family matriarch and she is keeping Marish in slavery.She beats and verbally abuses her, calling her an old hag, starves her and has taken away her identying documents.Eta can be heard shouting, “I’ll break your skull, bitch” and telling Marish, ‘‘What a miserable woman you are. You’re not worth anything.”Eta keeps three servants so she doesn’t have to work herself and they are kept in similar conditions to Marish.She is so proud to have servants that she allows Tuzza Ritter to film in her home, for a fee.She is filmed lounging, flicking cigarette ash with her feet up, while her slaves do everything from feeding her children to making her bed every morning.She says, “I give them cigarettes” as though this makes up for the beatings and domestic drudgery. Cigarettes are Marish’s only payment.Eta is the only member of the family interviewed, but her children can be heard in the background of shots, laughing about how they will blame Marish for breaking crockery.Eta and her familys faces are never shown.Marishs daughter Vivi ran away at  due to Eta’s cruelty. She was forced to provide childcare and stopped from leaving the house, going to school or having any friends.Marish is so terried for the safety of her family that she says her older children don’t know where she is because she doesn’t want to put them in ‘jeopardy’.The reason for how Marish ended up working for Eta isnt clear but she says that its impossible to escape.“There’s no place to go and nobody to help me,” she tells Tuzza-Ritter.When asked whether she has eaten that day, Marish says, “No and I won’t.”She isn’t allowed to leave the house without permission and the last time she dared go to the grocery store to buy food without asking, she was beaten as soon as she got back.All Marish wants is an apartment for herself and her daughter, but Eta has forced her to sign for Hungarian loans on behalf of the family, trapping her in debt to them.The documentary highlights in painful detail how Marish is financially, physically and psychologically controlled by her captors.She says that the Hungarian police won’t help her and don’t offer protection to victims of slavery.When Tuzza-Ritter called the police about Marish’s situation anonymously, they told her “they were aware of the phenomenon, but there was nothing they could do about it.Marish tries to turn to the National Crisis Telephone Service for help, but they frustratingly tell her they “only support victims of domestic violence” and say they could only help hershe’d been abused by her own family.Storyville: A Woman Captured is on BBC tonight at pm. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

The landlord and tenants had been told last week that the flat should have a maximum occupancy of two people andthat was not complied with further action would follow.Landlord Dr Mehat, said in a statement: This particular flat was and is rented to a couple with two small children.Following complaints about rubbish disposal from neighbours of the property I visited the tenants.I was suspicious that there were more people in the flat than I expected and when I challenged the tenants they told me that was just temporary as they had visitors. He added: We were not complicit in this overcrowding or profiteering in any way from this.Dr Mehat was arrested last year on suspicion of causing GBH with intent after a three-month-old baby was allegedly circumcised without his mothers consent.The GP was held by police investigating the procedure, in which the tot was said to have been operated on while on a visit to his paternal grandparents, who are Muslim.But the case was eventually dropped and no charges were brought after Dr Mehat told police he believed the boys mother had given her permission for the  circumcision.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I may never be as healthy or strong as I was but I’m still here with my family and that is very precious to me.”The grandad, who also suffers from type  diabetes, fell ill in January , with the blood poisoning taking hold of his body within hours.Ricky claims that he had bitten his thumbnail down too far, and noticed a tiny blister forming on his thumb.Thinking nothing of it, he initially ignored it but a few hours later, the infection has spread through his blood stream.He added: “All I can remember is asking a nurseI was going to die. It was a terrible time.”Sepsis is the primary cause of death from infection around the world, claiming around , lives in the UK each year – that’s more than more deaths than bowel, breast and prostate cancer combined.The condition is always triggered by an infection.Most often the culprit is an infection we all recognise - pneumonia, urinary infections , skin infections, including cellulitis, and infections in the stomach, for example appendicitis.Typically, when a person suffers a minor cut, the area surrounding the wound will become red, swollen and warm to touch.This is evidence the bodys immune system has kicked into action, releasing white blood cells to the site of the injury to kill off the bacteria causing the infection.The white blood cells and platelets form blood clots in the tissues around the cut.Blood vessels swell to allow more blood to flow, and they become leaky, allowing infection-fighting cells to get out of the blood and into the tissues where they are needed.This causes inflammation, which appears to us as the red, warm swelling.When sepsis happens, this system goes into overdrive.The inflammation that is typically seen just around the minor cut, spreads through the body, affecting healthy tissue and organs.The immune system - the bodys defence mechanism - overreacts and the result is it attacks the body.It can lead to organ failure and septic shock, which can prove fatal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443709764.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle holds baby bump prince harry fiji banquet","story":"The royal couple dressed up to the nines for the black tie dinner hosted by the country’s president at the Grand Pacic Hotel.The Duke of Sussex wore a tuxedo while the Duchess came decked out in a light blue dress by designer SAFiYAA.The gorgeous gown features a cape silhouette and the colour is thought to be a nod to the host country, whose flag is the same shade.The outfit, worn with diamond drop-earrings and her hair down, was by German-born London-based designer Daniela Karmuts.The pair smiled as they chatted with other guests at the champagne reception ahead of the banquet.Meghan earlier arrived in Fiji wearing a dress by Australian designer Zimmerman, a hat by Stephen Jones, earrings given to her by the Queen and a bracelet which was a gt from the Prince of Wales.The pair were met at Suvas Nausori Airport by Melanie Hopkins, the High Commissioner and chief of protocol, Jonetani Tagivetaua.They disembarked their Qantas charter flight to light rain and were introduced to the Hon Frank Bainamara, Fijis PM and his we, Maria, Ro Teimumu Kepa.But everything didnt go quite as smoothly as they might have liked, with winds blowing the Duchesss hair across her face.The red carpet even came close to taking off amid the strong gusts -

The Prime Minister briefed ministers after days of Tory infighting and no sign of movement on the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland border. Despite an EU summit falling through with no deal last week, she told MPs the terms of Britains orce were % agreed. To break the deadlock, she offered to either extend Britains transition period beyond December  - or accept a backstop plan with no end date that would keep EU customs rules across the UK. Both plans enrage Brexiteers. But last night she threw them a bone by digging in her heels - against the EU. She again rejected any backstop that would set up dferent rules for Britain compared to Northern Ireland. And she insisted a transition period must end well before May .  Todays Cabinet meeting came on another busy day as time ticks down to Brexit Day on  March .One of Britains top scientists tore into Tory Brexit chaos  Nobel Prize winners raised the alarm over leaving the EU Suppliers of NHS medicine warned No Deal Brexit could need emergency powers to stop drugs running out The head of the National Crime Agency warned crime-fighting will be signicantly impacted by No Deal The latest display of unrest came amid reports almost  - the number needed - Tory MPs have submitted letters to trigger a leadership contest. Some  Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson, have put their names to a public campaign to kill off Theresa Mays plan for Brexit. But there were signs that a series of lurid briefings over the weekend by unnamed backbenchers calling for her to be kned and advising her to bring her own noose had backfired, causing MPs to rally behind her.  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - a prominent Leave campaigner in the referendum - warned it would be a mistake for MPs to move against the Prime Minister at a crucial moment in the Brexit talks. We are in a process of negotiation. It would seem to be an act of utter folly to change the Prime Minister at this point, he told Sky News during a visit to New York. Andrew Mitchell - an ally of former Brexit secretary David Davis who is seen as a possible leadership contender - also said a leadership challenge would be a mistake. End of October : No Deal preparations have to begin in the UK government no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time.  October : The Budget. It will spell out no deal preparations and be a test of loyalty for the DUP, who are supposed to vote with the government but could rebel. Mid-November : The UK was hoping for a final Brexit summit to seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. However, this summit still hasnt been approved and may not happen because of splits over how to solve Northern Ireland border. - December : The next scheduled European Council summit. This is the last chance saloon to get a deal. Already its much later than was ideal. Otherwise there wont be time to sign it off before Brexit Day. After a deal is reached: MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will be in deep, deep troubleshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But talk has been floated of extending this by a few months. After December : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. I think it is right to give the Prime Minister every support to conclude a deal, he told BBCs Newsnight. However, he warned Mrs May could struggle to get the support of the House of Commons for any agreement she brings back from Brussels. There is a danger tonight it seems to me that Parliament wont accept that deal or any other deal. That will be a serious problem, he said.  There was further respite for Theresa May when the leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker announced he was withdrawing amendments to the Northern Ireland Bill designed to prevent the activation of the so-called Northern Ireland backstop - intended to ensure the border remains open after Brexit. The former Brexit minister - who quit over Mrs Mays Chequers plan for leaving the EU - later welcomed her strong assurance in the House on maintaining the integrity of the UK. The Prime Minister told MPs she could not accept the EUs original backstop plan as it would mean imposing controls on goods traded between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, creating a customs border down the Irish Sea.  While she was ready to explore every possible option to break the impasse, she said a critical first step should be a legally-binding agreement on a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory to avoid the need for a Northern Ireland-only backstop. As an alternative,at the end of the transition at the end of  a deal on the UKs future relationship with the EU was not quite ready, she said it might by preferable to prolong the transition. However, she stressed any such extension would have to be for a short time only and would have to be over well before the scheduled end of the current parliament in May .

Sir Paul Nurse tore into universities minister Sam Gyimah for letting extremists dominate and demanded he get a grip in a withering attack. It came after Francis Crick Institute director Sir Paul, who won the Nobel Prize in , united with  fellow laureates to sound a warning about the impact of leaving the EU. In a letter to the Prime Minister they warned creating new barriers through Brexit will inhibit progress to the detriment of us all. This morning Sir Paul blasted Brexit chaos as he clashed personally with the Tory universities minister in a rare prime-time debate.  He told Sam Gyimah on BBC Radio s Today programme: We havent seen anything out there that gives us confidence this thing is going to be delivered. I can’t tell you how depressed our young scientists are about all the messages that are coming out of government. This is just awful. I talk to them all the time. You need to get the messaging much better. You need to be much more positive not just about science but what young people can contribute - and the rest of the world. You’re letting your extremists dominate the debate. You’ve got to get a grip of them and stop them sending all these bad messages.  Mr Gyimah insisted he agreed scientists need to be able to come and go under immigration rules and he was prioritising science in Brexit talks. The minister also said unprecedented levels of funding were going into scientic research - an extra poundbillion. But he dodged Sir Pauls question about where poundbillion of lost funding would come from after Brexit. The minister replied: Well... Paul... its... I cant discuss now the shape of the deal we’re going to have.  Today it emerged dozens of winners of the Nobel Prize have written to the Prime Minister and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker setting out their concerns. Their message was joined by the London-based Francis Crick Institute. Many of us in the science community therefore regret the UKs decision to leave the European Union because it risks such barriers, the group said.  They urged both sides in the Brexit negotiations to ensure as little harm as possible is done to research. The letters signatories include biologist Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society. Meanwhile, a survey of more than , staff at the Crick found % of them believed a hard Brexit would be bad for UK science. And % thought it would have a detrimental effect on European science. The Crick is the biggest biomedical research lab under one roof in Europe and has been publicly praised by the Prime Minister, who toured the facility with Indian counterpart Narendra Modi in April.  Sir Paul said: This survey reveals the depth of feeling amongst scientists that a hard Brexit will seriously damage research, and that the UK Government is not paying enough attention to science in the Brexit negotiations. Science and research matter for economic growth, health and quality of le, and the environment. The overwhelming negativity of scientists towards a hard Brexit should be a wake-up call. A hard Brexit could cripple science and the UK Government needs to sit up and listen. We need a deal that replaces the science funding lost because of Brexit, that preserves freedom of movement for talented scientists, and that makes them feel welcome in this country.

Ken then asked to speak to a manager but they agreed with the cashier and refused to sell him the alcohol. He eventually went back to the store alone several hours later and was allowed to buy the alcohol, but says the policy is ridiculous because he was the one buying the shopping, not his daughter. Aldi meanwhile, says it has apologised to Ken for the inconvenience, but stands by its Challenge  policy.  Ken said: Ive been there with my daughter many times and this is the first time it has happened. Ive been going there since it opened. I told them she wasnt the one who was buying it.

He says that a member of staff announced to a manager that his daughter - who does not wish to be named - had anxiety loud enough for everyone in the shop to hear which left her in tears. Ken added: I wanted to take this up because of the offence caused to my daughter. Im not bothered about me, but Im fuming about what they did to her.

Victoria Bagnall has been living off benefits and supporting her family after giving up work to care for her ailing husband and their two-year-old son. She claims she begged DWP bosses not to halt her Jobseekeers Allowance payments pound every two weeks - but her pleas were ignored. Within hours, Victoria says, she lost her baby as she had a shower at home, the Daily Record reports. The -year-old, from Glasgow, said: “My doctor told me that my miscarriage could have been brought on by stress.  “I was sick with worry. I have worked all my days and had no idea how we were going to be able to survive with no money. “I was having a shower and suddenly I started bleeding heavily. “The next thing I knew, the foetus came out and I grabbed it. It was tiny and just starting to form. “I could see my baby’s eyes, limbs and even its tiny heart. “I didn’t know what to do. I just cried and held our child in my hands until the paramedics arrived.” Victoria was  weeks pregnant when she was sent a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions on October  telling her they were stopping her Jobseekeers Allowance with immediate effect. She was forced to give up her job as a supervisor at soft play centre Whale of a Time after her partner Gerald Loftus, , tore the cruciate ligament in his knee, leaving him unable to look after their toddler Patrick.  Victoria said: “I’ve worked since the day I left school and I had to give up my job to help care for my partner and son. “This is the first time I’ve claimed benefits in my le and it’s not a position I ever thought I’d be in. “Gerald suffered a stroke  years ago and he also struggles with depression. “We always managed to cope until last month when he injured his knee, leaving him in agony and unable to run around after our son. “Patrick was suffering and Gerald was getting down because he couldn’t look after him properly. “He found it dficult to get about and we don’t have anyone  who can help, so the only option left was for me to give up work. “It wasn’t an easy decision to make and we went from having a regular income to relying on Jobseekers Allowance of pound every two weeks.  “It was a struggle to pay bills, buy food and heat our home, but at least we had some money coming in. I received three payments until I was sent a letter from the DWP saying my benefits were being stopped because I had voluntarily made myself redundant. “I’d already explained the circumstances surrounding my decision to stop working and was told that I could claim benefits – but in a matter of weeks they changed their minds.” The couple were advised to go to their local Jobcentre and apply for Universal Credit but were then told they did not qualy for support. Victoria claims she was also told she wouldn’t be able to receive any JSA payment until February , . Gerald, who worked with Glasgow City Council before his stroke, said: “We begged but the staff showed no interest and basically left us penniless. “They knew Victoria was pregnant and we had a little boy to feed. “I showed them my medical reports but nothing mattered and they refused to help. “We don’t qualy for Universal Credit and I lost my own claim when Victoria moved in with me. We were devastated and very stressed by what we’d been put through.” After suffering the miscarriage, Victoria was rushed by ambulance to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow. Related video: A single mum on Universal Credit can’t afford school unorms for kids  Fighting back tears, she said: “I was very stressed and angry at what we’d been put through at the job centre. “The only ray of light was the fact that we were having a little baby and it was something we were all looking forward to. “We always wanted Patrick to have a brother or a sister and it just felt like a blessing. “The pregnancy was going really well and I was due to have our first scan the following week. “When I went into the shower, I felt that something was wrong. “My waters broke and I could feel I was losing the baby. It broke my heart and I just couldn’t believe what was happening. “It was too early to knowour baby was a boy or a girl and I stood with this tiny body in my hands.

Ysgol Cwm Brombil, which opens next month in Port Talbot, south Wales, will have mixed toilets in its primary school. Children aged five to  will use the facilities and share a wash area, Wales Online reports. But it has ided the opinion of parents, some of whom have slammed the idea. Daniel Treagus wrote on Facebook: So the new Ysgol Cwm Brombil school apparently have toilets that girls [use] one side and boys the other. However, all in one room.  I certainly think this is well out of order. My kids will be getting front door keys cut so they can use the house for toilet breaks, he added. There are many problems with them. There are possible benefits but the problems outweigh them. Schools should be in the real world. Carol Beckett Jenkins said she thought it was terrible, adding that her granddaughter went to a school that had them and waited to come home to use the toilet. Boys can be cruel at times and dont understand a lot about periods, another mum wrote.  But the local authority says the move will reduce bullying at the poundmillion co-educational which will comprise primary and secondary phases. And other parents have supported the move. Deborah Tucker said: I cant see the problem - it is a great idea and it is working well in the other schools. Embrace it. Its happening, is accepted and working. Councillor Peter Rees, Neath Port Talbot Council’s cabinet member for education, leisure and culture, said the toilets were located just off the main corridors and featured floor to ceiling cubicles with open hand-washing areas.  He said: Whilst this is also the layout at Ysgol Cwm Brombil, the school has chosen to designate facilities on one side of the building as all female and the other as all male, a more traditional set up and one which the flexibility of the design easily allows for. All secondary phase parents have visited the new build over the last two weeks as part of the transition process for when the pupils move in after half term and no concerns were raised at that point regarding the toilet facilities that the school were aware of. Within the primary phase the toilets are mixed, as was the case in the former Groes Primary which Ysgol Cwm Brombil is replacing. Groes was one of the first primary schools to introduce these some years ago and parents have been happy with arrangements.

He shared pictures of the stunning flower arrangements, including the displays on tables in a beautully decorated room.

Eugenie and Jack tied the knot in front of about  people at St Georges Chapel in Windsor earlier this month.

Prince George and Princess Charlotte were adorable little bridesmaids, and Robbie Williams daughter was also in the bridal party. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they were expecting their first child just days after the wedding, and many claimed this had caused tension in the Royal Family.  However Eugenie shut the rumours down by liking photos of Meghan on Instagram earlier this week. The royal family paid for the three parties out of their personal funds, however taxpayers were hit with the bill for security, which is expected to exceed poundmillion.This has been criticised by many who believe Eugenie, who is ninth in line to the throne and doesnt carry out any official duties, should have had a lower-key - and cheaper - wedding."},{"url":null,"title":"royal tour incredible story behind","story":"NewsRoyal Tour: Incredible story behind this photo of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry with two paramedicsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry were introduced to paramedics Graeme Cooper and Danielle Kellam during their Royal Tour - but they already knew all about themShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  OCT NewsIts a really lovely photo \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have been given a huge selection of gts on their Royal Tour, with well-wishers presenting them with everything from shoes to carrots.

An inquest heard that Heather Donlin had a long history of mental health problems , including suicide attempts, self-harm, panic and anxiety. But Heather was discharged as a patient by the Avon and Wiltshire mental health partnershiptwo months before she took her own le in February, reports Bristol Live .Avon Coroners Court heard that the teenager had struggled to attend appointments due to anxiety and at times as unable to leave her home at all. She was told by AWP that she should go to her doctors instead.  During those two months after she was discharged and before her death in February this year, the -year-old attended AE a number of times having taken overdoses or threatened to take her own le. She was admitted to AE four times in total in the  months leading up to her death, and on a number of occasions, Heather’s mum Tara asked doctors at hospital to detain her daughter under the Mental Health Act, but she never was ‘sectioned’. Coroner Peter Harrowing heard that in late January and early February, her mental health deteriorated. In late January this year, she called the mental health Crisis team to tell them she wanted to take her own le, and was told to call her social worker. On the last day of January, she smashed up her bedroom at the family home in Fishponds, and police were called. On February  went to her local GP, Katrina Whalley, who described her as being ‘distraught’ and said that she was going to take her own le. So she sent a request that Heather was contacted by mental health professionals within  hours. The inquest heard she was called the same day, and an appointment arranged for February , but at am that morning, she called AWP’s Crisis Team to say she wouldn’t be able to come as she was having trouble sleeping. An appointment was rearranged for February , and she attended the mental health centre in Speedwell, where she saw mental health nurse Ashley Russell. Mr Russell told the coroner that he had read up on Heather’s history, and knew she had previously indicated ‘suicidal ideations’. But that morning she didn’t, and reassured Mr Russell she would be able to keep herself safe. “She engaged well. I felt we established a rapport,” he said. “She was distressed and tearful at times. She was dressed appropriately for the time of year,” he added. Mr Russell said Heather told him about the instability of her living arrangements - she split her time between her girlfriend’s and her family home - and about how she previously attempted to take her own le in the weeks previously. “I asked her specicallyshe had a plan to harm herself, she said ‘no’. “I did not consider she was an immediate risk to herself, and she was actively seeking our help. She said she would like to find stable accommodation and more stable relationships, and that we would work to help with her anxiety and panic. “There was medication that was needed immediately,” he added. There was no evidence there was an immediate risk, but there was a concern about the ongoing suicidal thoughts. Mr Russell left Heather with his number, and the number of the Crisis Team, and a plan to get back in touch in the coming days, after he had spoken to the person who dealt with her care the previous year, and her social worker. But tragically, the following morning, February , Heather was due to meet her mum in the city centre but said she wasn’t able to get a lt into town. Heather’s mum Tara ed to find she had taken her own le that morning.  Coroner Peter Harrowing recorded a conclusion that Heather took her own le. A spokesperson for Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership said: “We’d like to offer the family of Heather Donlin our sincere condolences.” Heather’s mum Tara was too upset to talk following the inquest. After her death earlier this year, she raised questions about her care, being discharged from AWP care because she was too ill to get to appointments, and why she was not sectioned despite repeatedly being admitted to AE following overdoses or other attempts to take her own le. In the midst of Tara’s grief, just four days later, she let off a smoke grenade in the middle of council chamber’s public gallery during Bristol City Council’s annual budget meeting, in protest at cuts to social services, mental health services and young people’s services. In the middle of her protest, she said: “Shewasn’t just failed by myself, she was failed by social services, mental health services. Andyou make any cuts to those services you are going to have a hell of a lot of blood in this council chamber. “My daughter has been killed by the system, and I am angry,” she added. After her death, tributes poured in for Heather, who went to Bristol Brunel Academy and her funeral was well attended. “She was one of the sweetest, craziest, funniest, grumpiest people you could ever meet, all rolled into one gorgeous person,” said her mum Tara. “There are no words I can use to express what an amazing person she is and the way I feel about her,” she added.If you are affected by any issues raised in this story, contact The Samaritans for confidential support on  .

The resulting odour was so powerful she says she began to retch uncontrollably. Emma explained: My partner, who cant smell a lot thanks to his days playing rugby, said have a smell of this, and as I went over to it I thought oh my god. Seconds later I was throwing up. It was disgusting. The -year-old from Treherbert, who has endometriosis and has just had her eighth op to treat the condition, ed home from hospital last Wednesdayand has been recovering since. The keyhole surgery left her with stitches in her stomach and unable to walk much further than the bathroom.  Emma added: I was retching, I could feel there was something wrong and I took the bandage off my belly button and it was bleeding. I had to take morphine for the pain it caused. When you have this operation, the quicker you can get off the morphine and start moving around the better, but after the vomiting and the pain it caused, Ive had to go back on the morphine. It makes me feel awful, really lethargic. Emma, who works at the YMCA in Cardf, said: I told my mother what happened and so she checked her chicken and it was the same.  Her mother then took the packets - which had three days left before the use by date was up, on October  - to nearby Treorchy Iceland. They wouldnt give my mother a refund and they took the chicken from her. She then phoned customer services where they still refused to refund the cost and said theyd give her the equivalent back on her Iceland card. I just couldnt believe they didnt give her the money back. They were meant to be fresh chickens, its not like they had a yellow sticker on the packet or it was the middle of summer.  In follow up calls to the Port Talbot Iceland store, Emma also discovered that the message about the chicken had not been relayed to them from the Treorchy branch. A spokeswoman for Iceland Foods Ltd said: Iceland takes all complaints about our food quality extremely seriously and we are sorry that this product appears to have fallen short of both our and the customer’s expectations and a detailed investigation is already underway. We have been in touch with Ms Drew and requested her to contact our Customer Care department, where we can apologise for the distress this situation has caused and we will ensure a full refund and goodwill gesture is arranged.

Transgender siblings Jack and Jace Grafe, , used to cry themselves to sleep and prayed to wake up as boys when they were children. They started le as Jaclyn and Jenner in June , and grew up in a conservative Christian home. Jack and Jace grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, before moving to Monroe, Georgia. They came out at the age of  and are now transitioning as a duo in a rare case. The twins, who have the same DNA, have grown facial hair since they began taking testosterone in April  and underwent chest surgery in August.  Now the criminal justice graduates, who both work in law enforcement, have shared their extraordinary story in a bid to inspire others. Jack, a deputy sherfs officer, said: As a kid I would cry and pray to God that I would wake up in a male body, not even understanding that being transgender was a thing. Now, I am the happiest with myself that I have been in my entire le. That uncomfortable feeling we had before has completely gone. When we came out, it was to our whole family - mum, dad and our older sister.  Our parents had never seen anything like it. They have never experienced gay or transgender people and my dad is a pastor. We live in Georgia. At work I have had my fair share of people calling me a s*** - she, he, it. Usually they just dont understand. People still refer to us as female. Whenever I hear she or her it is like a kick in the stomach. It hurts but I get it. At a young age, I was skeptical of it myself. For some people, it is a hard pill to swallow. There are times when I wish I was just born - and I dont mean this in a negative way -but normal, and that I was biologically male.  People say, You will never be able to change your chromosomes, you can only change the outside. There are still times when I come home and break down. Jace, who is also a deputy officer and just started in the police academy, added: Honestly, the twin thing has helped. If I was to go back to when I was  or  I would never think in a million years that I would have got to this point. It was a fantasy and I always wished it was going to happy but I wasnt brave enough. I didnt have the guts. Being a twin means I dont feel alone. Somebody  is experiencing the exact same things as I am going through and that made me stronger.  Growing up, the Grafe girls wore boyish clothes, assumed the role of dad or brother when playing house and, as teenagers, had crushes on female classmates. But they also attended a strict religious school and say they ran the risk of being thrown outthey also revealed their feelings so didn’t tell anyone - not even each other. Then, at the age of , the twins began attending cosplay conventions where they dressed up as male characters - something they both say “felt natural”. When they finished high school they hacked off their hair and they later came out to one another, firstly as gay aged  and two years later as transgender.  Five years on Jace, of Athens, Georgia, is dating Emory College student Jess Smith, , and Jack is engaged to bakery manager Maygon Arrington, , whom he lives with in nearby Monroe, Georgia. Jack said: It was even hard to tell each other that we liked girls, but when I told Jace and askedhe would have a dferent opinion of me he was like, ‘No, I feel the same way.’ “When he said ‘me too’ I felt relieved and not alone any more. It was scary. I was honestly terried.” Jace added: “I felt the same way about the whole thing. We talked to each other about everything but this was the one subject we were awkward about. We were raised in a really religious household and didnt want to tell each other how we were feeling because we were scared the other would judge us.  “I was scared because I held my twins opinion higher than anybody  sohe didnt accept me I would be devastated. “At one point I even tried to date a guy to seethe feelings would go away but they didn’t.“I found out Jack was transgender through a Facebook post on his profile, which was specically for our cosplay friends and had no family.“I was like, ‘If you feel like this why didn’t you tell me ’ He said it was awkward, that it was much more than saying, ‘Oh, I like girls.’ “I said, ‘Well,you talked to me you would have known that that is how I feel as well.’ “After that we decided to refer to ourselves as brothers and asked our cosplay friends to refer to us as male.” Despite not coming out until adulthood and keeping their gender identity secret from each other, both twins felt the same way - that they were male, not female. Recent studies suggest identical twins are more likely to simultaneously experience gender dysphoria than non-identical twins. Of  monozygotic or identical twins,  per cent were concordant for gender identity disorder, according to a literature review published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. None of the  dizygotic - non-identical - twins were concordant, suggesting a possible genetic or biological link with being transgender. As well as identying as men at work and home, the Grafe twins have been legally recognized as male by the state as of September . They were permitted to change the gender marker on their driving licenses after undergoing chest surgery side by side on August  at Georgia Plastic Surgery. Dr Sheldon Lincenberg removed their breast tissue and contoured their chests to make the area appear more masculine.  Their identity is set inside themselves, Dr. Lincenberg told Fox . Theyre not trying to change that. They just want the world to see them as they are. Jack added: It was like a weight lted off my shoulders.

And apparently he plays old school video games, too.  He’s also “funny as hell”, apparently.

The Duchess of Sussex was also snapped tenderly placing a palm on her stomach as she strolled hand-in-hand with her husband in the glorious sunshine. After leaving Sydney, where they launched the Invictus Games, they travelled to Hervey Bay, in Queensland, and on to Fraser Island. Meghan spent Monday at the exclusive Kingfisher Bay Resort on Fraser Island, which offers an in-house spa with pregnancy-approved treatments. On Monday night Harry and Meghan, a week into their first major international tour, stayed over on Fraser Island.  They stayed in a tree-top villa on the island, situated off Australia’s eastern Queensland coast, which is also known as Kgari - paradise. The stunning setting encompasses the world’s largest sand island, stretching  miles, and including incredible viewpoints and ribbons of coloured sand. The Unesco ecotourism destination has picturesque beaches and swimming sites at Lake McKenzie, Lake Wabby and other freshwater pools for the royals to enjoy. Having felt some tiredness from the beginning of the hectic tour schedule and the jet lag of the journey Down Under, Meghan elected to sit out some engagements on Sunday and Monday. A palace source said: “The last few days of travelling to Australia and then getting fully involved with all the engagements had left the Duchess feeling very tired. “The first trimester for pregnant women is often one of the hardest and it was decided by her and the Duke she needed some well-earned rest. The tour to the rainforest was also incredibly bumpy, so it wouldn’t have been suitable.  “She’s not sick, nor is she exhausted – and she’s really looking forward to the rest of the tour. “The couple were able to have the night to themselves and, no doubt, think about the last week and the next step of their tour, to Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand, which they are both incredibly excited about.” The source added: “This was the perfect time for them to relax together after they announced their fantastic mood and some may say it’s the perfect babymoon destination away from it all.” The resort where Meghan spent the day also offers a Bush Tucker and Bush Medicine tour. The Duchess had earlier made her way to the world heritage-listed island, separating from Prince Harry at Hervey Bay Airport and boarding a high-speed vessel and a popular whale watching boat, Tasman Venture.  K’gari, the traditional name of the island, means “paradise” in the local Butchulla dialect and is a top pick for any expectant mum looking to relax. Meanwhile, Prince Harry took the yellow Fraser Island Explorer Tour Bus to River Heads, where he boarded the public barge for a -minute calm crossing to the pristine and unique Fraser Island and his ultimate goal, Pile Valley, and a rainforest which exists on the sand. It is the only rainforest in the world that grows out of the sand, with towering m tall satinay trees. Harry was welcomed to Pile Valley with a traditional smoking ceremony to ward off evil spirits by members of the Butchulla People, the traditional owners of the land. The Duke was there to mark the forest’s dedication to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy Initiative, a growing area of protected forests across the organisation’s  member states. K’gari has , acres now under protection. Prince Harry’s second stop was the iconic Lake McKenzie, where a Butchulla elder performed a “welcome-to-country” ceremony dipping foliage into the crystal-clear water and washing the Prince’s bare feet.  incredible things to see and do on Fraser Island in Australia The dad-to-be, said: “K’gari means ‘paradise’ and that is certainly what we’ve experienced today, surrounded by the towering kauri pines, ,-year-old satinay trees and ancient giant ferns. “It is up to us now to protect this paradise together – not just because it looks beautul – but because it is an essential part of our existence and will continue to be for our children and their children’s children.” Harry also joked that the plaque he was to unveil, marking the dedication, had already been unveiled by his father in Bundaberg during his tour of Australia in April. He said: “Luckily we are both skilled at unveiling plaques – it runs in the family.” "},{"url":null,"title":"invictus games competitor ptsd comforted","story":"NewsInvictus Games competitor is comforted by teammate after helicopter triggers his PTSDBritish Army hero Paul Guest was upset by the sound of a helicopter before Edwin Vermetten rushed over to help himShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsEdwin Vermetten consoles Paul Guest in the Invictus Games wheelchair tennis open \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Invictus Games competitor rushed to the aid of a teammate suffering PTSD in a scene which reduced spectators to tears.

The Saudi Crown Prince allegedly tried to convince the Washington Post journalist toto Saudi Arabia , but he refused over fears he would be killed.A short time later, Mr Khashoggi, , was allegedly tortured, killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He had made an appointment with the consulate to pick up wedding documents at this time. Intelligence sources claim Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide for Mohammed bin Salman, oversaw the murder by giving orders over Skype.  Qahtani allegedly told his men to dispshyose of Mr Khashoggi, and said: “Bring me the head of the dog.” Qahtani and four other officials have reportedly been sacked over the killing. Officials deny the Saudi Crown Prince was involved in the murder, blaming a “rogue operation”.  However Qahtani himself once said he would never do anything without his boss’s approval. “Do you think I make decisions without guidance  I am an employee and a faithful executor of the orders of my lord the king and my lord the faithful crown prince,” Qahtani tweeted last summer.  It is also alleged that, after Mr Khashoggi was murdered, one of the suspected killers left the building in the dead man’s clothes to make it appear he was still alive. CCTV footage apparently shows Saudi operative Mustafa al-Madani, , in the victim’s shirt, jacket and trousers and wearing a  beard and glasses to look more like him. Authorities in Turkey released the images and said they prove the killing and alleged cover-up were planned.  A Turkish official reportedly said: “His clothes were probably still warm when Madani put them on.” Saudi Arabia’s original response to questions about what happened to Mr Khashoggi after he entered the Saudi consulate was that he definitely left the premises alive. The footage shows Madani – one of the alleged -strong hit squad – going into the front of the building in Istanbul on October  at .am. He had on a blue and white checked top, trainers and is clean shaven. He is thought to have been alongside an alleged accomplice, Saudi’s forensic medicine chief Salah al-Tubaiqi. Mr Khashoggi, who was a Saudi, is seen walking into the building at .pm.  At .pm the footage seemingly shows Madani leaving the back of building while Mr Khashoggi’s worried fiancee waited for the journalist at the front. Madani was wearing Mr Khashoggi’s clothes. But the ploy to throw investigators off the scent was not as clever as it could have been – Madani was wearing the same trainers as when he entered the building. He also has a full head of hair, whereas Mr Khashoggi was balding. As Madani left the consulate building he was accompanied by a man wearing a hoodie and a shirt with hoops on, and was carrying a plastic bag.  It is thought the bag contained the clothes Madani had been wearing on his arrival. Footage shows the two men taking a taxi near to the city’s Sultan Ahmed Mosque. They are seen striding along shortly after pm, by now Madani seems to be carrying Mr Khashoggi’s jacket. Madani and the other man enter a public toilet, emerging again at .pm. Madani is now in the clothes he wore when he entered the consulate.  It is thought his companion’s bag now contains Mr Khashoggi’s clothes. The bag was thrown into a large bin. Yesterday footage also emerged allegedly showing Saudi officials burning documents relating to the journalist at the consulate a day after Mr Khashoggi vanished.  But a Saudi source repeated claims he died after being placed in a “choke hold” during a fist-fight. The Mirror has been told by security sources Saudi spies were plotting for months to kidnap Mr Khashoggi and take him to the capital Riyadh for “questioning and as a message to other opponents”.

She was jailed for posing nude inside the Karnak Temple Complex near the Egyptian city of Luxor. The model also took part in a naked photo shoot in Jerusalem with the Wailing Wall in the background - one of the most important sites in Judaism. Marisa, who describes herself as free-spirited and wild-hearted expressionist travelled to Turkey with Australian photographer Jesse Walker.  They embarked on a daring attempt to take a nude picture of Marisa in the Hagia Sophia, a former Byzantine cathedral and Ottoman mosque which is now used as a museum in Istanbul, Turkey. Marisa said: Unlike Egypt, we did not have a solid plan this time. No preparation at all, but endless imagination and a pretty strong foundation. After buying a burka in the Grand Bazaar, the two headed off to the Hagia Sophia. Marisa said: After waiting in a long queue to enter, we were caught off guard with the amount of security cameras there. They literally have every square centimetre covered.  Jesse added: If youve ever been to the Hagia Sophia, you will know theres never a day without thousands of people being around at all times. After concluding that the ideal moment to take the picture would never happen, Marisa nonetheless decided to go for it and to lt up her burka to expose her genital area. Marisa said: We decided to wait for a guided group and while the guide was telling his story and everyone was paying attention, it was game-time.  Jesse added: It was all done very spontaneously. Inside the mosque, we were hidden in plain sight. There is also a serene calmness inside which helped everything unfold the way it was supposed to. We even went back for a second time the next day because we were not happy with the initial shots. However, I did not feel like this was that challenging compared to the rooftop shot overlooking the Mosque. For that shot to happen, a lot of planning and coordinating went into it. Luckily we have some excellent connections in Istanbul, without them it most definitely would not have been possible. However, the pair said they had a near brush with the Turkish authorities after cops visited their Istanbul hotel and interrogated staff a day after they left for another spot in Turkey. Marisa and Jesse managed to perform a photoshoot in the surreal landscape of Cappadocia, famous for its cave-like dwellings where many people still live, but had to cancel their idea for another shoot at a historical sight due to the heightened security presence. Marisa said: I think the authorities knew we were in town since we took a plane there. They would not move away from us. We never had the chance to take any of the shots we had in mind.  At one point, the two said they were even followed by an armed guard constantly walking a metre behind them without uttering a word. Marisa said: As soon as we arrived at the location, the guy gestured that he was watching us, and then pointed to a group of armed men on the hills. It was like something from a movie. Jesse took a photo of one of the guys to seethey were carrying guns. They were. Even though they felt like they were followed for the entire duration of their trip, both Marisa and Jesse managed to leave the country safely. Marisa said: Jesse and I like to think of ourselves as a modern day Bonnie and Clyde on a James Bond mission, loving every minute for the danger that continuously presents itself to us. Jesse added: It can be extremely testing mentally, physically and also between us, but it is always a real adventure.

The video shows the man asking his foreign love interest to marry him and yelling: I have money. He bought his lover an orange Lamborghini and asked her to meet him in a crowded square. He then puts on a small fireworks display before handing her a large bouquet of roses and saying: Marry me.  But things certainly do not go according to plan with the woman hesitating slightly before turning him down. The frustrated man then points at the Italian sports car and claims: I bought your favourite sports car for you. But the woman can be heard politely rejecting him in English, saying: Im sorry, I dont want to. Im so sorry. In one final attempt, the man then yells: I have money. But that doesnt sway her either.

The Universal Credit system is unsustainable.“We have folk using the food bank or soup kitchen who never needed help in the past.“It does not surprise me that there has been an increase in the number of people seeking assistance from CAB.“I think people are beginning to realise that something has to change, but I don’t know how.”Universal Credit is paid monthly and includes money to help people cover their rent.Tracy McNally, director of Dundee CAB, said: “The idea was to make the experience of budgeting feel the same as whether a household is in or out of work.“Universal Credit also makes the assumption that claimants will have to get better at budgeting. However,there are any unexpected expenditures, they are unlikely to have money put aside to deal with this. We have no local statistics available to evidence this is due to UC, but it does coincide with the roll–out in Dundee.”Shelter Scotland reports that many people in the city seek debt advice in order to “help keep a roof over their heads”.Alison Watson, deputy director, said: “Demand for our services in Dundee remains high and we hear every day from people on low incomes struggling to meet their housing costs. People are struggling because of the high cost of housing, stagnant wages, zero-hours contracts, harsh welfare reforms and the roll-out of the flawed Universal Credit system.”A report published by Citizens Advice Scotland shows that, across the country, there has been a % increase in demand for advice on rent arrears between  and last year.The charity is now calling for a “halt and fix” to Universal Credit.A spokesman for the UK Government’s Department for Work and Pensions said: “Rent arrears are complicated and they cannot be attributed to a single cause.#Our research shows that many people join Universal Credit with pre-existing arrears, but the proportion falls by a third after four months.“Managed payments to landlords are available as part of the Alternative Payment Arrangements in Universal Credit, to minimise the risk of claimants failing to pay their rent.“We are rolling out the Universal Credit landlord portal to social landlords, which is helping us target support for vulnerable people.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b151813bf9cf.jpg ","title":"new led lights to be installed at dundees caird hall","story":"The exterior of one of Dundee’s most famous and prominent buildings is to be upgraded as part of the city’s £ billion Waterfront development.New LED-illuminated signage is to be installed on the south facade of the Caird Hall, the city’s century-old concert and event venue.The writing, which will display the building’s name, will closely match that in place on the north side.More ambitious plans to illuminate the entirety of the south facade have been put on the back-burner because of financial constraints.The city council said the Grade-A listed building needed to be “enhanced” after the Waterfront development “opened up” the back of the building.An application prepared by the council’s city engineer details the proposals, which have been passed by planning officers.

Brendan Rodgers has such a good knowledge that he knew about me as a player.“Steven knew about me through our agent.“But it was great to see the two of them at close quarters, how they handled training and how they prepared for a game.“Any chance you get to see and speak to people like that first hand is really valuable.“He has changed things from a club that was finding its way to him pulling it in the right direction.“This game is more dficult than it might have been a year or two ago because he has put a belief back into the club and the players – in fact it looks like he’s demanded it.“Any time you play Rangers in a semi-final in Glasgow it will be tough.“It’s the first time he’s had them in a semi-final and he’ll be wanting to get them to the final so they’ll be ready for it as well.“You always want your former clubs to win. I won’t make bold statements saying Aberdeen will win.“But they will be ready for the game and a good performance can take them to the final.”Glass played his part at this stage of the competition  years ago as he set up Billy Dodds’ second goal at Hampden as Roy Aitken’s side reached the final.The -year-old who also played for Newcastle, Watford, Hibs and Dunfermline during his career, was a young player not long in the Dons team and enjoyed the period.He added: “They were exciting times because I was a young player coming into the first team.“I was learning my trade and enjoying playing big games.“You were going into them trying to do as best I could for the team.“I was lucky that I managed to do well, particularly in that cup run. It was an enjoyable time to be there with the atmosphere and big games that we were playing at that time.“We had a really good team with really good professionals around me. I was fortunate coming into the team that I had so many good professionals around me who knew how to handle a young player to get the best out of me for the team.“That semi-final was enjoyable and I managed to make one of the goals and we got to the final which is the number one thing when you’re playing in a semi final.”Looking at this weekend’s game, Glass can see similarities between  and the current day.He said: “It’s not dissimilar to when we went to play that semi-final in .“The outsider probably thinks Rangers are favourites – but Aberdeen will have a determination because they are trying to make a final.“It’s not expectation that wins semi-finals, it’s the performance on the night.“The league performances under Derek McInnes have been spectacular. He’s also put a trophy in the cabinet which not many Aberdeen managers have done in recent times.“This is another opportunity to get to a final and then you start talking about trophies.“If they keep knocking on the door and getting to finals then he is probably one of the most successful managers Aberdeen have had throughout the club’s history. It’s another target for them to aim at – I know he will have them ready for it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lovely place to live for o o 134750","story":"This two bedroom ground floor apartment is situated in the attractive village of Blackburn just  miles west of Aberdeen and  miles north to the market town of Inverurie where you will find an abundance of quality retailers # and there is a £, cashback incentive*.The accommodation comprises: entrance hallway with storage cupboard, a generously proportioned lounge to the rear of the property with French doors opening on to the patio and rear garden, a modern kitchen with a good range of wall and base units, integrated oven hob and extractor fan with freestanding fridge freezer, washer dryer and dishwasher, two bedrooms and a family bathroom with bath, over shower and vanity storage.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

 of them came home.The symbolism and signicance of the cascade at the Church, as well as a smaller tribute of knitted poppies hung from the town-centre Pant Well, isnrsquot lost on Mr Deacon.He added: ldquoThis Parish Church is probably where a lot of the young men who went off to war would have come in the days before they left.ldquoThe Pant Well is also signicant as they would have left Selkirk

or  volunteers who spent much of the summer producing the eye-catching red poppies.Several white poppies, in remembrance of the conscientious objectors, were also produced.Over the past two weekends the poppies were tied to military netting within the Parish Church hall by around  volunteers.Kay Ross told us: ldquoThis has been a magnicent achievement by so many people and it is a fitting tribute to the people who went off to war.Joining Mr Deacon on Friday to help with the draping of the cascade was a fellow former soldier Sandy Monks.And four of the townrsquos retained firefighters were also on hand to prevent any snags.Organisers are planning further commemorations in the run up to Remembrance on Sunday, November .As well as a unique parade from the Parish Church to the War Memorial on

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness.

Before  there was not a single national referendum in the UK, and yet in the years since therersquos been a grand total of ten and the rate seems to be speeding up. Itrsquos asa country thatrsquos based, wisely, on the principle of representative democracy has developed, worryingly, a fetish for direct democracy through popular votes on single issues.The reason we should be worried by this trend is obvious: politicians. Referendums are sold as a way to resolve important public issues, but what theyrsquore usually really about is petty private disputes. Harold Wilson held the first national referendum in  not because he particularly cared about Europe but because Labour was ided and he needed to see off a rebellion by the hard-left Eurosceptic Tony Benn. And it worked: had Bennrsquos side won the referendum, he might well have gone on to take the Labour leadership.The same applies to pretty much every other referendum held since, particularly the ones ordered by one of their greatest fans, David Cameron. In , he ordered a poll on the voting system not because he wanted to discuss reform, but because he needed to keep Nick Clegg on side. Then, in , there was a vote on Scottish independence not because Mr Cameron wanted to encourage a constitutional debate, but because he wanted to arrest a rise in support for the SNP. And finally, in , Mr Cameron ordered a vote on Europe not because he was worried about the status quo, but because his party was ided. He did it all because he thought it would be good for his career and because he thought he would win.This is basically how every referendum has always worked, whether itrsquos in the UK or where: a politician has a problem they need to fix, or an enemy they want to undermine, or they want to attract support for a decision they have already made and so they order a referendum. Not even referendums that are seemingly uncontroversial are immune, such as the  vote on Scottish devolution. Do you really think Labour promised the referendum for any other reason than to avoid the Tories being able to say that a vote for Labour in the  election was a vote to break up the Union There are plenty of other questions we should be asking ourselves about how referendums work. For instance,they are supposed to be festivals of democracy, how come they often end up being about one or two iniduals or hinging on what a handful of politicians say in the newspapers, or write on the side of a bus  In what way, exactly, is it democratic to give disproportionate power to a small elite of pushy alpha males, often pushing the same dubious points  And how is it a good idea to reduce complicated questions to yes or no  And why do referendums that are apparently designed to solve problems so often create new ones For those who support continued membership of the EU, the truth of all of this can be seen in the  referendum and its chaotic aftermath Unionists can see it too in the constant constitutional agitating of the SNP ever since the  vote. Part of the explanation is the relatively close results ndash Leavers attracted . per cent of the vote in  and Unionists . per cent in  which means itrsquos been hard to portray the results of the referendums as the end of the matter. Instead, referendums just beget more referendums.The obvious answer would be to require bigger majorities. In the US, constitutional change needs support from two-thirds of the Senate and the House of Representatives ndash so why not consider something similar for the UK  Certainly, requiring two-thirds support at Westminster and Holyrood would avoid the situation in which the SNP can claim to have a mandate for a referendum on independence on the basis of a slim majority at Holyrood even though there is little support for it in the general population.And a super-majority in parliament is not the only reform we should consider. The  referendum on Scottish devolution is notorious for being set up to fail with a requirement that  per cent of the eligible electorate had to vote for change and I donrsquot think anyone would ever suggest a repeat of that. But therersquos a strong argument for a referendum option to require support from two-thirds of those who vote. That way, the result can properly be seen as reflecting the popular will and avoids the kind of close outcome that only leads to more trouble.Obviously, all of these problems would apply to the so-called peoplersquos vote that the protesters were calling for in London, but until we can properly reform the process, it looks like one of the few possible routes to a rethink. The concept of a second referendum is also another of the reforms that should be considered for the future. Ideally, referendums would only be heldthere were detailed plans or legislation on the proposed changes, andno such plan exists, there would need to be a further referendum later. That would mean we could avoid a repeat of  when we all voted yes or no to a plan that didnrsquot exist. However, the bad news for Scottish nationalists is that it would also mean that , one day, there is an indyref, there would have to be an indyref as well."},{"url":null,"title":"tories-demand-secret-snp-government-files-on-indyref2","story":"The Scottish Toriesdemandedthe material, produced by officials since, bepublishedafter discovering its existence through a freedom ofinformationrequest.The party said the files, some covering legal advice, showed a referendum was ldquonever off the SNPrsquos table, and have now lodged an appeal with Scotlandrsquos information tsar.However the depth and precise subject matter within the documents remains unclear.The Tories made their FoI request on August , asking the Scottish Government for ldquodetails of any briefings by civil servants or documents provided to ministers in  or  on the topic of a second independence referendum.Ministers replied in late September, refusing to disclose material on the grounds it would prejudice the conduct of public affairs to reveal sensitive government material.The government also said some material was exempt because it involved ldquolegal advice.The only material released a single letter from then finance and constitution secretary Derek Mackay to a Holyrood committee about the government publishing an analysis of responses to its draft referendum bill consultation in June last year.Following a challenge to the decision, the government has now revealed more information.It said that, in addition to the previous letter, it could ldquoconfirm that  other documents were identied as being within scope of [the] request.ldquoThese were provided from civil servants to Ministers as part of their normal duties supporting Ministers.

The finding of greater effects in female foetuses is interesting given that thyroid disease is around seven times more common in women than men.ldquoOverall this study shows that the motherrsquos lestyle choices, cigarette smoking and being overweight, are affecting the development of her childrenrsquos thyroid systems, probably predisposing them to disease after birth.The work was funded by the UK Medical Research Council, NHS Grampian Endowments and the Natural Science  Engineering Research Council of Canada."},{"url":null,"title":"peoples-vote-would-deliver-even-bigger-leave-vote-claims-karen-bradley","story":"Restating her opposition to a so-called Peoples Vote on the ultimate Brexit deal, Karen Bradley, who voted Remain in , insisted it would undermine the democratic process.Ms Bradley, who was addressing a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly[BIPA] in London, said the people had already spoken.\"From my knocking on doors, there would be a bigger vote for Leave,\" she declared, insisting: \"The fact is the people spoke.

Two thirdssaid rated the chances of them cycling more in the next two to three years from unlikely to extremely unlikely. This rose to  per cent when people were askedthey would consider cycling for most regular journeys.Katharine Brough, head of behaviour change at Cycling Scotland, said it was the first time the organisation had looked in depth at what puts people off getting on their bikes: from a preference for car journeys, to safety considerations and lestyle choices ndash  per cent of respondents simply said they were not the kind of person who rides a bike.Ms Brough said: \"A signicant number of respondents either do not know how to cycle or do not feel fit enough.\"Close to two-thirds of non-cyclists were discouraged from taking up cycling as they felt they didnrsquot fit their image of a cyclist and didnrsquot know anyone who cycled. The cost of buying a bike can also be a barrier.\"More than  per cent of parents said their childrencycled at least once a week, she added. \"This is a big contrast to the number of adult cyclists and we are keen to explore when, where and crucially why this drop-off occurs.\"She said the study would be used to develop programmes to help more people take up cycling as a viable form of transport and exercise.\"This research begins a longer-term study into attitudes to cycling in Scotland. It will help us to develop our programmes and work in partnership with others to support parents, students, commuters, young and older people to access the lelong benefits of cycling, she said..The report also found that regular cyclists currently tend to come from the highest socio-economic background. While the survey found cycling was widely seen as a healthy transport option and a better choice for the environment, and % agreed that Scotland would be a better placemore people cycled  per cent said it wasnt practical.Asked for changes which would make them consider saddling up, non-cyclists said having fewer vehicles on the roads, more cycle lanes or traffic-free routes would make a dference.More than  people were interviewed for the study which will influence Cycling Scotlands future work.

The report says their careers are often hindered by sexual harassment, a lack of opportunities for progression, or discrimination related to pregnancy.Meanwhile gender pay gaps show ldquoshocking levels of inequality in how womenrsquos work is valued, the Commission said.Disabled people are twice as likely to be jobless, and are seeing the gulf between their pay and the rest of the workforce grow wider, while ethnic minorities are twice as likely to be unemployed or living in poverty.Young people are most likely to be unemployed and are disproportionately in insecure jobs.Lesley Sawers, Scotland Commissioner for the EHRC, said the review showed limited progress in some areas since the previous review in , but this was slow, and neither consistent nor widespread.She added: \"Despite efforts made by the Scottish Government and many others the same problems which have been highlighted in previous reviews are still apparent.\"The stark reality of inequality in Scotland today is that too often people are unable to realise their full potential, are excluded from positions of influence, and experience prejudice and discrimination in daily le.\"The report draws on public data to assess what progress is being made in a range of areas.In the workplace, it warns women, disabled people, young people and ethnic minorities are still not being treated fairly. As well as being more likely to be out of work, women are more likely to be in part time work.Just days after local authority care workers in Glasgow go on strike over the failure to resolve their equal pay claims, the EHRC report will warn that the gender pay gap has changed very little in recent years.Women continue to be under-represented in the senior ranks of many workplaces, even in education, health and other areas where they account for the majority of the workforce, it says.The commission claims such discrimination has a direct impact on levels of poverty, which is getting worse on nearly all measures.The majority of children living in poverty are now from working households, it points out , while women and disabled people are most at risk from the worst poverty.People with mental health problems and people from ethnic minority backgrounds are also more likely to be poor.The report says the UK Government should take much of the blame for the poverty which \"blights the lives\" of too many Scots. \"Unfairness is hardwired into the UK Government tax and spend policies, with some groups ndash black women, Bangladeshis and disabled people ndash suffering disproportionately,\" it says.On sexual harassment, the report claims says a lack of research means we dont know how many people have been sexually harassed in Scottish workplaces, but ious surveys suggest anything between one in three and one in ten workers have experienced sexual harassment, with one study suggesting  per cent of women and six per cent of men believe they have been sexually harassed at work.While nearly all employersclaimed to agree that it was in the interests of their organisation to support pregnant women and those on maternity leave, nearly three-quarters of mothersreported having a negative or possibly discriminatory experience when they were pregnant, on maternity leave, or ing to work from maternity leave.The EHRC says the UK Government should introduce a right for all workers to request flexible working, from the day employment starts, to help reduce the gender pay gap and support more disabled people into work. Currently people who have been employed for less than  weeks have no right to ask to work flexible hours.But it also says Scottish ministers could do more.While praising the Scottish Governments commitment to a fair and inclusive jobs market, and increased government-funding for early learning and childcare, the report concludes more can be done.It calls for the government to require Scottish Councils and other public authorities to publish action plans about how they are monitoring ethnicity and disability, and how they relate to employees chances of being recruited, staying in work and progressing up the career ladder.To tackle workplace harassment, the report says the UK Government should introduce a mandatory duty on employers to take reasonable steps to protect workers from harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation in the workplace and should extend the time limit for bringing cases to employment tribunals for discrimination and harassment to six months.A Scottish Government spokesmansaid:ldquoEquality is at the heart of our vision for a fairer Scotland and despite equalities legislation being largely reserved, we continue to take decisive action on this issue.\"Our Programme for Government makes clear our determination to improve the position of women in the workplace.

This would be more similar to the experiences of people in the workplace where assessment is focussed on how iniduals can learn from that point forward.Dr Janet Brown, chief executive of the SQA, said examiners would study the report, but did not give a commitment to reduce the frequency of essay writing.She said: ldquoItrsquos appropriate that we engage fully with young people and take on their views as they have a very signicant stake in how qualications and assessment need to change to reflect our future society and economy.ldquoOur qualications and assessments are part of the le experience of all young people in Scotland, but this le experience is changing in ways that were dficult to predict only a few years ago, and will continue to change with consequences that we cannot yet foresee.Ms Brown said the SQA would develop a new approach to assessing competence in wider skills as a result of the report and would continue to consult with young people in future.Louise Macdonald, chief executive of Young Scot, said: ldquoWersquore very pleased the SQA is taking on board the thoughts, feeling and experiences of young people from across Scotland on such an important issue."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-suggests-extending-transition-period-might-be-preferable-to-remove-irish-backstop-impasse","story":"In a Commons statement following last weeks EU summit in Brussels, the Prime Minister suggested there were now two main options to resolve the Irish backstop issue the last main obstacle to getting a deal with  per cent of the withdrawal agreement completed.With a Northern Ireland-only backstop off the table as far as Britain was concerned, Mrs May claimed there had been a ldquosubstantial sht in Brusselsrsquo position on the UKrsquos plan for a UK-EU joint customs territory and that the EU was now actively working on the proposal.She also said the alternative to having a backstop was to extend the transition or implementation period, which is due to end in December .While she said she was not committed to extending the transition period and remained confident a deal on the future partnership could be agreed by the end of it, the PM explained how there were ldquolimited circumstances in which it could be argued that an extension ldquomight be preferablewe were certain it was only for a short time.She pointed out: ldquoA short extension to the implementation period would mean only one set of changes for businesses at the point we move to the future relationship.

The teacher who I know is just one statistic among the many parking attendants punched or nurses harassed.However, what complicates the issue for the teacher is that the child who routinely assaults her suffers from autism ndash and displays extreme behavioural problems, including physical aggression to staff and pupils.The experience of the teacher raises an issue which is almost taboo within the worlds of education, government and politics ndash the abject failure of the policy of inclusion in its present form in Scotland.The concept of inclusion is simple and laudable ndash that all children regardless of physical or learning disabilities should be educated in mainstream schools. However, in practice, the policy is inoperable with the current level of funding and staffing.Teachers know this to be true, and so does the Government. Only recently, an anonymous letter to education secretary John Swinney, from a primary school teacher, went viral. In the letter, the teacher laid out what was wrong with inclusion ndash one passage described how pupils had to be evacuated while a child ldquotrashed the classroom ndash and explained that the letter had to be anonymous as they feared consequences for saying the unsayable.ldquoNow that there are very few specialist schools, they wrote, ldquoteachers are feeling the effects of inclusion on a daily basis. This policy, whilst admirable in intention, does not work as it is drastically underfunded. In my school, it is fairly common for teachers to be physically assaulted by children whose needs cannot be met due to the inadequate level of funding. The teacher nailed the cause too, blaming a ldquolack of resources and support from government.Inclusion highlights a recurring theme in modern Scottish society: the idea that you can build utopia without hard work thatyou just think good thoughts and say good words, that good things will happen. Utopia, however, costs money.Letrsquos leave utopia aside for a moment, though, and get into the dystopia that is modern schooling in Scotland when it comes to inclusion. One teacher told me that at their school they have not had additional support needs stafffor the last  years. These ASNs are school staff trained to deal with all manner of ldquobarriers to learning ndash whether itrsquos cerebral palsy, dyslexia, or autism.So, as a nation, wersquove decided ndash rightly ndash that all children, no matter what dficulties they face in le, will be educated in a mainstream school. However, we are not paying for the essential staff needed to make the policy work. One cannot say ldquobuild me a house and expect a house to appearno bricklayers are hired.In most schools, support for learning staff ndash what was once called classroom assistants ndash are filling in the aching black hole caused by the lack of ASNs. Classroom assistants, however, are meant to help teachers in all sorts of ways ndashthey are not there just to paper over the cracks in the inclusion policy.Letrsquos take this example of what is happening in schools: therersquos a class with about  pupils ndash itrsquos in a poor inner city area. One child has severe behavioural problems, one child has dyslexia, and one child has minor physical disabilities ndash problems with balance and walking. There are also at least six children in the class for whom English is a second language, including pupils who are refugees and have experienced war. There are eight other classes in the school, with a roll of around  ndash all with pretty much the same makeup. There are four classroom assistants ndash support for learning workers ndash and no ASNs.In this scenario, everyone loses: the majority of pupils have to put up with disruption and are starved of staff time the pupils with special needs, but not behavioural problems, come second in line to those children who are disruptive and the disruptive pupils with behavioural problems are simply managed by untrained staff, not truly helped by those with the skills to better their educational experience. Meanwhile, the staff ndash both teachers and support workers ndash are run ragged by a policy that sounds great on paper for a politician but is hell on earth when put into practice.When asked, most teachers seem to agree that inclusion is good in theory ndash they want schools to be inclusive of all children ndash but it is a disaster in practice because there is not enough money or staff to resource it and make it work. There are therefore only two solutions: abandon the policy, or fund it properly.To abandon the policy would be extremely expensive ndash new specialist schools would need to be built, new specialist staff would need to be trained and hired. Given that many schools have no money for specialist staff, one would imagine that an entire new programme of building specialist schools might also be out of reach. Scrapping the policy would also send out a cruel message: that mainstream schooling is not for those with any form of special needs.

In the main six weeks of the season in July and August it is crazy.ldquoThe challenge for VisitScotland and others is to even out the number of visitors.ldquoThere is the potential for good all year round tourism, but the main season is already incredibly busy. I think the area can take more - but itrsquos a case of when.Concerns after last years peak season prompted the Scottish Government to launch a pound million rural tourism infrastructure fund to help ease the pressure on the region.Photographer Kevin Arrowsmith who lives at Durness said: \"It is ironic that we have talked for so many years about attracting more people to the area and now we have them, but at times too many of them.ldquoPlanned tourism is what is needed. I think an area can attract too many people because the infrastructure cannot support the numbers.Lonely Planet recommends that May and June are ldquoeasily the best months to visit the area due to good weather and the wildflowers on display - as well as to avoid the dreaded midges.It also recommends ldquomonster hunting for Nessie in Loch Ness a day trip to Culloden and exploring the islands of the Outer Hebrides.The Highlands and Islands ranked ahead of the Russian Far East Gujarat, India Manitoba, Canada Normandy, France and Elqui Valley, Chile on the list.Tourism Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see the Highlands and Islands receive recognition for its breath-taking scenery, history and heritage. I am sure the Lonely Planetrsquos support will help to inspire and captivate the imaginations of new visitors.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland Chief Executive, said the recommendation would put the Highlands and Islands ldquoin the global spotlight once again.He said: ldquoI am thrilled, though not entirely surprised, to discover that Scotlandrsquos Highlands and Islands have appeared in this prestigious list.ldquoThis stunning part of Scotland punches well above its weight on the world stage, as a thriving holiday destination for people from both across the globe and the UK, as well as a popular location for film production companies looking for a beautul backdrop for their next blockbuster.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that we donrsquot become complacent, as we need to continue to provide world-class experiences, events and attractions to keep up with the ever-changing visitor demands."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-focusing-on-politics-does-equal-pay-women-no-favours","story":"Take Glasgow: primary schools across the city are currently in shut down while care services are being severely disrupted after thousands of female workers downed tools in protest at the local authorityrsquos apparent lack of progress towards honouring an equal-pay settlement they were promised would be made by the end of this year. Caterers, home carers and cleaners have all walked out for  hours, with , of them taking part in what is being dubbed the largest equal-pay strike ever to take place in the UK.While it is clear that the women have widespread public support, much of the debate around the strike has centred on why their trade unions - the GMB and Unison - have chosen to help them stage their walk-out now. With the first equal-pay claim against the council being lodged  years ago, the suspicion is that the Labour-supporting unions are out to make trouble for the SNP, which has committed to resolving the issue after inheriting it from Labour following last yearrsquos local elections.It is an easy case to make. After all, the unions could have helped organise a walk-out  years ago, when it was clear that a new pay structure adopted by the then Labour-run council valued male-dominated jobs more highly than those done mostly by women. Or at numerous points since, as Labour politicians persisted in mounting what now seems obvious was an unwinnable legal challenge to the councilrsquos equal-pay obligations.Claims from the trade unions, which are by nature deeply political organisations, that there are no politics at play here are a little hard to swallow, especially as one of the GMBrsquos most vocal equal-pay campaigners - regional organiser Rhea Wolfson - is standing as a Labour candidate at the next General Election. The SNP made settling equal pay a key plank of its Glasgow manesto, which helped win Susan Aitken, a self-professed feminist who speaks eloquently about supporting her cityrsquos female workers, her role as council leader. Likewise, helping to organise a strike that will undoubtedly be painted as the ground on which this battle was won, will do Ms Wolfsonrsquos political ambitions no harm.Yet compelling as these arguments are, the problem with focusing on political machinations is that it risks ignoring the real driving force behind the industrial action: the women themselves. For them this strike isnrsquot about scoring political points or furthering political careers, it is about showing that they will no longer take being discriminated against because they are women, regardless of the form that discrimination takes.Indeed, while at its heart this dispute is about the iniquity of supposedly feminine jobs being deemed less valuable than masculine ones, it is also about the lack of options female workers have for staging a protest. While a strike by refuse collectors or gravediggers would be viewed as nothing more than an inconvenience, it has historically been seen as beyond the pale for carers or classroom assistants, whose jobs demand that feminine traits like empathy and compassion be on display at all times, to engage in such actions.Home carer and Unison member Amanda Green spoke movingly on that point yesterday when she told BBC Radio rsquos Womenrsquos Hour programme that the women of Glasgow have been made to feel that because of the type of jobs they do they do not have the right to go on strike. Viewed like that, perhaps the reason the women have not taken action before now has less to do with the unions not wanting to go up against the Labour Party and more to do with the workers themselves feeling duty bound not to walk out on the people they tend to on a daily basis.Now they have taken action, the question is where do things go from here. While the strike has allowed the women to finally take a stand - and has ensured their plight is known well beyond the confines of Glasgow political circles - from the councilrsquos point of view it will not make any dference to the way their settlement is handled. Making the authorityrsquos case on Womenrsquos Hour, Ms Aitken stressed that the action ldquowonrsquot change the outcome of negotiations between the two sides, with the council preparing to pay a fair settlement ldquovery soon.Yet unless all parties can get round the table to have the ldquomeaningful negotiations the womenrsquos representatives have been calling for, that process will stall and the claims - all , of them - will end up back in the Employment Tribunal to be settled on a case-by-case basis. Given theof time that would take to complete, such an outcome can be in nobodyrsquos interests.The strike has allowed both sides to flex their muscles, with the women demonstrating that they are prepared to do whatever is required in order to be treated on a par with their male counterparts and the council showing that it will hold its ground regardless of the cost. Now everyone knows where they stand, is there any reason this matter canrsquot be settled once and for all "},{"url":null,"title":"review-david-byrne-sse-hydro-glasgow-five-stars","story":"David ByrneSSE Hydro, GlasgowKeith Brucefive starsOF COURSE, everyone who had seen this show in the more intimate environment of Glasgow Royal Concert Hall claimed that had been the better night, although it was also telling that a good few had ed to enjoy it again only four months later.And, as far as those of us who were unable to be there in June could tell, this incarnation of David Byrnersquos American Utopia was almost exactly the same, to the extent that its architect felt obliged to point out minor iations from his last visit.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

But the work is very intensive and requires the repeated closure of the vital road link multiple times every day.A road-rail ersion onto the neighbouring railway tracks has been created to allow key through-access for cars but this can only operate during gaps in rail services ndash causing serious disruption to drivers who miss those windows. At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption. She said bus replacement services would have less of an impact than the road closures.She said: \"Itrsquos been well documented that the current convoy system is having a hugely detrimental impact on pupils attending Plockton High School as well as local businesses.\"The situation is far from ideal. I believe a better solution is that ScotRail and Network Rail should terminate all trains at Strathcarron and for a bus replacement service to operate and call at all stations between Strathcarron and Kyle.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time!

The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue.

Some areas have seen their fast food provision double in the same period.Hungry locals in Glasgow now have more than  dferent outlets to choose from, while those in Edinburgh have risen by more than a third to .It means there are now  takeaways for every , people in Scotland’s largest city and more than ,food-to-go outlets operating across the country.The report comes months after Scottish Government health chiefs announced a crackdown on the promotion of foods high in salt, sugar and fat in a bid to tackle the nation’s obesity epidemic.Two-thirds of Scottish adults are said to be overweight, including  per cent who are defined as obese, according to figures released earlier this year. Campaigners are now calling for local authorities to be given further powers to curb the number of fast food outlets opening in their area.Public health minister Joe Fitzpatrick said “decisive action” was needed to tackle Scotland’s “damaging relationship with junk food” as he launched a masterplan earlier this month.Proposals put out for consultation could see restrictions placed on “supersized” soft drinks, free refills, multi-buys and unhealthy food displays at checkouts.But Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said local councils needed more powers to deny new outlets the opportunity to “prolerate” in areas where there were already large numbers of unhealthy food options.He said: “I’m not surprised about the rise – it’s considerable – and the reason for that. Local government and local boards in Scotland find it a pain to deal with fast food outlets and they don’t have all the powers they need to say no to them.“These are businesses that come into an area, they pay rates, they bring employment and in a lot of cases, they are sourcing local produce.”He continued: “Added to that, they are cheap, convenient, the food comes hot and cooked and for parts of the population they are a necessity. For low-income families, they provide meals that are filling, but not nutritious.“I think Holyrood have made good strides in improving school meals for children in that situation, but they still have to go home, they are just getting the same type of fast food there. All that good work is just going out the window.”Mr Fry added: “We have had years and years of the UK government not wanting to regulate industry and of course industry has just completely taken advantage.”Many councils say they are forced to open up retail premises to fast food firms in a bid to attract footfall back to struggling high streets.In July, councillors in the Scottish Borders – where the presence of takeaways has increased by more than  per cent since  – voted to ease restrictions on new businesses opening in Hawick and Galashiels town centres as part of a one-year pilot scheme. An image of a , calorie ‘crunch box’ containing four dferent battered suppers, chips, onion rings, fritters and a two litre bottle of Irn-Bru from the East West Spice chippie in Greenock went viral after being posted online in August.Scottish Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said: “The signicant increase in takeaways over the last eight years is a worrying trend that suggests to me that SNP Scottish Government public health messages are not being as effective as they could be and that the takeaway food environment in Scotland continues to increase.”He added: “It is clear that local authorities have an important role to play in the local high street mix available, which often drives consumer behaviour and food choices.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Our diet and healthy weight delivery plan contains a package of measures designed to help Scots make healthy choices about their eating habits and live healthier lives. We will shortly publish research on planning and the food environment – an element of which is about the availability of fast food outlets. “This will inform our forthcoming review of Scottish planning policy.“Meanwhile, Food Standards Scotland will soon lead a consultation to inform an out-of-home strategy. “It will include proposals on calorie information for consumers in settings like takeaways.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4818203.1540217419!/image/image.jpg","title":"itv censured over inaccuracies in interview with nicola sturgeon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...ITV have been rapped over an interview with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon where claims were made the SNP would have to impose austerityScotland became independent.The first minister was appearing on Good Morning Britain when host Ben Shephard read out a quote which he said was from the party’s Sustainable Growth Commission report.Shephard claimed the SNP had forecast they would have to impose “austerity policies” and “years of tight public spending”it broke away from the rest of the UK.However, he was quoting from a summary of the Commission Report made by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and not from the report itself.Regulator Ofcom launched an investigation into the broadcast after a viewer complained and have now found that it breached broadcasting guidelines on accuracy and impartiality.: Briefings produced to plan for second referendumMs Sturgeon immediately attempted to correct the error but Ofcom found she was “dismissed or ignored” by Shephard and his co-host Kate Garraway.ITV were forced to make an on air apology following the interview on June  this year.During the interview, Shephard said to Miss Sturgeon: “This report [the Commission Report] actually says that the loss of money from Westminster, were you to get independence, that is created by the Barnett Formula would mean that the SNP would have to impose austerity policies and recommends years of tight public spending to halve Scotland’s deficit and in order to keep the pound.”Ms Sturgeon replied: “The report doesn’t say what you’ve just said. The report explicitly rejects austerity, the report recommends that an independent Scotland should have real terms growth in spending rather than the cuts we’ve seen.”: Theresa May accuses Nicola Sturgeon of betraying ScotlandAt one stage, Shephard waved a piece of paper at Ms Sturgeon and claimed he was reading directly from the report.In their written ruling, Ofcom said: “Mr Shephard was referring to a summary, written by the GMB production team, of a critique of the Commission Report produced by the Institute of Financial Studies. We therefore considered the statement was clearly inaccurate.“We recognised that Ms Sturgeon sought to correct the inaccuracy on a number of occasions during the interview. However, in each case, her correction was either dismissed or ignored by the presenters.“For example, as described above, Mr Shephard responded to Ms Sturgeon’s initial correction by reiterating the original inaccuracy.“Later, when Ms Sturgeon said “the report does not say what you said”, Ms Garraway interrupted and told her to ‘answer my question’.“We considered that the inaccuracy in this case had a signicant impact on the remainder of the interview. This was because viewers would have not known whether Mr Shephard or Ms Sturgeon was accurately reflecting the findings of Commission Report.“This potentially left viewers with an erroneous impression that Ms Sturgeon was either unclear about the contents of the report or deliberately misrepresenting its findings.”ITV said the error “was entirely unintentional and made in the heat of a live broadcast interview”.They added Shephard was reading from briefing notes which had been prepared by the programme’s editorial team which were “insufficiently clearly written”.The broadcaster was also found in breach of guidelines by Ofcom for failing to make the on air apology until four weeks after the interview was broadcast.Their apology read: “On  June we interviewed Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, during which we suggested to her that the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission Report had said austerity measures would be required in the event of Scottish independence.“In fact, the quote that we put to the First Minister was a summary of a critique of the Commission Report made by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, and not a quote from the Commission Report itself. We apologise for this error and for any confusion caused.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “Our investigation found that this programme broke our rules on due accuracy, because the presenter claimed incorrectly that a political strategy report contained a statement it did not.“ITV broadcast an apology four weeks later which we considered was not soon enough after the mistake had been made.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4818298.1540233622!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment brexit requires calm heads not violent rhetoric","story":"Emotions are running high over Brexit but there is a pressing need to calmly assess the facts, rather than ramp up tensions with violent metaphors about Theresa May being stabbed.Emotions are running high. And, to an extent, they should be. Brexit represents a profound change to le in the UK that may have serious effects on the economy, but also on less tangible things like our sense of identity and place in the world. If we do indeed leave the EU in five months’ time, saying the words “I am British” will mean something dferent to the current definition.But, just as The Scotsman recently called for more reason and less passion in the independence debate, the same should be said – and said repeatedly – about Brexit. A “State of the Economy” report, published today by the Scottish Government’s chief economist Dr Gary Gillespie, provides some important facts and reasoned opinions to help prepare for the future. The good news is that Scotland’s GDP is growing and at the strongest annual rate since . The bad news is that “uncertainty” about the terms of the UK’s departure from the EU may hit investment levels as businesses postpone big decisions. Companies may also start stockpiling goods, creating a boom during this financial year that would be “more than offset” by a post-Brexit slump. It is the kind of measured and practical advice that politicians need to know when making decisions about the preparations necessary to smooth the transition.: Leader comment: Independence debate needs more reason, less passionEveryone knows the name of the report’s author and the analysis can be challenged by anyone who cares to do so. Some may insist this is another example of “Project Fear” and continue to put the case for the benefits of Brexit. Passions may run understandably high. But it is important not use language at odds with peaceful democracy, particularly given the rise of the far-right across the West in recent years. The pro-Brexit MPs quoted anonymously as saying Theresa May should “bring her own noose” to a meeting of backbenchers and talked of the imminent moment “when the kne gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted” – adding “she’ll be dead soon” – perhaps thought they were using metaphors like the “Night of the Long Knives”, used to describe Harold Macmillan’s  reshuffle. But the phrase’s origins are deeply sinister, referring to murders carried out by Hitler to ensure his grip on power in pre-war Germany. In light of the murder of Jo Cox MP in  by a far-right extremist, politicians need to be more careful with their words, lest they inspire others to take similar actions.: Theresa May slams ‘dehumanising’ and ‘derogatory’ comments in Brexit row©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4818385.1540285715!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis four huge issues lost in brexit s vast shadow","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...There is only so much bandwidth in government # and the same applies to parliament, politics, the media, and to you, the public, who keep an eye on what politicians get up to.Quite a lot of it has been taken up by Brexit lately. In dferent circumstances, a lot more time and energy could be spent tackling some other big challenges facing the country and the world. Here are a few that might get more attentionit weren’t for the B-word, which will not appear again on this page:Local governmentLocal government is picking up the bill for austerity. The Scottish Government has passed on cuts in its block grant to councils with interest, while in England, the impact has been even greater.Financial pressures that have squeezed services are now being felt in bricks and mortar: a backlog of repairs threatens the People’s Palace and Winter Gardens in Glasgow, while in Edinburgh, the council could close all but two public toilets.Growing social deprivation and falling council tax receipts have led to calls for local authority amalgamations in Glasgow and across Scotland, while in England, one council has gone bust with warnings that more could follow.This should be the level of government closest to the public, where people’s voices are heard on issues affecting their daily lives, big and small: streets, bins, schools and housing.There’s a crisis in local government but the only reform agenda to get any real attention – abolishing the council tax – has stalled. The danger of people feeling their elected officials have nothing to say to them has become clear, and local government should be central. Instead, it’s circling the drain.: Councils in Scotland ‘suffer the brunt’ of austerity cutsYemen Yemen’s bloody civil war has long since become a humanitarian catastrophe. Aid workers say the conflict has broken a taboo set by the - Ethiopian famine, whose images are etched in popular memory. There wasn’t supposed to be another catastrophe on that scale, when nearly half a million people died of hunger, shaming the wealthy countries of the world into action.But the pictures emerging from Yemen are as bad as  years ago. Save the Children believes , children died of hunger last year. UNICEF puts the death rate at  children a day – one every ten minutes.But while the famine in Ethiopia sparked a humanitarian response that became a cultural milestone, there’s no such reaction to the crisis in Yemen. Violence stops journalists from reporting and aid from being landed.A key player in the conflict is Saudi Arabia, which has been accused of numerous violations of international law in its air campaign on behalf of the Yemeni government, including a bomb attack that destroyed a school bus in August, killing  boys and dozens of adults. Despite calls for an arms embargo, the value of UK arms sales to Saudi Arabia actually grew by two thirds in , from £ million to \u2028£. billion.: Joyce McMillan: World is turning blind eye to its biggest catastropheDefenceHMS Queen Elizabeth has been in the news as much as Strictly Come Dancing over the past few weeks, from the arrival of the first F fighter aircraft on the aircraft carrier’s deck to dramatic pictures of its arrival in New York harbour, framed by the Manhattan skyline.The Ministry of Defence will be thrilled at media coverage that distracts from less welcome headlines. Serious problems in defence procurement and recruitment threaten to undermine the UK’s military capabilities.The National Audit Office revealed earlier this year that the black hole in the budget for new military kit could exceed £bn. And despite plans to shrink the army to , full-time troops, the outsourcing company hired to manage a recruitment drive hasn’t hit its target since . Army chiefs are now short by , soldiers, and Capita could be sacked from the contract.Meanwhile, even as the UK parades its new aircraft carriers and commits to a generation of shipbuilding work on the Clyde, it could still have fewer than  frigates and destroyers by the end of the next decade, raising questions about whether the Royal Navy can assemble a task force to protect Queen Elizabeth in hostile waters without the help of allies. The UK’s six new Type  destroyers are spending less and less time at sea due to manpower issues and expensive refits to correct engine faults.Again, the Ministry of Defence will point to good news on shipbuilding, with the export of the Type  frigate design – but the fact that Canada is buying  vessels and Australia nine merely underlines how stretched the Royal Navy, which will get just eight, really is.: Almost , Scottish MoD jobs have goneTaxationEarlier this month, it emerged that Facebook paid just £.m in UK corporation tax last year despite making record sales worth £.bn in this country. The social media giant slashed its British tax bill by declaring £m in “administrative expenses”, while reporting a global profit of £.bn.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔. Cheers.Is there going to be a remake of #Dad#s Army#  Only, a number of contributors seem to be vying for the part of Private Fraser: #Wur do-oO-MM-ED!# LOL 🙂# You stupid Boy, Pike##.sorry, John # lolI take your points Haydn and Ian, but according to predicted human population expansion, it is estimated the global population will be around  billion by the year  Other dynamics affecting population growth, as you know, is requiring more land not only for agriculture but for accommodation and expanded space for for other amenities related.Not doubt, I think, there may come a critical point where demand for the expansion of the population, not including technological advancement, will determine how we live and finding a balance between our own demands to this of the natural world and other le The driving force for this expansion is predominantly based on economics and technological advances, and as long as this is the precedent, this could bring into conflict what we want and what nature will will allow In the food chain, I suspect we will become more use to # processed food # as technological progress will find better ways of growing alternative foods, whether biologically or chemically, as an answer to keep a balance between our demands and this of a coexisting relationship with the natural laws which govern le itself, including humans.You are quite right John, there are people who seem to be dominating these columns and I fear that I am a guilty one —— as well as the others.Perhaps I should take a break and ease off.The trouble is, there are interesting and important problems out there which should be aired rather than be allowed to fester.Maybe a bit more humour would help to make the rough stuff a little more palatable.So, step forward anyone of a Dad’s Army disposition !! How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#. The advocates being the usual shetland suspects, utterly unqualied in scientic justication and reason, highly qualied in political posturing and self-interest. No, there is nothing here of humour. I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed. Just look how fearlessly he locked horns with the powerful vested interests south who were forever conspiring to keep Shetland in its box. Tavish has already clearly stated he is in favour of democratic reform of SCT, just notit requires him to stand up against anyone local.You`re right there Peter, the money hasn`t just gone it`s been squandered!Squandered or plundered John  Aren’t the controls on the access to Shetland’s charitable funds so weak that any dedicated self serving group with a plausible plan could arrange over time to help themselves  Viking by name#We’ve got to get away from the notion that the funds exist to secure Shetland’s economic future. They exist to ameliorate social disruption resulting from the oil era. Vast infrastructure projects in remote rural communities bring almost random redistributions in wealth and opportunity, drug dependency and a iety of other associated complex social issues and harms. Where is Shetland’s voluntary sector represented on SCT  It ain’t, and it runs scared of complaining.These unguarded funds have weakened and distracted local politics in Shetland. No one group is sufficiently powerful to say enough is enough. Where is the voice of those at the margins  Who speaks up for those in greatest need  The oil industry has washed it’s hands long since. The ongoing tolerance of this is pathetic..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Tuesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC.

They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media. RTÉ went further and extended the ban to all expressions of republican opinion, including popular ballads. As the peace process progressed the ban appeared more and more ludicrous, forcing the British government to abandon it in . Following the lting of the ban, Raymond McCartney became the first Sinn Féin representative to have his own voice heard in a  television interview. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1093314.jpg--.jpg?1539853794000\n","title":"is kilrea road sliding away","story":"Concerns have been raised about a section of the Kilrea Road where subsidence has caused the footpath to crack. TUV Councillor Timothy Gaston was contacted by local residents about the problem as they feared the footpath and road were not structurally safe.Councillor Gaston fears that the problem is now getting worse and is urging the Roads Department to act. Speaking to the , Councillor Gaston said: “I was contacted by local residents bout the footpath, and as the time has gone on, the problem has just got worse. “I got in contact with the Roads Department and they have been carrying out work to find the source of the problem.“The issue has now been flagged to the structural department from the maintenance department, and tests were carried out on the footpath and road just last week.” The heart of the problem lies with a tree that is growing through a wall at the edge of the footpath. However, there is also some natural subsidence that also needs to be addressed.Councillor Gaston wishes to give some reassurance to the public about the current safety of the footpath and boundary wall.He said: “The Department have said the wall is in no immediate danger of collapsing, but obviously there is a danger of this in the future, so I am eagerly and actively pushing that a solution be reached, before the problem gets any worse.” Many residents have expressed a fear thatthe situation persists, the road may have to be closed indefinitely, which is something Councillor Gaston is also keen to avoid. “There is a fear that part of the road might actually come away, so I am urging officials to act quickly to get a plan in place and be proactive about a solution so as work can be carried out in a controlled way, and the road will only have to be closed for necessary work, not indefinitely.”No plan for the road has been made to date, however officials are currently assessing the wall, footpath and road, and work on devising a plan is underway.

Frank’s story is one of a number which has been put together for the release of a tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends of Thomas and Gerard which is to be launched this weekend in Sailortown.Frank, who is now -years-old worked for Casey’s for over twenty years, recalls that day when fate determined who was in the yard that morning when the gunmen arrived.“My main job in Casey’s was to drive the old Bedford TK lorry, making deliveries to pubs, clubs and off licences. I always had one of the young lads on board as a helper,” explained Frank.“Every Wednesday for thirteen years I delivered to Casey’s off licences in Derry and Coleraine. They would ring in their orders on Monday. We would load up the old reliable Bedford on Tuesday and drive up to them on Wednesday morning.“On the day of the shooting that routine was changed which was fortunate for me and whoever was to go with me in the lorry that day. “The off licence in Derry, was due to be sold that Wednesday. If the sale went through, it meant that we would not be delivering to Derry, only Coleraine.It wasn’t until mid-afternoon that word came through that the sale went ahead. Frances Donnelly asked meI wanted to go on up to Coleraine that afternoon. As it was getting a bit late, I knew that we would not get back to the yard until after seven, so I told her that Thursday would be better. Frances gave me a choice that day and the choice that I made, saved my le.“On the Thursday morning we done a bit of tidying up around the yard and got ready to leave with the drink order.I didn’t know who was coming with me, it could have been any of the three lads, Thomas, another lad called Paul McDonald, and of course Gerard .“The owner, Sam Casey needed some pallets fixed, so that meant that Thomas was not going to go with me, because he was the best man for repairing pallets. That left two of lads to pick from, Paul and Gerard.“For some reason none of them wanted to go out that day and to settle matters Paul tossed a coin to see who had first choice, Gerard won the toss and he chose to stay in the yard. “It wasn’t really a big deal for Paul, he went into the store, got his jacket and that was us, we got into the lorry and left the yard, heading for Coleraine.”Frank and Paul headed off for Coleraine but little did they know what was to happen back in Belfast.“We found out later that we had only left the yard shortly before the gunmen arrived. For me, it was just another normal day. We were oblivious to the fact that while we were happily cruising along the motorway that gunmen had slaughtered our work colleagues and friends, back in Casey’s.“About an hour and a half after leaving Belfast I went into the off licence to speak to the manager. I took a phone call – ‘Frank, they are all dead’. I didn’t catch on what he meant, but it soon became clear and he asked who was with me. I told him that Paul was with me. “That confirmed to Vincent  that it was Thomas and Gerard who had been shot. Vincent was married to Marie, one of Sam Casey’s daughters, who worked in the upstairs office along with her sister Frances. Vincent happened to go in to the yard, unaware of what had happened, he saw one of his workers lying dead and when he went upstairs to the office he was met with an absolute blood bath. His we and her sister had been brutally murdered. “I drove back to Belfast in the lorry along with Paul, but I have absolutely no memory of the journey or the conversation between us, but I do remember going to the yard and getting the gates opened so I could drive the lorry in. “When I got into the yard there was blood everywhere, even on the fork lt. There was no one about, but I had no sooner got the lorry parked up, when newspaper reporters started to arrive outside, looking for interviews.“Thomas was seriously wounded and after treatment in hospital, was released after about two weeks. I know that Sam Casey was elated at the fact that Thomas had survived and was on the mend. Sam’s elation soon turned to deep sadness, Thomas died from his wounds exactly three weeks after he was shot.“The gunmen who went into the yard that day and shot my friends down like dogs have to bear the absolute responsibility, but fate played a role, as to who was in the yard when the murderers arrived.“The destiny of at least nine people was decided that day. The survival of the workers who would normally have been in the yard every single Thursday and the slaughter of those who happened to be there, was a matter of “s and buts” and for Gerard it was the outcome of a simple toss of a coin. “Yes, the outcome of the toss of a coin sealed Gerard’s fate, but saved the le of another worker. For Thomas, it was his skills at repairing wooden pallets that meant that he was working in the yard that morning.“I also think of the salesman who had been in the yard on business that morning and left just as we were driving out the gate. “Sam Casey, whose two daughters were murdered, would also have been in the yard that morning had he not have been in the Mater Hospital where he was recovering from a minor operation.”The tribute book will be launched this Sundayin the Mission to Seafarers Centre in Sailortown, soon after a plaque unveiling at pm at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new deacon gregory tells of his hopes for the job","story":"ONE of the nine men ordained as a Permanent Deacon at St Peter’s Cathedral last Sunday says he and others are “not afraid to see the pain” of parishioners as they begin their ministry across the city.Andersonstown man Gregory McGuigan QC spoke of how he will be beginning a new chaplaincy to the homeless after spending close to  years working with those on our streets at the Welcome Organisation and Morning Star hostel.“Technically I’m with St Brigid’s parish but I attend Clonard very regularly and masses for the homeless in the oratory in the Morning Star every Sunday,” he said. “For the past two years I’ve been doing my pastoral training in St Malachy’s close to the Markets in Alfred Street which is an absolutely fabulous place and reading and learning theology at St Mary’s University College,” he said.“The training to get to Sunday past has been a four year process.”Gregory explained how from a young age he had always been in involved “in service of some kind”.“From junior St Vincent de Paul, working with the homeless, I was one of the first ever volunteers at the Welcome Centre as it was known then in the grounds of St Peter’s. Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity. On the day Gerard was laid to rest, his friend Mitch decided to hop on the back of a lorry after the funeral which was heading back into town. As the lorry approached Millfield, Mitch lost his balance and fell from the lorry and was killed.The public are asked to assemble at St Joseph’s Church on Princes Dock Street on Sundayat pm."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast boat builder behind inspirational community currach honoured by theresa may","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last week he indicated that the decision was made on foot of consultations with the PSNI who were not in a position to provide security for him to travel by road. However, he has now said the Government jet, which costs €, an hour to operate, was called upon because of advice from his own officials. \"I have visited Northern Ireland many times in the last seven years and I take the advice from my office and my office judges these trips in terms of- the considerations they take into account are logistics and security,\" he said.The President was asked on three occasions to clary on what basis the jet was deemed necessary, but refused. \"No, Ive answered the question. I really dont ... quite frankly to say, now and in the future, I am very happy to accept the advice of my office, they balance the issue, their considerations are ones of logistic and security,\" Mr Higgins said. The President added that he is \"very happy with the official PSNI statement\" which said they could not comment on the security arrangements of iniduals. However, PSNI sources separately said there was anger at the suggestion that the force did not have sufficient resources to provide a police escort.Another source said: \"It would be inconceivable that the President of Ireland would not have been afforded securityit had been requested.\"Questions over the use of the jet are likely to feature in the final televised debate tonight. Businessman Gavin Duffy said extravagance \"seems to be embedded in the culture of Aras an Uachtarain\". He said controversies over the use of the jet and an unaudited €, fund for the Aras \"are starting to register with people\". But the Dragons Den investor admitted it would take something \"seismic\" to unseat Mr Higgins. Sinn Feins candidate Liadh Ni Riada has asked Mr Higgins to explain the \"huge public expense to fly within the island of Ireland, to places like Belfast and Kerry\". However, Joan Freeman appealed for candidates to move back to debating their vision for the presidency."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may set to brief cabinet on brexit negotiations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It would seem to be an act of utter folly to change the Prime Minister at this point,” he told Sky News during a visit to New York.Andrew Mitchell – an ally of former Brexit secretary David Davis who is seen as a possible leadership contender – also said a leadership challenge would be a “mistake”.“I think it is right to give the Prime Minister every support to conclude a deal,” he told BBC’s Newsnight.There is a danger tonight it seems to me that Parliament wont accept that deal or any other deal.

That will be a serious problem,” he said.There was further respite for Mrs May when the leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker announced he was withdrawing amendments to the Northern Ireland Bill designed to prevent the activation of the so-called Northern Ireland “backstop” – intended to ensure the border remains open after Brexit.The former Brexit minister – who quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan for leaving the EU – later welcomed her “strong assurance” in the House on maintaining the integrity of the UK.The Prime Minister told MPs she could not accept the EU’s original backstop plan as it would mean imposing controls on goods traded between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, creating “a customs border down the Irish Sea.”While she was ready to explore “every possible option” to break the impasse, she said a “critical” first step should be a legally-binding agreement on a temporary UK-EU joint customs territory to avoid the need for a Northern Ireland-only backstop.As an alternative,at the end of the transition at the end of  a deal on the UK’s future relationship with the EU was not quite ready, she said it might by preferable to prolong the transition.However, she stressed any such extension would have to be for a short time only and would have to be over “well before” the scheduled end of the current parliament in May ."},{"url":null,"title":"the latest hilarious viral meme involves a ladder made out of emojis","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A number of openings in the glasshouses were also repaired with broken panes replaced.Consultants have been appointed to conduct a series of studies at the forest park and in addition to the Arboretum and Annesley Garden, have been focusing on the parkrsquos bioersity and built heritage, traffic and car parking as part of the funding application process.Earlier this year, a study highlighted a wider entrance to the sprawling forest park and the development of an interpretative centre beside the Walled Garden.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.Initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Beaches among top with bathing water in Europe  ","story":"FOUR local beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it has been revealed.Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough are among a group of  beaches which have come top of the excellent water quality class, but it is a case of must do better for Newcastle beach where the water quality is labelled ldquosufficient.Tyrella and Murlough already hold the prestigious blue flag awards for the quality of their beaches with those who live along the Lecale coastline mdash who have been working to improve both Kilclief and Ballyhornan mdash delighted the beaches were identied for inspection for the first time, with the water quality included in the excellent category alongside beaches like Castlerock, Benone, Portballintrae and Portstewart.The districtrsquos beaches provide an excellent opportunity for people to get out and explore the arearsquos unique geological heritage and enjoy a wide range of activities which are available.Blue flag status assures visitors that the beaches have excellent water quality, are clean and that the environment is safe and accessible.The latest water quality figures published by the Department of the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsshow that the local beaches rank alongside some of the Provincersquos best, in particular, those along the North Coast and North Downrsquos so-called gold coast.A total of  bathing waters around the Provincersquos coastline have met strict European standards for quality, with  of these classied as excellent, which is the prerequisite for the coveted blue flag award.A further six beaches met the lsquogoodrsquo standards and the rest mdash including Newcastle mdash were placed in the lsquosufficientrsquo standard category alongside Crawfordsburn, Carnlough and Cloughey.David Small, head of DAERArsquos Environment, Marine and Fisheries Group, has welcomed the publication of the latest water quality results.He said: ldquoThis is a superb result for our beaches, especially given the changeable weather our coastline is often subject to. But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is imperative that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards.NI Water has also welcomed confirmation that all  beaches tested have met European standards for bathing water quality.Angela Halpenny, head of environmental regulation, said protecting the environment was an important part of NI Waterrsquos business.She said NI Water was delighted to hear that all  designated bathing waters have met European standards but warned against complacency, highlighting the need to push forward with further investment to ensure continued improvements are made.The beach water quality results were announced by the Better Beaches Forum whose members include DAERA, NI Water, coastal local authorities, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, the National Trust, Surfers Against Sewage and some coastal community groups.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke said he delighted that Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches have recognised as having excellent water, but expressed disappointment that Newcastle was only placed in the ldquosufficient standard, despite major investment by NI Water in the resortrsquos sewage treatment works.He said there was an onus on Newry Mourne and Down Council to work with its statutory partners to improve the water quality, suggesting this yearrsquos warm bathing season should have helped prevent pollutants from being flushed down rivers and out to sea.ldquoWe need to establish what were the reasons for Newcastlersquos water quality to have only secured a sufficient water quality standard, Cllr Clarke continued.ldquoThe tourism industry relies on its beaches and water quality and more needs to be done to ensure this is as good as it can and should be. High quality bathing waters and beaches are a critical factor in the enhancement of tourism, the economy and the environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bright’s Victor  is player of the year  ","story":"THE East Down Churches Table Tennis League held its annual presentation night, which had been postponed from last spring, in Frenchrsquos, Clough, on Friday evening.There was a good turnout of players from all clubs and friends of the league.

While our colour may have been an issue for some people, race has never been one for us or our families.ldquoWe did get some looks when we were together in South Africa, and maybe would still do when we are back, but itrsquos not something we take notice of.While the young couple viewed falling in love as natural, their love has helped to inspire others.Claire recalled: ldquoI remember Bongi and I were visiting his family home and we walked into the town one day hand in hand. An old black man approached us and held our hands and said, lsquoThis is what I call real freedomrsquo.Bongi, who works in engineering, says that Claire was more smitten with him at the beginning.However, Claire says that he told her he loved her as she as about to go to the airport tohome.ldquoWe kind of knew we were in love fairly quickly and decided to become boyfriend and girlfriend, even thought it was going to be a long-distance relationship, said Bongi.ldquoWe kept in touch by telephone. Because her call deal meant she couldnrsquot ring cell numbers, I would wait by a telephone box outside my house every day for her to call at pm.Eight months later, Claire ed to South Africa with her parents to meet Bongi and his family in his home town of Knysna.They were married over five years ago after decided that living in Northern Ireland was the best option as Claire had to finish university.Apart from appearing on the programme, the couple also were guests of Pamela Ballantine on UTV Le last Friday night.With this Ring is produced for UTV by Belfast-based independent company Triplevision Productions and is sponsored by Ellisonrsquos Jewellerrsquos, Belfast.

Therefore I appeal to those who have money to invest it in creating jobs for our youth.Dr Maguire said economists were painting ldquogloomy pictures of the economic system and were warning that levels of unemployment had become ldquoendemic.ldquoIn particular the level of youth unemployment is rising rapidly and it seems certain that growing numbers of our school leavers are destined to move directly to the dole queue, he stressed.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle receptionist Dolores Malone is the top hotel receptionist in Co Down and now she has the chance to prove that she is also the best in Northern Ireland when she takes place in the Coca-Cola Receptionist of the Year finals night in the Culloden Hotel next month.Dolores, receptionist at the Brook Cottage Hotel, won her way through to the finals by beating receptionists from hotels in Co Down and Co Armagh in the regional heat at the White Gables Hotel in Hillsborough.Dolores goes forward to compete for a pound holiday cheque, a specially engraved Tyrone Crystal vase and specially designed winnerrsquos badge and a framed certicate.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has won her fight to have a five year-old girl transported to school in Dundrum.The girl, who lives near Castlewellan, began her first year of education at Dundrum Primary School on Monday and special transport arrangements have been laid on for her.ldquoThe girl is now being lted by minibus at her front door each day and is also brought back home. This is very pleasing, Mrs Smyth said.A dispute over the provision of transport arose when the girlrsquos father demanded his daughter should be allowed to attended a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan.But according to Mrs Smyth the South Eastern Educationand Library Board said that the child would have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.Mrs Smyth, who took up the girlrsquos case, said this week: ldquoI am very glad that I was successful in this matter because it has clearly established the right of the parent.ARDGLASS mdash More than five thousand bales of hay and a wide range of farm equipment were destroyed in a blaze near Ardglass in the early hours of Sunday.Fire broke out in a large hay shed owned by Mr James Crangle, of Ardtole, and Downpatrick firemen spent more than eight hours containing it.Among the machinery which was destroyed were two tractors, a trailer, a threshing machine and several potato sorters.

When I learned later that I had Myasthenia, it all came as a bit of a shock at the time, said Barry.ldquoItrsquos a rather debilitating condition which there is no cure. Itrsquos an illness which stops the muscles working properly. In my case it manested itself from the onset of double vision which I had on and off for a full year which was very unpleasant.Double vision can either be vertical or horizontal and unfortunately Barryrsquos double vision was both.ldquoMyasthenia affects people in dferent ways, said Barry. ldquoIn my case, my eye muscles were particularly affected.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children. All this needs to stop and people want to see police doing more, he added.Jeanette McCarthy, chairwoman of the Tosuacute Uacuter residentsrsquo group which includes the Lynn Doyle area, revealed parents were afraid to let their children out to play in the evening.She added: ldquoThere is just no way we can let our children play around the parklands below the Cathedral. It is getting to the point where we have to go to Delamont outside Killyleagh with the kids to make sure they are okay and can play safely.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has organised tomorrowrsquos meeting, said the town centre issues were affecting the whole community.ldquoI have also been approached by residents in the Quoile Fold where senior citizens expressed concern that they are afraid to go out for milk in the evenings, he said.ldquoIt is my understanding that those involved in the anti-social behaviour are known to police so itldquoThe fact this trouble has been going on for months is wholly unacceptable.ldquoRepresentatives of residentsrsquo groups have been invited to attend tomorrowrsquos meeting to reflect how what is happening in the town centre is also spilling over into the areas where they live.Confirming the attendance of representatives from Downpatrick Youth Initiatives at tomorrowrsquos meeting, Cllr Enright said the organisation also wanted to ensure the young people it was responsible for could play safely in the town centre and surrounding area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8809291.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:LONDON, Sept.  and . \u2028There are private Letters in Town which are filled with Accounts of the gallant Behaviour of the Right Hon. the Earl of Crawford, a Voluntierin the Russian Army, commanded by Count Munich all these Letters mention his Lordship having sustained an important Part in every Action that Army was engaged in, but are so far from saying any thing of his Lordship’s being killed, as was reported, that they assure us, that he has had the good Fortune to escape unwounded.[A war was raging between Russia and the Turks. The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain. This is an early example of the record being corrected in a bid to convey accurate news]FRANCE. Paris Oct . Last week a very old Man, who had , Livres in ready Money by him, wished to see himself possess of , before he died, for which Purpose he prevailed upon his Son to borrow  Livres for him as soon as he got that Sum, he shut himself up in his Closet in order to join it to his own Stock but while he was busy in telling over his Money in his Chest, the Lid of it fell upon his Head, and he was found dead the next Day. The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December .

Michelle Williamson who lost her mother and father in the Shankill bombing. Photo: Presseye “My le is good, I enjoy le. I have certainly rediscovered my zest for just going out and having a good time.“For me I have been able to let go of the anger and let go of the pain of that day. I haven’t ever forgiven the people that carried out the bombing, obviously... They don’t come into my thinking at all.”A former butcher, he now works as centre manager for the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast, for survivors of the Troubles.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice. But after urging from close friends and my children, I said yes.It is now well underway and feed-back is great and I love it. I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast. Industry STR Global figures for June revealed that occupancy rates in Belfast were down by around % after , new rooms were added.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
