At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ...

Switzerland and Germany have been ided by the coronavirus pandemic. Fences, concrete obstacles or barrier tapes separate them after the borders were closed to slow the spread of the virus. But love cannot be locked away“Look, we even marked the border on our blanket,” laughs Sabrina. And indeed just below the barrier tape a black line ides the cloth in half. Lying on one half is Sabrina, from Basel on the other, Davor from Wiesbaden. We are in Riehen, the rich suburban community of Basel.It is the first time that the two of them have seen each other since the border was closed a good six weeks ago. The Covid-19 pandemic caused Switzerland and its surrounding countries to close their borders mid-March. Only people who work in another country and companies transporting goods are now allowed to cross the borders at the few crossings that are still open.It is a warm spring day. Riehen is famous for its cherry trees, thanks to the mild climate of the Rhine plain. And on these cherry trees, which are in blossom on both sides, the border guards have attached barrier tapes which now mark what is accessible. These tapes also trace the border lines which were reinforced with barbed wire during the second world war.For the people on both sides, these restrictions are a serious disturbance, as the border has hardly been noticed in recent decades. Friendships exist across borders, as do families and lovers.“Take pictures of us,” says Sabrina. “It’s good if this becomes known.” An untenable situation for her. Davor arrived today to see his girlfriend. It takes three and a half hours to drive from Wiesbaden, and he will return in the evening.Despite everything, the mood is good on this friendly day. Along the barrier tape several groups of people have arranged to meet: separated families, friends, other lovers. A group of young men has set up camping chairs on both sides of the barrier. All three are from Lörrach in Germany, the neighbouring community of Riehen. One of them is studying in Basel. This is the only place they can meet and drink beer together.The border stretches up the hill. A bit further up the edge of the forest, I meet Diethard (on the German side) and his girlfriend Sibel (on the Swiss side). Sibel, also a German citizen, works in a clinic in Switzerland: “If I were to officially go over to Germany, I would first have to be in quarantine for two weeks. That’s impossible.”Now and then an army helicopter flies along the unclear border, making sure the rules are obeyed on the ground. There soldiers reinforce the border guards. If a couple gets too close to each other on the border, the guards usually turn a blind eye.This is not the case everywhere. Further east on Lake Constance are Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) and its sister city of Constance (Germany). They have grown together completely. In some places, the fence erected by the Swiss during the second world war to prevent Jewish refugees or German opposition members from crossing the border still exists.Since the border is shorter and clearer here than at Basel, it was easier to close it again in the wake of the pandemic.Shortly after the closing of the border, I meet Katarina from Frauenfeld, in Switzerland, and Ivo, a student from Konstanz. Three times a week they meet at the border, also to exchange tenderness they met in Croatia only last New Year.Here, physical closeness was a thorn in the side of the Swiss law enforcement officers: a week later, when I saw the two of them again, kissing was no longer possible. A second fence was raised two metres away from the first, under strong protest from the local population. Now Katarina and Ivo can only look into each other’s eyes.But they still have it good: along the Italian and French borders, such meetings were always out of the question, because in Italy and France – unlike in Switzerland and Germany – strict curfews prevented this.With the flattening of the corona curve, demands are now being made to open the borders again. Not only families and couples want their normal relationship back, but also the trades that usually do good business on the other side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b67c5459a3bc372b342a9549e7bfdff11f4b4ec3/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=38c529323692c7cae008af180b5e0230 1440w","title":"its a gas gas gas remnants of our industrial past in pictures","story":"Over the past five years, Brighton-based photographer Richard Chivers has been shooting gas holders from London to Sunderland.for his project OFF-Grid, after learning that National Grid planned to demolish the structures. “They hold a certain nostalgia to our industrial heritage,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20fa19530579962ff5de1ad053ad8221d84820f7/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=937883497bb8dcfa3b014b5120cc3fc1 700w","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The total number of confirmed cases stands at 4,102,955, while the global death toll has reached 282,719, according to Johns Hopkins University.

That cynical image of humanity has been proclaimed in films and novels, history books and scientific research. But in the last 20 years, something extraordinary has happened. Scientists from all over the world have switched to a more hopeful view of mankind. This development is still so young that researchers in different fields often don’t even know about each other.When I started writing a book about this more hopeful view, I knew there was one story I would have to address. It takes place on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. A plane has just gone down. The only survivors are some British schoolboys, who can’t believe their good fortune. Nothing but beach, shells and water for miles. And better yet: no grownups.On the very first day, the boys institute a democracy of sorts. One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group’s leader. Athletic, charismatic and handsome, his game plan is simple: 1) Have fun. 2) Survive. 3) Make smoke signals for passing ships. Number one is a success. The others? Not so much. The boys are more interested in feasting and frolicking than in tending the fire. Before long, they have begun painting their faces. Casting off their clothes. And they develop overpowering urges – to pinch, to kick, to bite. By the time a British naval officer comes ashore, the island is a smouldering wasteland. Three of the children are dead. “I should have thought,” the officer says, “that a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” At this, Ralph bursts into tears. “Ralph wept for the end of innocence,” we read, and for “the darkness of man’s heart”.This story never happened. An English schoolmaster, William Golding, made up this story in 1951 – his novel Lord of the Flies would sell tens of millions of copies, be translated into more than 30 languages and hailed as one of the classics of the 20th century. In hindsight, the secret to the book’s success is clear. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind. Of course, he had the zeitgeist of the 1960s on his side, when a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of the second world war. Had Auschwitz been an anomaly, they wanted to know, or is there a Nazi hiding in each of us?I first read Lord of the Flies as a teenager. I remember feeling disillusioned afterwards, but not for a second did I think to doubt Golding’s view of human nature. That didn’t happen until years later when I began delving into the author’s life. I learned what an unhappy inidual he had been: an alcoholic, prone to depression a man who beat his kids. “I have always understood the Nazis,” Golding confessed, “because I am of that sort by nature.” And it was “partly out of that sad self-knowledge” that he wrote Lord of the Flies.I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life Lord of the Flies. After trawling the web for a while, I came across an obscure blog that told an arresting story: “One day, in 1977, six boys set out from Tonga on a fishing trip ... Caught in a huge storm, the boys were shipwrecked on a deserted island. What do they do, this little tribe? They made a pact never to quarrel.”The article did not provide any sources. But sometimes all it takes is a stroke of luck. Sifting through a newspaper archive one day, I typed a year incorrectly and there it was. The reference to 1977 turned out to have been a typo. In the 6 October 1966 edition of Australian newspaper The Age, a headline jumped out at me: “Sunday showing for Tongan castaways”. The story concerned six boys who had been found three weeks earlier on a rocky islet south of Tonga, an island group in the Pacific Ocean. The boys had been rescued by an Australian sea captain after being marooned on the island of ‘Ata for more than a year. According to the article, the captain had even got a television station to film a re-enactment of the boys’ adventure.I was bursting with questions. Were the boys still alive? And could I find the television footage? Most importantly, though, I had a lead: the captain’s name was Peter Warner. When I searched for him, I had another stroke of luck. In a recent issue of a tiny local paper from Mackay, Australia, I came across the headline: “Mates share 50-year bond”. Printed alongside was a small photograph of two men, smiling, one with his arm slung around the other. The article began: “Deep in a banana plantation at Tullera, near Lismore, sit an unlikely pair of mates ... The elder is 83 years old, the son of a wealthy industrialist. The younger, 67, was, literally, a child of nature.” Their names? Peter Warner and Mano Totau. And where had they met? On a deserted island.My wife Maartje and I rented a car in Brisbane and some three hours later arrived at our destination, a spot in the middle of nowhere that stumped Google Maps. Yet there he was, sitting out in front of a low-slung house off the dirt road: the man who rescued six lost boys 50 years ago, Captain Peter Warner.Peter was the youngest son of Arthur Warner, once one of the richest and most powerful men in Australia. Back in the 1930s, Arthur ruled over a vast empire called Electronic Industries, which dominated the country’s radio market at the time. Peter was groomed to follow in his father’s footsteps. Instead, at the age of 17, he ran away to sea in search of adventure and spent the next few years sailing from Hong Kong to Stockholm, Shanghai to St Petersburg. When he finally returned five years later, the prodigal son proudly presented his father with a Swedish captain’s certificate. Unimpressed, Warner Sr demanded his son learn a useful profession. “What’s easiest?” Peter asked. “Accountancy,” Arthur lied.Peter went to work for his father’s company, yet the sea still beckoned, and whenever he could he went to Tasmania, where he kept his own fishing fleet. It was this that brought him to Tonga in the winter of 1966. On the way home he took a little detour and that’s when he saw it: a minuscule island in the azure sea, ‘Ata. The island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in 1863, when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives. Since then, ‘Ata had been deserted – cursed and forgotten.But Peter noticed something odd. Peering through his binoculars, he saw burned patches on the green cliffs. “In the tropics it’s unusual for fires to start spontaneously,” he told us, a half century later. Then he saw a boy. Naked. Hair down to his shoulders. This wild creature leaped from the cliffside and plunged into the water. Suddenly more boys followed, screaming at the top of their lungs. It didn’t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. “My name is Stephen,” he cried in perfect English. “There are six of us and we reckon we’ve been here 15 months.”The boys, once aboard, claimed they were students at a boarding school in Nuku‘alofa, the Tongan capital. Sick of school meals, they had decided to take a fishing boat out one day, only to get caught in a storm. Likely story, Peter thought. Using his two-way radio, he called in to Nuku‘alofa. “I’ve got six kids here,” he told the operator. “Stand by,” came the response. Twenty minutes ticked by. (As Peter tells this part of the story, he gets a little misty-eyed.) Finally, a very tearful operator came on the radio, and said: “You found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it’s them, this is a miracle!”In the months that followed I tried to reconstruct as precisely as possible what had happened on ‘Ata. Peter’s memory turned out to be excellent. Even at the age of 90, everything he recounted was consistent with my foremost other source, Mano, 15 years old at the time and now pushing 70, who lived just a few hours’ drive from him. The real Lord of the Flies, Mano told us, began in June 1965. The protagonists were six boys – Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano – all pupils at a strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku‘alofa. The oldest was 16, the youngest 13, and they had one main thing in common: they were bored witless. So they came up with a plan to escape: to Fiji, some 500 miles away, or even all the way to New Zealand. There was only one obstacle. None of them owned a boat, so they decided to “borrow” one from Mr Taniela Uhila, a fisherman they all disliked. The boys took little time to prepare for the voyage. Two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner were all the supplies they packed. It didn’t occur to any of them to bring a map, let alone a compass.No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads. It was dark. They hoisted the sail, which the wind promptly tore to shreds. Next to break was the rudder. “We drifted for eight days,” Mano told me. “Without food. Without water.” The boys tried catching fish. They managed to collect some rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells and shared it equally between them, each taking a sip in the morning and another in the evening. Then, on the eighth day, they spied a miracle on the horizon. A small island, to be precise. Not a tropical paradise with waving palm trees and sandy beaches, but a hulking mass of rock, jutting up more than a thousand feet out of the ocean. These days, ‘Ata is considered uninhabitable. But “by the time we arrived,” Captain Warner wrote in his memoirs, “the boys had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination.” While the boys in Lord of the Flies come to blows over the fire, those in this real-life version tended their flame so it never went out, for more than a year.The kids agreed to work in teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and guard duty. Sometimes they quarrelled, but whenever that happened they solved it by imposing a time-out. Their days began and ended with song and prayer. Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat – an instrument Peter has kept all these years – and played it to help lift their spirits. And their spirits needed lifting. All summer long it hardly rained, driving the boys frantic with thirst. They tried constructing a raft in order to leave the island, but it fell apart in the crashing surf. Worst of all, Stephen slipped one day, fell off a cliff and broke his leg. The other boys picked their way down after him and then helped him back up to the top. They set his leg using sticks and leaves. “Don’t worry,” Sione joked. “We’ll do your work, while you lie there like King Taufa‘ahau Tupou himself!”They survived initially on fish, coconuts, tame birds (they drank the blood as well as eating the meat) seabird eggs were sucked dry. Later, when they got to the top of the island, they found an ancient volcanic crater, where people had lived a century before. There the boys discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens (which had been reproducing for the 100 years since the last Tongans had left). They were finally rescued on Sunday 11 September 1966. The local physician later expressed astonishment at their muscled physiques and Stephen’s perfectly healed leg. But this wasn’t the end of the boys’ little adventure, because, when they arrived back in Nuku‘alofa police boarded Peter’s boat, arrested the boys and threw them in jail. Mr Taniela Uhila, whose sailing boat the boys had “borrowed” 15 months earlier, was still furious, and he’d decided to press charges.Fortunately for the boys, Peter came up with a plan. It occurred to him that the story of their shipwreck was perfect Hollywood material. And being his father’s corporate accountant, Peter managed the company’s film rights and knew people in TV. So from Tonga, he called up the manager of Channel 7 in Sydney. “You can have the Australian rights,” he told them. “Give me the world rights.” Next, Peter paid Mr Uhila £150 for his old boat, and got the boys released on condition that they would cooperate with the movie. A few days later, a team from Channel 7 arrived. The mood when the boys returned to their families in Tonga was jubilant. Almost the entire island of Haʻafeva – population 900 – had turned out to welcome them home. Peter was proclaimed a national hero. Soon he received a message from King Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV himself, inviting the captain for an audience. “Thank you for rescuing six of my subjects,” His Royal Highness said. “Now, is there anything I can do for you?” The captain didn’t have to think long. “Yes! I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.” The king consented. Peter returned to Sydney, resigned from his father’s company and commissioned a new ship. Then he had the six boys brought over and granted them the thing that had started it all: an opportunity to see the world beyond Tonga. He hired them as the crew of his new fishing boat. While the boys of ‘Ata have been consigned to obscurity, Golding’s book is still widely read. Media historians even credit him as being the unwitting originator of one of the most popular entertainment genres on television today: reality TV. “I read and reread Lord of the Flies ,” ulged the creator of hit series Survivor in an interview.It’s time we told a different kind of story. The real Lord of the Flies is a tale of friendship and loyalty one that illustrates how much stronger we are if we can lean on each other. After my wife took Peter’s picture, he turned to a cabinet and rummaged around for a bit, then drew out a heavy stack of papers that he laid in my hands.

He also said e-scooter trials would be brought forward, and rental e-scooters could hit UK roads as early as June. Electric scooters – which can travel at up to 15.5mph – are currently banned on roads and pavements in the UK.Connor Campbell, analyst at trading platform Spreadex, says: Given the market’s utter lack of interest in the recent job losses in the US, it shouldn’t be a surprise that a purely positive view was taken of what was announced by Johnson in his faux-Churchillian manner on Sunday, allowing the FTSE to bound out of the gates.Let’s take another look at the stock markets.More people are choosing simpler funerals in coronavirus times, according to the funeral services firm Dignity. It says:But Dignity’s profits have fallen, as it conducted more simple funerals and stopped providing church services and limousines because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its underlying profits fell to £19.4m in the first quarter from £21.7m a year earlier.The firm adds that the number of deaths could fall back in the next couple of years: Should 2020 witness a large number of incremental deaths, beyond the 600,000 originally anticipated by the Office for National Statistics, then it is possible that 2021 and 2022 could experience a lower number of deaths than in 2019. The group will not speculate on the most likely outcome.Heathrow has called for the government to set out a plan to re-open borders, so airports and airlines can restart more flights, after Boris Johnson confirmed travellers will have to self-isolate upon arrival in the UK. It is not clear how long the quarantine will last or when it will be brought in, but airlines have been told that it will be a 14-day quarantine period. The London airport, the busiest in Europe in normal times, said in a statement that the quarantine plan would effectively close the UK’s borders, resulting in even lower passenger numbers than the 200,000 seen in April.The budget carrier easyJet urged the government to keep the quarantine only for a short period. A spokesperson says:Quarantine requirements for passengers should only be in place for a short period, while the UK remains in lockdown.Aviation and tourism bosses have already warned that the 14-day quarantine plan would be a “nightmare” for the travel industry.We are still waiting for more details on the lockdown easing in the UK. Boris Johnson’s television address was quickly condemned as isive and confusing from across the political spectrum.Meanwhile, there is a new cluster of coronavirus cases in Wuhan, prompting fears of a fresh wave of infections in China. And South Korea is battling to contain a fresh outbreak at night clubs and bars.You can read more on our coronavirus live news blog.Cafes and restaurants in the UK will start to reopen from July – but pubs were notably excluded from the plans to reopen some of the hospitality industry, fuelling worries that nearly half could be driven out of business. The UK’s “stay at home” slogan has changed to “stay alert”.In the UK, people will be allowed to spend unlimited time outdoors from Wednesday, and can drive to beauty spots across the country. Holiday resorts across the country are now cautiously preparing to open at the end of May.However, the wider travel industry will be hit by Johnson’s announcement of a quarantine period for (nearly) all people arriving in the UK by air (French passengers will be exempt, Downing Street later clarified). The Institute of Travel and Tourism warned that a lengthy quarantine would be a “nightmare” that would badly hurt a sector already in meltdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Investors have been cheered by news of more countries reopening their economies, shrugging off fears of a second wave of Covid-19 after a pickup in new infections in South Korea and Germany.In France, millions of people will emerge from the country’s lockdown today, when shops, hair salons, primary schools and nurseries reopen. New Zealand announced further relaxation measures: it will open malls, cafes, cinemas and gyms from Thursday, and schools from next Monday. Belgium and Greece will also ease their lockdowns today.In the UK, Boris Johnson presented the government’s plans for a gradual easing of the Covid-19 lockdown last night, which means primary schools in England will partially reopen from 1 June, along with some shops. Manufacturers and construction workers have been urged to return to work, and all others who cannot work from home (but they shouldn’t use public transport).We could see a bounce in the FTSE 100 index today, after UK markets were closed for VE Day last Friday. It is tipped to open 55 points higher. European markets are also expected to rise at the open, with Germany’s Dax being called more than 100 points higher.David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says:The shocking moves that were seen in global equity markets in February and March reflected the views that economies were to be severely hit by the Covid-19 crisis, but in recent weeks a number of countries have taken steps to reopen aspects of their economies and that progress has fuelled the bullish sentiment in equities. Yesterday, prime minister Johnson mapped out plans to loosen the UK’s lockdown restrictions. Workers in construction and manufacturing could potentially recommence work in the near term, so that is likely to boost investment confidence in London-listed stocks.Equity markets in Asia gained ground overnight on the back of optimism in relation to countries loosening their lockdown restrictions, and in turn European indices are tipped to open higher. South Korea and Germany reported an increase in new infections in the wake of their restrictions being eased. This is something that traders should be mindful of as it might curtail the reopening of other economies for fear of a second wave of cases.

No parades or night shows will run either.“Close interaction and close-up photos with characters will be suspended during the initial phase of reopening,” Shanghai Disney Resort said in a statement.Disney closed the Shanghai park on 24 January, before closing other theme parks across the world in March. However, the US entertainment company is eager to reopen facilities and try to make back lost revenues.The company was heavily exposed to the virus, which forced the cancellation of cruises and the closure of the cinemas playing its blockbuster films – although the timely launch of its new streaming service, Disney+, has cushioned some of the blow.The group also scrapped its idend, but it drew criticism from Bernie Sanders, the former US Democratic presidential candidate, and Abigail Disney, an heir to the Disney fortune, after it furloughed more than 100,000 employees to save money on salaries, despite retaining large rewards for its leaders.Bob Iger, who moved from chief executive to executive chairman in February, gave up his salary for 2020, but could still receive millions of dollars in performance related incentive payments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db0c519c089020b5c9b3f8dbaa0d1cbb0a033498/0_120_2512_1506/master/2512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aadfd2e32098ba233993f73c18f2e22","title":"my favourite film aged 12 indiana jones and the last crusade","story":"Nazi jousters on motorbikes, crash-landing biplanes, spooky catacombs and ancient riddles – my first encounter with Indy was a thrilling sensory overloadIt was 1994, and I was 12 years old. My dad had recently bought himself a Hi8 video camera and I requisitioned it to make my own movies. Given my sub-novice status, it seemed sensible to begin by copying my favourite films. I turned to my own library of movies for inspiration – all on VHS, mostly recorded from the TV.To me, VHS technology was incredible. I could watch a movie, press pause, study a shot, rewind, and figure out how to adapt it into my own living room, garden or driveway (the most readily available locations). My bedroom was converted into a makeshift special effects studio and my younger brothers and I choreographed daft stunts with flour-based pyrotechnics.These film-making adventures allowed me to relive my earliest and most formative memory of going to the cinema, where my movie-making obsession began. Even now, I still get goosebumps if I think back to that night in 1989 when I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade at the Empire, Leicester Square in London.I went with my best friend, who lived just up the road from me. His dad volunteered to take us – a detail made all the more exciting because he had worked on the movie in the special effects department. Before we all left, he took enormous pleasure in hurling a red brick at me and watching me crumple into a terrified heap. I opened my eyes, embarrassed, when I realised it was a polystyrene prop.We lived about an hour outside London, and the journey to the cinema was filled with anticipation and some screams of hysteria. (Looking back I now realise that my friend’s dad handled all of this with great patience). I had no preconception of who Indiana Jones was, or even what he did, but like a lot of kids my age I thought Han Solo was the coolest man on the planet, followed closely by James Bond. I was clearly the target audience because this film had both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.To experience Indy for the first time on a giant screen was utterly intoxicating. The film begins with a rip-roaring origin story set in 1912, in which a young Indy (played by River Phoenix) stumbles across a gang of grave robbers who discover a golden crucifix. Indy intervenes and a chase ensues. From there the pace never lets up.We go from seeing Indy galloping alongside a circus train (and having a brush with a bullwhip and a lion), to exploring spooky Venetian catacombs, solving ancient riddles and jousting Nazis on motorbikes. And, just when you think he could do with a lie down, he still has to crash-land a biplane, attack a tank while on horseback – and bump into Hitler. Finally, he finds himself in the mysterious Canyon of the Crescent Moon, and heads start to roll in a more literal sense. I came out of the cinema looking like a deer caught in the headlights. In the space of two hours I had seen more of the world than I ever knew existed.But the spectacle had overwhelmed my senses. I was too young to appreciate the dialogue (“You have chosen … wisely.”), or the chemistry between Ford and Connery. It wasn’t until I was 12 and had a copy of the film on VHS that I began to appreciate what it was really about.Ostensibly, The Last Crusade is a race to discover the Holy Grail before the Nazis do and prevent the forces of evil from “marching over the face of the Earth”, as Connery puts it. But, while that may be the film’s MacGuffin, what Steven Spielberg, the director, was really interested in is a story of fathers and sons, and, typically for him, a desire to heal a ided family. Indy’s leap of faith in the final act isn’t so much about religious belief as it is about restoring his relationship with his father. Some of these details only fully resonated 26 years later when I became a father myself.Unlike Henry Jones Sr, my dad wasn’t obsessed with discovering the “Cup of Christ”, but I could relate to Indy’s frequent and awkward attempts to connect with him. “Do you remember the last time we sat and had a drink together?” Indy asks as the pair try to escape Germany in a zeppelin. “I ordered a milkshake.” Henry retorts: “So, what do you want to talk about?” Indy doesn’t know. The scene felt familiar. Like most 12-year-old boys, I craved my father’s attention, and when I got it, the conversation usually steered toward something abstract, like science or religion. It was rarely about us.During a thrilling rescue in the mountains of Hatay, Indy finds himself on a tank as it veers off the edge of a giant ravine. Henry looks down across the canyon, assuming he has been killed. “I never told him anything. I just wasn’t ready. Five minutes would have been enough,” Henry laments. When Indy scrambles to safety along the cliff edge and rejoins them, his father grabs him in disbelief, exclaiming: “I thought I’d lost you, boy.” Indy is suddenly 12 again, and we see his boyish smile as he receives a rare warm embrace from his father.In a movie packed with breathtaking action, this brief moment of tenderness stayed with me. What I appreciate now, 26 years later, especially during lockdown, is that boys don’t just need rugged heroes who ride off into the sunset they also need hugs from their fathers, whatever age they might be.• Laurence Topham is the ’s video special projects editor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8a4876dbc89133a8e24d9ef98d5a0e828b4f792/0_481_4018_2411/master/4018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576adb428c14c69897353a7854d0ddfa","title":"project restart the four stances dividing premier league clubs","story":"For some clubs ‘the show must go on’ while others say ‘not under these conditions’ – we take a look at the differing approaches to a resumptionThe plain, public argument for resuming competition was made in a statement released after the last meeting of the Premier League’s 20 clubs. “The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019‑20 season,” it read, “maintaining integrity of the competition.”Sporting integrity matters in an abstract way, that it’s better to complete something properly than have it decided by committee. More tangibly, there is also an argument for playing on so that European qualification can be decided on the field. Finally, Liverpool may only be two games from the title but it would surely be preferable for them to win their first championship in 30 years on the pitch.But really, it’s about the money. According to a letter sent last month by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, to the select committee of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the top flight faces “a £1bn loss, at least, if we fail to complete season 2019-20”.As the main beneficiaries of the league’s lucrative broadcast deals, the competition’s biggest clubs stand to lose the most, perhaps as much as £100m each once failed sponsorship and absent matchday revenue is factored in.Even for some of the biggest clubs in the world, these sums are stark and the losses may not be sustainable. It’s these concerns that are driving any return to play, even if they are not being aired publicly by the clubs.Last week the Crystal Palace chairman, Steve Parish, made a new, more nuanced case for resumption.Provided those safeguards were in place, and he believed they could be, Parish argued that football should play on, because waiting may not make things any better.This was the positive case for resumption and one that may appeal to a number of clubs with less at stake than those at the top or bottom. An argument sides such as Burnley and Sheffield United, who have declared their enthusiasm for resumption in the right conditions, could perhaps fall behind.A week later, however, Parish had refined his position. “We would be derelict in our duty if we didn’t find a way to try to bring the game back,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, but “it may prove beyond us. We have huge challenges in order to ... complete this season”.The Palace chairman was basically making the same argument but it sounded very different. In crossing the fine line between enthusiasm and caution in this debate it echoed the words of Chelsea’s Frank Lampard. “We’re all working in the same direction that we want it back,” he said this month, “but … we cannot risk the health of players and staff that are working in football – we can’t.”Effectively the majority of the clubs in the ision want the Premier League to restart if it can be made safe. The problem is that the virus will dictate when that is possible.There are a group of clubs who are actively against restarting the competition as planned. Project Restart involves lots of challenges for securing medical safety but also requires that the 92 remaining matches are played at neutral grounds.For some clubs, not by coincidence those at the bottom of the ision, this attacks the very integrity that the resumption of play is supposed to protect.How can it be fair for clubs to lose their home advantage at such a crucial stage of the season, they argue? The chief executive of Watford, Scott Duxbury, called it a “distorted nine-game mini league”.Other clubs, speaking anonymously, have called such opinions sabotage, or an attempt to stonewall progress until it is too late to resume play.According to Uefa, leagues must decide by 25 May if they are to resume. The clock is ticking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec2ff358dac73bc37d329ac50e810a897ae12f4d/0_0_4060_2437/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=714b8b2328856d08d24ae114c2911878","title":"remembering euro 96 gazzas goal three lions and penalties england","story":"ITV is replaying Euro 96 in full, allowing us to bask in the summer of Cool Britannia all over again but was it that good?The decision of ITV to replay Euro 96 in full, starting on Monday, is fraught with risk. They say you should never meet your heroes, and the same might apply to legendary sporting events. In this case even those who lived through it first time round and remember it as the very best of times may find, on getting to know it properly and soberly, that the reality does not live up to the myth.Somehow that summer has come to be seen as the pinnacle of Cool Britannia despite the fact that, other than the Spice Girls and the greatest singalong sporting anthem of all time (probably), the only British chart-topper was Gary Barlow. Sometimes it seems a considerable amount of gloss has been applied to our mental snapshots of that tournament. As Wayne Rooney once said, asked about that year’s England team: “It’s as if they won the tournament, the way they’re remembered.”Attendances were often poor and not only for the less enticing group games – there were more than 10,000 empty seats at Villa Park for the quarter-final between the Czech Republic and Portugal and a similar number at Old Trafford for the semi-final between the Czechs and France. As for the football, Euro 96 was the first 16-team European Championship and featured 64 goals the next four, before the tournament increased in size again to 24 teams in 2016, averaged 79. Across the quarter- and semi-finals a total of six goals were scored at the rate of one every 110 minutes (excluding stoppage time).And yet, at times there was something in the air, a magical combination of hope, pride and unabashed communal singing that grew in force as England progressed to the semi-finals. But that the hosts would be at all successful that summer was far from obvious when the competition kicked off.Having not had to qualify, their last competitive fixture had been the World Cup qualifier against San Marino in November 1993 that started with Davide Gualtieri putting the home side ahead after eight seconds and ended Graham Taylor’s inglorious spell in charge. Friendly results under Terry Venables had been mixed at best and their first-choice striker, the 25-year-old Alan Shearer, had scored only five international goals, the most recent 12 games and very nearly two years earlier.Then they went on a warm-up tour to Shanghai and Hong Kong, home of China Jump and its infamous tequila-consuming contraption, the dentist’s chair. Pictures of the team’s enthusiastic celebration of Paul Gascoigne’s 29th birthday scarred the tabloids on the weekend before the big kick-off. Back in Europe, Switzerland – England’s first opponents – read the papers with interest.“A week before the game they were having a great time in Hong Kong, and we thought maybe they’ll be recovering from the hangover, so maybe it would be an opportunity for us to win against these guys,” Ramon Vega, their centre-back, says. “We were preparing that week, thinking we might have a good chance because they’ll underestimate us, a small Swiss team, and the way they were acting showed that.”Les Ferdinand, who had just been crowned the PFA player of the year but was destined not to play a single minute at the tournament, was one of the players involved at China Jump. “Back then we had a big drinking culture in our football,” he says. “We’d come out of a long season and were going into a big tournament and it was the one night we were allowed to go out. We weren’t disrespecting anyone we were playing against, it was just young lads letting their hair down.”The resultant furore, while unpleasant, was not entirely unhelpful. “It really brought us together,” Ferdinand says. “There was always a feeling with England that whenever we got to a major competition the media always seemed to be against us, for one reason or another. It just galvanised us all together and it was almost like a siege mentality – it wasn’t us against the rest of Europe but everyone.”And so to kick-off, and an unconvincing start. Shearer put England ahead midway through the first half but the home side were far from dominant. Switzerland hit the bar before equalising from the penalty spot after a Stuart Pearce handball in the second half. “As the game went on, we started to gain a lot of confidence,” Vega says. “Going into the second half we were thinking, these guys aren’t great, no way whatsoever.”The game ended in a draw, and a few England players chose to wind down at Faces, a nightclub in Ilford, Essex, leading to more photographs and tabloid headlines, and a deepening of that siege mentality. “We just don’t understand that it’s necessary to do what you’re doing,” Venables told the media. “There are a few that seem like traitors to us. They’re turning the public against the players. If there’s an advantage to being at home, we aren’t taking advantage of it, are we? The support isn’t as strong as we should have. Therefore the advantage, if there was one, is disappearing.”It was during their second game, against Scotland, that England’s tournament ignited – though it took a while. “England were big favourites but I remember as the half-time whistle went there were a few little boos from the Wembley faithful, who expected them to roll us over,” says the Scotland midfielder Stuart McCall.After a goalless first half Venables brought on Jamie Redknapp, a midfielder, for the defender Pearce, a tactical switch that changed the game. “Just as we’re coming out after half-time there’s talk of Redknapp coming on, and everyone’s scurrying around trying to work out who was coming off and what the change of shape was,” McCall says. “We didn’t sort it out quick enough.”Eight minutes later Shearer headed in Gary Neville’s cross. Scotland regrouped and recovered, and had missed a couple of half-chances before McCall got the ball on the right wing and played it infield to Gordon Durie. Tony Adams ed in to dispossess him but caught the striker’s legs. England had conceded another penalty but this time – helped perhaps by the ball rocking gently on its spot as Gary McAllister ran up to strike it, for which Uri Geller promptly took credit – David Seaman made the save.McAllister has said “there’s no doubt in my mind that, if I had scored, we would have won”. One minute and two seconds after his shot deflected to safety off Seaman’s left elbow England doubled their lead, Paul Gascoigne looping the ball over Colin Hendry’s head before volleying past Andy Goram.“Pelé at his best would not have bettered that movement and finish,” Venables wrote. “It was a goal of unimpeachable quality, world-class, extraordinary, a wonder to behold. I could feel the crowd responding to what they were watching. I wanted a feast of football and I think it was at that moment I thought we could possibly provide it.”In their next game, against the Netherlands, England served up an all-you-can-eat buffet. Again Shearer opened the scoring and three more goals came in 11 second-half minutes. “We were playing a team you would expect to dominate possession but it was as though England became foreigners for a night,” Gary Neville wrote. The Dutch, among the tournament favourites, packed with members of the Ajax team who had won the Champions League a year earlier, were routed.With England 4-0 up and Scotland leading the Swiss 1-0 at Villa Park, the Scots were through on goal difference – until Patrick Kluivert clawed one back at Wembley. As Craig Burley put it: “At one point Craig Brown is shouting to me: ‘Get up, get up, we need a goal.’ Then two minutes later he’s screaming: ‘Go back, go back.’ Then five minutes later it’s: ‘Get up, get up.’ I didn’t know what the fuck was going on.”Once again for Scotland the journey ended in the group stage. “We actually came back with quite a few plaudits because we’d come that close but as a player it’s always harder when you get so near,” McCall says. “I was gutted not to continue. It was the same old Scotland – the number of times we’ve found different ways not to qualify.”England’s quarter-final opponents were Spain, who had snuck through their group thanks to Guillermo Amor’s late goal against Romania in their final game. The Spaniards had the better of the encounter and England needed a couple of penalty decisions, several Seaman saves and a pair of offside calls – one of which, to disallow Julio Salinas’s 33rd-minute strike, was particularly charitable – to go their way to make it as far as a penalty shootout.“The England game was the only game I didn’t play in you sit and watch it on the bench with a feeling of powerlessness,” says the midfielder José Emilio Amavisca. “It always looks easier from the outside and you sit there thinking you could help. The feeling at the end was so bitter because it was our best game at the Euros. We were quite a lot better than England and we deserved to go through but in that era we kept being struck by the curse of the quarter-finals and we didn’t have that luck.”Before the shootout started Javier Clemente, the Spain manager, considered who should take his side’s penalties. “I never prepared a list in advance,” he said. “For me, all 11 players on the pitch are capable of taking a penalty. Against England, I approached the first player I had in mind but he said no. I went to the second and he was happy to take one but the third also said no. What can you do in these moments? Nothing.” Fernando Hierro hit the bar, Miguel Ángel Nadal’s effort was saved and Stuart Pearce’s fist-pumping celebration after exorcising the ghosts of 1990 became one of the images of the tournament.“Everything that could go wrong went wrong against England,” Salinas said. “I had a perfectly good goal disallowed and once again we go out on fucking penalties, with everyone singing ‘Football’s Coming Home’, which I’ll never be able to get out of my head.”England’s semi-final followed precisely the opposite course. This time the hosts clicked, created but could not convert their chances: Shearer headed just past the post, Stefan Reuter cleared off the line, Darren Anderton hit the post from six yards, Gascoigne failed to reach the ball as it rolled along the goalmouth. It was 1-1 after 90 minutes, the same half an hour later, and Gareth Southgate missed England’s sixth penalty while Germany’s were perfection.“When Gareth missed, it felt a bit like death must do,” Venables said. “It was the lowest point of my career. That was my chance to win a trophy for my country in front of our supporters.”And so Venables’s footballing feast was over, its ending – in the words of the England manager – “like getting ready to sit down at a wonderful banquet when somebody takes the chair away from under you”.The night ended with riot police dealing with a drunken, bereaved mob in Trafalgar Square the tournament with another Germany victory, 2-1 against the Czechs thanks to Oliver Bierhoff’s golden goal, five minutes into extra time. The victors landed in Frankfurt the following day and sang Three Lions on a balcony in the town square as supporters thronged below them when they won the World Cup in 2014 fans in Berlin spontaneously broke into the same song. As Jürgen Klinsmann, Germany’s captain in 1996, has said: “We took the trophy and the song.”Magical as England’s performance against the Netherlands had been, and as well as they played against Germany, perhaps more than the sport it was its soundtrack that made the summer.“The drive to Wembley was frightening,” Anderton said of semi-final day. “As we got nearer the stadium, Alan Shearer put on Football’s Coming Home to get the boys pumped up and ready. Once we got to the stadium, it felt like there was already 100,000 people there. I remember staying out for the warm-up probably longer than we should have done, with Baddiel and Skinner on repeat. It really did get us going.”It was not only England and Germany who felt its effect. “We were singing it sometimes on the bus, especially after the game against England, where we surprised a lot of people,” Vega says. “We were very excited, we were singing in the dressing room: ‘It’s coming home’ – and then on the way to the hotel. As a team we were very satisfied and we were singing the song.”Santiago Cañizares, the Spain goalkeeper, says: “The soundtrack to the tournament was part of its history. I have nice memories of those Euros – the football was good, there were a lot of teams that could have won it. But Three Lions was part of what made it an enjoyable, memorable Euros.

A total of 187 residents have tested positive for the virus, the most recent on 22 April, but all have now recovered, there have been few hospital admissions and no deaths. “As a nation, we have achieved what few other countries have managed to do,” said the prime minister, Bardur a Steig Nielsen, in a statement. “As a society we should be grateful and proud of what we have accomplished. We will soon be able to get back to normal daily life as much as we can under these abnormal circumstances.” Measures to control the spread of the virus, officially described not as a lockdown but a “slow down”, were instigated on 12 March and plans for their easing, including the weekend’s return of sport “under controlled conditions”, announced on 9 April.In Torshavn last October KI secured a 3-0 away victory to win the championship. The tables were turned on Saturday as Torshavn won 2-0 in Klaksvik. There was nobody present to cheer their success, but the players forgot all about physical distancing when Sebastian Pingel’s header broke the deadlock with eight minutes to play, hugginglike they did in the days before coronavirus. Meinhard Olsen added a second in the last minute.“It was weird. I didn’t know where to run. First I set off towards the corner flag but suddenly I remembered that there are no fans so I just roared as loud as I could,” said Pingel, whose father Frank Pingel played for Newcastle in the 1988-89 season.KI are the best-supported team in the Faroe Islands and regularly draw crowds of thousands. “I just tried to concentrate on the game and encourage my teammates like in any other big game. But the difference is massive,” said their captain, Joannes Bjartalid. “We missed our supporters today. They usually give us an edge and I hope they can come back soon.”The silence changed the match in several ways, particularly when KI’s Deni Pavlovic was struck in the face by Michal Przybylski’s elbow and those present heard the contact, and the felled player groaning on the ground. Every word shouted by KI’s and Torshavn’s respective coaches, Mikkjal Thomassen and Jakup a Borg, was audible, too. “Of course you can hear the coaches loud and clear but as the match progresses you are in the zone and just playing the game. You forget about the surroundings,” said Bjartalíð.In a strong breeze and with temperatures hovering around freezing the Betri Deildin, as the Faroese league is known, had officially begun in Runavik two hours earlier when NSI Runavik’s game against the nation’s oldest club, TB Tvoroyri, kicked off. After eight minutes NSI’s Aron Knudsen became the first post-shutdown goalscorer in European football, and his side won 3-1. Knudsen’s father, Jens Martin Knudsen, was the famous bobble hat-wearing goalkeeper who was playing when the Faroe Islands shocked Austria and the world in 1990 by winning their first official competitive fixture 1-0.Even in the top flight most teams use outdoor pitches, the lack of walls presenting some difficulties when it comes to the idea of playing behind closed doors. “We like to call it playing without spectators as there are no doors to close,” says Virgar Hvidbro, general secretary of the Football Association.There had been some concern that fans might gather outside KI’s stadium or in the houses overlooking the ground, but very few defied the advice to stay away. “The locals have accepted the rules and discouraged people to gather around the ground,” said KI’s chairman, Tummas Lervig.Instead supporters followed the matches on radio, television and online. A bonus of being the first league to restart has been new interest from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, who all broadcast Saturday’s games live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e06b51429a66ca514214df0e2f8504b7310635a/0_0_8525_5115/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6c1abce408cf069503c50ec1a7f413","title":"no posh bread no fancy cheese and certainly no mayo the seven unwritten rules of eating baked beans","story":"From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beansForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones.

Ingredient swaps – sugar, flour, yeast – took place on doorsteps. The camaraderie confirmed what Maria, who has lived on this street for 15 years, has always known. Her “charmed” corner of Stoke Newington, with its Turkish grocers and independent shops, is “a great place to live”.Staying inside the terraced house she shares with her three children and husband Matthew Morgan, a writer, was no hardship either. The Argentinian-born designer, who has a background in theatre, has a knack for expressive but practical interiors. Her Victorian home is a case in point. By knocking down walls and layering colour with pattern, texture and art, she’s turned the five-bedroom house into a place to work, relax and socialise.Downstairs in the open-plan reception rooms, deep shelving houses a well-stocked bar and there’s enough space for the children to make dens. French doors open on to a garden large enough for games. With the advent of lockdown, the home office became a home school strewn with textbooks and art paraphernalia. “We haven’t got round to making soda bread or pasta like everyone else on social media. But I’ve realised that we have almost everything we need under one roof.”Her previous home was a maisonette a few doors down. “When I moved in I was newly single and feeling sorry for myself. All my neighbours prophesied that I would get pregnant. ‘Everyone gets pregnant in that flat,’ they told me.” It was a local myth which proved to be true. Within months she met Matthew.“When I was expecting our first child we decided to move to a bigger home. We’d set our sights on this house, but it was too expensive.” Then came the crash of 2008. “We were walking past when the owner appeared. We asked if he was still selling. He said yes and invited us in. We fixed a price there and then.”The previous owner had altered the house, adding the extension at the back and converting the attic. “But most of the work had been badly done so we had lots to do,” she says. “Many design crimes had been committed.”Among these was the laminate flooring downstairs. It was ripped up to reveal original floorboards that were then stripped and limewashed. Upstairs, partition walls were removed to open up the poky bathroom, where cascading house plants and bright encaustic tiles remind Maria of her childhood in rural Argentina. Some original features, such as the stained glass and the marble fireplace were intact, but most of the plasterwork had been ripped out. Luckily, she was able to rescue sections of original mouldings from a neighbour who was refurbishing their own property. She used these to recast the 19th-century cornices and ceiling roses.Before landing her first job in interiors with London designer Kate Guinness, Maria worked as a theatrical costume designer at venues such as the Barbican. She also attended London’s influential Motley Theatre Design Course, whose alumni include Olivier-award-winning Es Devlin.“I draw on my theatrical training for homes. A costume has to express its wearer, and it’s the same for interiors. There’s no right or wrong taste it’s about finding the colours and objects which make you feel happy. It’s a form of therapy.”Working in theatre has also made her resourceful. She did most of the decorating herself, experimenting with colours – “like a teenager trying out new hair dyes” – that suit her optimistic disposition. “My clients’ homes have to be perfect, but I’m not afraid of trying out new colours here.”Although every room is different – fern green in the living room, a whisper of pink in the bedroom – the effect is the same. “I chose cheerful but calm colours. Muted or neutral tones don’t reassure me. Strong contrasts are where I feel comfortable.”The floors are strewn with colourful woollen frazada rugs from Argentina. Art by family and locals, like Rob Ryan, sit next to beachcombed shells and stones under glass domes. “Anything is a treasure in this house.”Most of the antiques – the Murano chandeliers, the 1960s resin side table – were found locally. For curtains and cushions, she used bold botanical prints by 20th-century Swedish designer Svenskt Tenn, who she’s admired since childhood when her mother gave her a fabric sample.Before lockdown, a neighbour popped over to use the kitchen as a colourful backdrop for a teaching video. The floral wallpaper (also by Svenskt Tenn) is a recent addition – “It makes us smile” – and matches the extendable antique French table that she painted blue. Maria loved the solid wood kitchen units (by deVOL) so much that she travelled to Leicester to buy them after spotting the designs in a magazine 10 years ago. They are freestanding and one day they will travel with the family to their next home.She’s not sure where that will be, but you suspect it won’t be far away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96d6001a5876d7b0f6c1b8749047bcc3a84e63e0/0_429_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ac2d6909781c2960975bf52223cf1c6","title":"musicians music industry lockdown streaming spotify coronavirus","story":"Two new campaigns call for artists to receive greater cut of Spotify and streaming royaltiesTwo organisations that represent thousands of British musicians and songwriters will today launch a Keep Music Alive campaign calling for urgent changes to the music industry to protect artists at risk of ruin as a result of the coronavirus crisis.The campaign calls for solutions to the problems that the lockdown has inflicted on musicians. The suspension of live music under lockdown has cut off most artists’ one dependable source of income: gigs. And payments from streaming services such as Spotify are so negligible that they cannot hope to fill the massive hole in artists’ incomes.The campaign has been organised by the 30,000-strong Musicians’ Union and The Ivors Academy, named after the iconic Welsh composer and actor Ivor Novello and based around a community of songwriters and composers. Together, they are trying to alert tech platforms, record companies, politicians and listeners to the worsening predicament of those who make music.Keep Music Alive’s launch statement makes the basic point clear: “This crisis has brought into sharp relief the fact that creators and performers are sustained primarily by the live side of the music business and that streaming royalties are woefully insufficient.”An online campaign titled Broken Record is also taking shape. It has been co-created by Tom Gray of the Mercury prize-winning band Gomez, who is also a director of the Performing Rights Society, the body that sees to musicians’ payment from such sources as radio stations and the music played in pubs and hotels.On Sunday 24 May, Broken Record will host an evening of the hugely popular Twitter listening parties run by Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, which will feature such names as Boy George, the cult US band the Shins, and the critically acclaimed singer-songwriter John Grant.“Covid-19 happened and I was sitting there just thinking, ‘Live music has gone, and it’s going to be gone for a long time,’” says Gray.“A big chunk of musicians’ money comes from hairdressers and bars and cafes that pay for music licences, but that’s now going to take a big hit. So the only type of income that’s available is from streaming. And I just thought, ‘If this isn’t a moment to do something about this, when is?’”One of the big names on the running order for Broken Record’s Twitter listening party is the Scottish artist KT Tunstall. Around five weeks ago, she says she had an angry epiphany. “Online, everyone was clamouring to be entertained, and just expecting to get that for free,” she said.“There was general feeling I was getting on social media: ‘You’re not gigging any more, you’re just sitting at home. So why not get on Facebook or Instagram and play for us?’ And I was like, ‘I tell you why I don’t want to do that – it’s because that’s how I make a living, and I’ve just lost 200 shows this year, and it’s completely decimated my income.’”This year, she says, was set to be one of her busiest yet. How much money does she think she has lost? “Over a million quid.”She means revenue, not profit – and because the margins of touring are so tight, any money she would have made would hardly equate to riches.She then turns her attention to the streaming issue. “Labels and streaming platforms are mistakenly thinking they’re the product. And they’re not. The providers of the product are just getting completely screwed. ”Spotify is reckoned to pay out an average of only £0.0028 (or 0.28p) per stream to so-called “rights holders”, a term that encompasses both massive record companies and artists who put out their own music. On YouTube, the per-stream rate is put at a mere £0.0012.The lion’s share of streaming payouts goes to the three big major music corporations, Universal, Sony and Warner Music, who still largely base the way they reward artists on a system created when companies had to cover the costs of manufacturing records and CDs. Even in the age of streaming, these firms tend to keep most of the money generated by sales and streaming sites, making many artists’ livelihoods all the more fragile.Songwriters are even in a more precarious position. One of the prime movers in both campaigns is Crispin Hunt, once the singer with the Britpop-era band the Longpigs and now a professional songwriter who has worked withEllie Goulding and Florence and the Machine, and the current chair of the Ivors Academy.“I’ve been successful,” he says. “But the wolves are at the door, constantly.”As an illustration, Hunt mentions his co-writing of Broken, a 2013 single by the British singer Jake Bugg that has amassed tens of millions of plays on YouTube. In the first two years after its release, he says, YouTube paid him £158. His last money from Spotify, he says, was centred on a Longpigs song titled On and On, a top 20 hit from 1996, which down the years has amassed nearly 3m plays. In the last three months, it notched up 25,000 UK plays, which netted him only £5.The Musicians’ Union and Ivors Academy campaign is so far steering clear of any specific demands, aiming instead at raising awareness of a system they say is “broken”.Hunt suggests one solution could be an equal four-way split of the streaming services’ revenues between the platforms themselves, record labels, songwriters and performers. Gray thinks part of the answer might lie in ensuring that some of people’s online music subscriptions – £9.99 a month for iniduals, on both Spotify and Apple Music – is distributed to the artists they actually listen to.One of the most unfair aspects of streaming, he says, is that everyone’s subscriptions go into one big pot, large amounts of which are channelled to the major labels and a handful of their hugely successful artists. So, however niche your tastes, a lot of your money inevitably goes to the likes of Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift.In response,Spotifysaid: “The vast majority of revenue generated on Spotify is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors … Spotify is helping fuel the growth of the music industry overall, which just experienced its fifth straight year of growth.”A spokesperson for YouTube said the company pays the music industry “rates that are on par with the rest of the industry across both the advertising and subscription businesses”.A statement from the BPI, the organisation that represents UK record labels including the three big corporates, insisted that “record labels are the leading investors in music to help artists achieve success”, but also sounded a note of sympathy with campaigning musicians: “The central issue remains the gulf between the value of music exploited by the large user-upload video platforms and the value they return to music creators … The platforms can do better they just need to be held accountable.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd7118769d7aaa0837ac975a5d9eb04932dc0c10/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=241f7abcf4260188a946bb22fdcd8119","title":"the 100 greatest uk no 1s no 20 carly rae jepsen call me maybe","story":"After Justin Bieber’s endorsement sent it viral, the irresistibly infectious hit was suddenly everywhere. And still we can’t get enough of itThere are No 1 pop songs you hear everywhere you go and soon hope never to hear again and then there are pop songs that, to quote the critic Robert Christgau, “actually reveal themselves to you in that kind of saturation”. Nearly 20 years ago, he gave the examples of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want It That Way and Cher’s Believe – songwriting so irresistible, it withstands not only play after play but years of changing tastes and production.Call Me Maybe is another song you are still glad to be reminded of, even after hearing it a gazillion times. As Justin Bieber tweeted to his many millions of Twitter followers, after hearing it on Canadian radio in late 2011: it is “possibly the catchiest song I’ve ever heard lol”. His endorsement prompted his manager, Scooter Braun, to sign the artist, one Carly Rae Jepsen – then best known as the third-place runner-up on 2007’s Canadian Idol.Bieber had “never jumped out and promoted an artist like this before,” Braun told Rolling Stone. Months later, in April 2012, Bieber still hadn’t got Call Me Maybe out of his head. A video of him larking about and miming the lyrics with then-girlfriend Selena Gomez, Ashley Tisdale and a host of other tweenage celebrities went viral. Their enthusiasm was as infectious as the song, inspiring everyone from Katy Perry to US armed forces in Afghanistan to follow suit.You could not have planned Call Me Maybe’s path to No 1 better had you tried. Within weeks it had hit the top spot in 16 countries with more than 10m copies sold and 355m views on YouTube. It was the kind of rocket-fuelled, felicitous ascent that today might suggest an industry plant – but social media’s instant embrace of Call Me Maybe was organic and real, a human response to something so moreish.On first listen, the song seemed deceptively featherweight. The strings sound like ringtones the guitar parts as though they were lifted from a PlayStation 2 game. But even the most synthetic production can’t detract from songwriting this ironclad. It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater.Its power lies in its compulsive karaoke quality: you can’t sing along to the chorus without also twirling your finger at your temple and miming a phone. And at three minutes and 13 seconds, it leaves you wanting more, and more – until you eventually succumb to the repeat button.But most of Call Me Maybe’s charm has to do with its singer. At 26, Jepsen was older than most pop stars are at the time of their breakout hit, and certainly past the point of thinking an exchange of phone numbers “crazy” – but she buys into the bubblegum romance with such enthusiasm and warmth, and what could be corny is purely endearing.It speaks to persistent snobbishness about mainstream pop that Call Me Maybe is often spoken of today as a novelty record or guilty pleasure, rather than as an enduring classic. But it’s precisely the song’s candy-floss lightness that has sustained its longevity. Even when Jepsen achieved indie cred with her 2015 album Emotion, it wasn’t with the sense of “now this is the music I’ve always wanted to make”. Now 34, she continues to perform Call Me Maybe with the same infectious delight as she gave it a decade ago. And why wouldn’t she? It’s still every bit as good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4c3ec0317ddb02331b525df04172ac4f83c3641/0_0_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49848a9365915baa52b68b70584a600d","title":"the best albums of 2020 so far","story":"There’s shaken-up pop from Rina Sawayama, searching rap by J Hus and Jay Electronica, and invention everywhere from KeiyaA’s soul to Beatrice Dillon’s electronicsApple’s prettily meandering piano can at first seem benign, even whimsical, but this album – already being regarded by many as her masterpiece thus far – is full of thrilling nicks and cuts. She yelps, murmurs, lets notes outstay their welcome and generally lets things get awkward, all over a complex rhythm section.What we said: “Not so much an album as a sudden glorious eruption after eight long years, an urgent desire to be heard.”Long a hero to indie heads, BC Camplight is justly getting wider attention with this rich and entertaining record, one of the best reviewed of the year. An American living in Manchester, there are workaday references to Nando’s, Rachel Riley, Crewe and a smoothie stand in the Arndale Centre, summoning bathos that chafes against acute emotional struggles.What we said: “A marvel … this album is a masterpiece.”At 82, Bley is playing with a spryness and intention that younger musicians could learn a lot from. This set, with lungfuls of air in the spaces between Bley, bassist Steve Swallow and saxophonist Andy Sheppard, is witty and warm with just a hint of bossa nova at times, plus a quiet political fervour in its presumably ironic snatch of Hail to the Chief.What we said: “Does what all good jazz does it carries on a musical discourse which it invites you to follow. Here, it’s warm, spirited and even funny.”The Pittsburgh hardcoremetal band leveraged a glossy yet fiendishly intricate kind of production for this masterpiece of heaviness, where big triumphant choruses are pummelled into tiny slivers of digital sound.What we said: “In rock, technical brilliance can sometimes impede immediacy, but Code Orange use it to achieve total and thrilling omnipotence.”The London producer threads – and there really is no other word for the delicacy of her craft – a string of globe-ning instruments like tabla, kora and pedal steel through dub-techno arrangements, resulting in elegant and visionary music.What we said: “Workaround is effervescent, full of swing and full of heart, and Dillon never compromises on the emotion and soul stemming from its dub roots.”Working in perfect symbiosis with producer Jae5, J Hus returned for more cocky yet self-deprecating dances through a British-African pop sound he has come to define. His libido remains rampant, but he searches his soul more deeply than ever.What we said: “The charts are currently packed with British rappers, but not all of them have their own niche quite as clearly delineated as his.”13 years after his breakthrough, Jay Electronica’s debut album was worth the wait, and then some. He goes toe to toe with starry guest producers like the Alchemist, Hit-Boy and No ID with his own beats – Flux Capacitor’s Rihanna sample deserves special mention – and an uncredited Jay-Z sounds young and hungry on the mic, while Jay’s own ruminations are droll and authoritative throughout.The former frontman of the Walkmen still has one of the best voices around, in a white-blues lineage with Joe Cocker and Rod Stewart. It sits at the heart of these rackety character studies, which surge and balloon into beautiful anthems under the steam of his vocals.What we said: “Leithauser performs with his customary passion, and this marks a pleasing new direction for a singular talent.”The mood enhancer the nation needed in lockdown. The nostalgia was triggered by the funk basslines and synths, while Dua Lipa faced to the future with her confidently hornydisdainfulcelebratory pop patter.What we said: “Makes a strident case for Lipa as a pop visionary.”A soul album that uses impressionism with great focus – one of the toughest paradoxes to conjure in music – and is coloured throughout with bright snatches of melody. The result is a stunningly rich, beautiful tableau of personal and social liberation, that just keeps on unspooling. Fans of J Dilla and Erykah Badu will fall in love with it, though the New Yorker very much has her own particular voice.Marling’s songwriting just gets deeper, more confident and better with every release: here, she shares Joni Mitchell and Cat Power’s poetically observational powers over warm-boned arrangements.What we said: “A warm, fresh intimacy that feels welcome in a world of Zoom meetings and FaceTime catch-ups.”Named after and dedicated to the Tortoise guitarist’s mother, and with his daughter on guest vocals, this wide-ranging fusion record is relaxed in the way you can only be around your family. As well as post-bop and spiritual jazz, there are boom-bap beats, Tortoise-y doodles and various other singular moods.With Matt Baty’s vocals echoing like a benediction from an altar built from burning tyres, the Newcastle band channel the righteous heavy metal thunder of Black Sabbath, with even deeper notes of sludge and doom underneath. The riffs will have you closing your eyes in sheer bliss.Cher from Clueless would probably file this under “complaint rock”: there is such acute disquiet to singer-guitarist Dana Margolin’s voice. But it’s put to such superbly squalling ends, resulting in the breakthrough of one of the best British indie-rock bands in ages.What we said: “From a resolutely uncommercial background, they’ve somehow ended up making something that could be – and certainly deserves to be – big. But without losing their strangeness.”This Japanese-British pop singer throws everything she has into this summer tentpole blockbuster of a record: hair-metal guitar solos, neo-Moroder synths, new jack swing, video-game mania, and melodies that demand a wind machine with variable settings. The lyrics, meanwhile, triangulate the tension between her expectations, ambitions and reality, as well as confronting age, identity, family and friendship.The most ambitiously melodic work yet from the Italian “pointillist trance” producer, who keeps the headiest moments of raves – the blissed-out breakdowns and energetic builds – constantly going until you’re dumb on dopamine.What we said: “We’re all waiting for the beat to come back in, and Senni’s work inadvertently hymns this sad moment while encouraging us to look for the poignancy in it.”There is so much repeat-button enjoyment to be derived from this UK rap supergroup, not only in the atmospheric trap backing them, but in how each of them is nimble in different ways: Young Adz is the appealingly plaintive foil to the front-foot confidence of grime stalwarts Chip and Skepta.What we said: “A distinctive, sharp record that only these three UK voices could have made.”In a world of bland or – even worse – studiously oddball music, Yves Tumor is a foghorn blare of true originality. Having previously essayed pristine ambient, techno, and noise all while circling around pop, they get closer to it than ever with this funky, celebratory fishtail through its outer limits.What we said: “It is punchy and concise its stylistic leaps and short-circuits always feel intended … In the best sense of the phrase, Yves Tumor is off in a world of their own.”Anxiety, the evils of inherited wealth and the destruction of the human race to environmental catastrophe, but make it fun. As ever, you simply can’t take your ears off Meg Remy’s starkly poetic vocals, and her big arrangements, played by a 20-strong band, slink and shimmy with tiki-bar glamour.What we said: “Heavy Light confirms a major talent.”Katie Crutchfield calms the indie-rock squall of earlier albums to ponder her life in the bright, clear light on the other side of rain, and, leaning more towards Americana, creates an instant classic of US songwriting.What we said: “The best album of the year so far.”• Which albums have you loved so far in 2020?

Watch out. There’s a Boris about. All his life Boris Johnson has fantasised about being the next Winston Churchill, the nation’s saviour. But 75 years after Churchill declared the end of the second world war in Europe, all Boris could manage to do in his pre-recorded television statement – his minders don’t trust him to do anything live – was ide the United Kingdom. The Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish had all managed to distance themselves from the prime minister’s central message even before it had been broadcast. Forget the Churchill tribute act these days Boris couldn’t even get a job as a Boris Johnson tribute act.It was never intended to be this way. Boris was meant to be the man who could put a smile on the country’s face the man who would get Brexit done with blind optimism and a few white lies. But the coronavirus has put paid to all that. It’s a virus that stubbornly resists any smooth-talking about taking back control.And deep down, Boris knows that he’s well out of his depth – that he’s simply not up to the job. You can see it in his eyes, which have shrivelled to puffy pinpricks. And he’s lost the gift of language. At a time of crisis, a leader’s speech is supposed to be a source of inspiration and reassurance. Somehow all that Boris can manage to impart now is a sense of panic.This time at least, Boris had made an effort. Smart suit, brushed hair. It was just the speech that was a mess. A more honest prime minister would have admitted that mistakes had been made in the handling of the crisis. But Boris is, deep down, a coward, a man who runs from the first hint of personal responsibility and has one eye already firmly on the public inquiry that will surely follow.So what we got was more waffle about following the science and being grateful that even more people had not yet died. Why couldn’t the 65 million survivors be a bit more grateful? Not a word on why other countries were coping with the virus so much better than us. It must be a huge relief to the families of those who have died that the government didn’t choose to follow the South Korean science.No one could have predicted the need for more personal protective equipment in care homes (unless they had actually read the Exercise Cygnus report that predicted just that). And we would soon be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day. Boris still clings to the belief that just by saying something, he can make it come true. Not only are we struggling to reach a target of just 100K a day without some creative accounting – we don’t even have the resources to process the results in under 10 days.Having got his excuses and disclaimers out of the way, Boris got down to the substance of his speech. Or rather the lack of substance. Meet the new messaging: same as the old messaging. Only even vaguer and more confusing. Not so much 15 minutes of TV fame as uncomfortably like watching someone have a breakdown in front of you. Rather than just stay at home, Boris’s new maxim was to “Stay alert”. Less a slogan, more like a piece of advice to himself, given all the times he has taken his eye off the ball over the past few months. Even the writers of Dad’s Army wouldn’t have let Captain Mainwaring embarrass himself like that.It was as if what had been missing from the British war effort had been some blackout curtains and taking down road signs in a bid to confuse and slow the progress of the coronavirus. The one war slogan that might have been more apt was “Careless talk costs lives”. Because few people’s talk has been more careless than the prime minister’s. He’s a Zen master whose only objective is to get to the end of any one sentence, with no thought for the consequences for those that follow. For Boris there is no past and no future. And, as things stand, not much of a present.What was most striking was how little Boris had to say. His roadmap – or shape of a roadmap as he called it, making it sound uncomfortably like a homeopathic memory of a map – to the future looked uncomfortably like one of the M25. There were five exciting colours of alertness and the the promise of a Captain Marvel bio-science centre, but the bottom line was that it was still circular, with any number of still to be determined exit points, keeping alive the very real possibility that we might find ourselves back at the start.Much of it was just the same – often contradictory – advice. Social distancing, staying at home wherever possible, going to work wherever possible. How people were meant to get to work on public transport while staying 2 metres apart was not explained. He also gnomically stated that the reproduction rate had now come down far enough for us to test arrivals at airports in a month’s time. Clearly he’s been spending too long talking to Priti Patel, who insists the UK has both too many and too few air passengers to make testing a viability.There would also be some easing of the lockdown by the end of June (apart from the bits that might come sooner). (Or later.) It was all just a bit of a ramble, with nothing on the one question many people wanted answered: at what stage might people be allowed to see their family and friends again?“This is our plan,” Boris concluded, having forgotten he had just said he didn’t really have a plan, other than to stay alert and keep buggering on – something the rest of the country is increasingly wishing Boris might personally reconsider. Remember those far-off days when you thought we had scraped the barrel with David Cameron and Theresa May?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dc79386ad1090e084fbd861f52a2023405d2894/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=963215a81de50d709209e726af899132","title":"britons want quality of life indicators priority over economy coronavirus","story":"Polls finds majority would like ministers to prioritise health and wellbeing over GDP during coronavirus crisisMeasures of the UK’s quality of life should replace the publication of purely economic indicators, campaigners and politicians have urged, as polling has found a substantial majority of the public want ministers to focus on improving health and wellbeing over economic growth.The UK’s latest GDP figures will be published this week, covering the period from January to the end of March, and they are expected to show a dramatic fall, as the first quarterly estimate to reflect the initial impact of the coronavirus and lockdown measures.A YouGov poll has found eight out of 10 people would prefer the government to prioritise health and wellbeing over economic growth during the coronavirus crisis, and six in 10 would still want the government to pursue health and wellbeing ahead of growth after the pandemic has subsided, though nearly a third would prioritise the economy instead at that point.The finding comes as millions of people face economic hardship because of coronavirus and the lockdown, while some measures of the quality of life – such as air pollution and the natural environment – are showing signs of improvement.Positive Money, the campaigning group that commissioned the research, said the poll showed that the government should publish statistics on social indicators, health, the environment and quality of life to give a truer picture of the UK’s status and help policymakers better target what the public wants.“It’s clear the vast majority of the public think we should worry more about people’s health and wellbeing than economic growth,” said Fran Boait, the executive director of Positive Money. “The government must not be tempted to pursue policies that would boost GDP at the expense of lives, wellbeing and the environment.”In a report entitled The Tragedy of Growth, backed by politicians from several parties, including Clive Lewis of Labour, the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, and the former Conservative environment minister Lord Deben, who chairs the committee on climate change, campaigners call for a shift away from GDP as the government’s core measure of success.The focus on GDP means economic growth can take place at the expense of the environment, and people’s quality of life, without any of the resulting damages ever being taken into account, the report argues. That in turn encourages ministers and officials to seek ways of raising the GDP figures, even if rising nominal growth is accompanied by environmental degradation, worsening health, poor educational attainment and increasing poverty.Leading economists have called for governments to look beyond GDP, and some countries have begun to publish a broader suite of wellbeing indicators as a result.The report calls for the Office of National Statistics, which collates the UK’s quarterly GDP statistics, to publish instead a “dashboard” of wellbeing indicators, which the Treasury would then be required to target for improvement.

The manoeuvre has long been one of the holy grails of skateboarding.“The isolation for the coronavirus helped because he had a life that was about school and he didn’t have a lot of time to train, when he got home from school he was tired,” the skater’s father Ricardo Khury Filho told Reuters.During lockdown, Khury’s family make the 20-minute journey to his grandmother’s house on most days to deliver food and drop him off so that he can train on the vertical ramp, bowl and street course they had built in her back garden. It was on that ramp that he completed the historic feat.Khury was already the youngest skateboarder to complete the 900-degree turn, a feat he pulled off aged eight.“I was like, oh my God, what did I just do?” Gui Khury told Reuters after achieving his historic 1080. “I was just like OK, I landed it. Now I am going to celebrate.”The boy’s celebration was “mac and cheese at home” with his family.Skateboarding great Hawk landed the first 900 in 1999, nine years before Khury was born. Hawk was 31 when he successfully completed the trick calling it the biggest moment of his competitive career.Fewer than a dozen skaters have achieved the feat in the years since. American Tom Schaar completed a 1080-degree turn in 2012 but on a mega ramp that gives skateboarders a higher speed and elevation in which to complete all three turns.Khury’s triple spin was recorded by his parents on their phone and posted on Instagram. “I sent it to all my favourite skaters, like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist and Neal Mims,” Gui Khury said.“Some posted it on their stories and some actually posted it on their Instagram. I was like that’s so crazy, because it’s like a once in a lifetime experience. It’s so amazing. It’s the best feeling ever.”The skater’s next task is to keep practising the 1080-degree turn so he can complete the trick in competitions. Then, with the confidence that perhaps only an 11-year old can pass off, he imagines attempting skateboarding’s next big milestone.Skateboarding is set to make its Olympic debut at the Tokyo Olympics, which have been pushed back to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da59c3e38c327a884a754a6e53744d488b39e5b/685_227_1666_999/master/1666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0c3c63ca0c8b55d6d664866ae3e56ec","title":"trevor carlin sebastian vettel f1 f2 f3 formula one motor sport","story":"F2 and F3 team owner Trevor Carlin has nurtured several big names and says ‘it was so easy for Vettel to be fast’Never one to seek the spotlight, Trevor Carlin even agonised long and hard before allowing the motor racing team he founded to bear his name. Duly christened Carlin Racing, the team and their owner may not be well known outside the sport but their influence looms large. The drivers who have been through his stable have more than made their mark, with Formula One world champions among them, including Sebastian Vettel.Carlin has assembled a remarkable roster over the past 23 years but credits racing instinct over any grand plan. “I have a very good gut,” he says. “I get a fantastic gut feeling about people.”With his team in lockdown, Carlin – a man who ordinarily looks forward only to the next race, the next win – is happy to consider the past. Vettel raced for him in the Renault 3.5 Series in 2006 and 2007, before being promoted by Red Bull midway through the latter, into F1. The character and talent of the four-times world champion stood out even then.“He was the most natural, relaxed, funniest team member you could ever wish for,” says Carlin. “We would sit in the truck and Sebastian would be there watching Little Britain, laughing and joking with the mechanics. Then he would get in the car and be laughing and joking on the radio but when the lights went out he was all business. Immediately afterwards he knew exactly what he wanted to make the car faster and then he was back watching Little Britain, having a laugh with the lads. It was incredible, it was so easy for him to be fast.”The 57-year-old team owner formed Carlin Motorsport in 1996, with only £50 in the bank. They have since competed in 22 series including currently in the F1 feeder series, F2 and F3, in IndyCar in the US and the British F3 and F4 championship. With more than 400 race wins, the team’s skill and dedication has made Carlin’s team a hothouse for talent. More than 200 drivers have been through the doors of the base in Farnham.Of the current F1 grid, alongside Vettel all of Daniel Ricciardo, Lando Norris, Carlos Sainz, Kevin Magnussen and Daniil Kvyat are team alumni. Former F1 drivers include Robert Kubica, Anthony Davidson, Jaime Alguersuari and Jean-Éric Vergne to name but a few and the former Indy 500 winner Takuma Sato occupied one of the team’s first seats. Even the F1 medical car is driven by Alan van der Merwe, the South African who won the British F3 championship for Carlin in 2003.It has been a remarkable achievement for the man who has thrown his all into racing since he was a teenager. Carlin left school to work as a gopher for his uncles who ran a Formula Ford team and worked his way up the sport from junior mechanic to team management by the late 80s. There was no university or higher education, instead only racing. “I wanted to be involved in the sport and the best way was to work in it. Just hard work, which was 18 hours a day, seven days a week. You learn a lot in a short time and I have loved every minute of it.”This year, if and when the season begins, he has another strong lineup set for F2 with Jehan Daruvala and Yuki Tsunoda, backed by Red Bull and Honda. They enter a special environment, one Carlin is proud of and one he is convinced has helped his drivers to thrive.The team that was founded with six people is now a hundred strong but retains a powerful sense of being a family unit. Through it all Carlin has juggled the pressure with the sense of responsibility he feels toward his personnel, successfully creating an atmosphere attractive to drivers and their backers. The team ran Norris from his first test before he was old enough to race, to when he joined F1 in 2019.Carlin’s instinct about Norris’s potential proved correct, as it did with another of the stars of the new generation, albeit the one who got away. “We nearly got Max Verstappen. I desperately wanted him but had already filled all my seats. I knew he was by far the best prospect. So much so I went down the bookies and put a bet on him becoming an F1 driver within three years when he hadn’t even done a single-seater race. I saw him at a test and thought: ‘This kid is incredible.’ I love the sport, I know who has got it and who can make it.”The honours board at Farnham is proof enough of how successfully Carlin has followed those instincts and indeed why so many drivers owe a debt to one of motor racing’s most productive stables. The name may not be well known but that it is still above the door is enough for its owner. “I am as excited with a win now as I was with the first. I know what we go through to get us there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ef00b33222407dd29943abd2deb7cdfe117843/286_314_3137_1884/master/3137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c6ca5d967ec7f02ae1427a9b05fe794","title":"dawn of new golden age for cycling or just another empty promise","story":"Exercising is a better way to help the NHS than clapping once a week and more needs to be done to enact real changeFifteen years ago I was waiting by a red light when a dishevelled-looking cyclist, blond mop-top untamed by comb or helmet, pootled past without pausing. A couple of minutes later, the same thing happened again. Yes, it was Boris Johnson. And yes, he had form for this sort of thing – at one point he was filmed jumping through six red lights and a pedestrian crossing during one ride. But, to give Johnson his due, his tenure as the mayor of London did lead to some of the capital’s more dangerous roads and junctions becoming safer for cyclists – although a lot more still needs to be done.First the capital, then the country? Over the weekend the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, pledged £2bn towards plans to double the number of cyclists and walkers by 2025 while also telling local authorities to make “significant changes” to give them more space. There were even hints of changes to the law so that motor vehicles would be automatically at fault if they hit a cyclist unless they can prove otherwise.There is certainly the stirring of something radical here: of money and political will unlocking doors campaigners thought would remain welded for ever. Of Britain – dare one say it – becoming more like our European neighbours.But it is only a start. Much more needs to be done – not simply when it comes to investment and infrastructure but attitudes, too. Dr Rachel Aldred has calculated that per hour spent cycling, cyclists in England are around four times more likely to be killed than in the Netherlands. No wonder many potential converts feel afraid. It doesn’t help when many bike journeys involve at least one close encounter of the four-wheeled kind. Or when influential groups, such as the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, attack cycling campaigners wanting safer roads as the “Isis of London”.However Coventry’s bicycle mayor, Adam Tranter, is cautiously optimistic. “It is clear that it has come from the top, with Johnson and his transport adviser Andrew Gilligan leading it,” he says. “That said, the government’s own analysis shows that to meet their goals of doubling cycling and walking they will need £6bn.”Tranter says the long-term goal must be for bikes to be seen as just another normal form of transport – so the quarter of journeys made by cars in Britain that are under one mile comes down significantly. “Britain’s cycling revolution will be created by people of all backgrounds and sizes, in jeans and a T-shirt, and at about 9mph. It shouldn’t be the likes of Team Ineos’s Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas telling people to #GetPedalling that lead the change but ordinary people.”It might help, too, if governments felt less shy in hammering home a simple fact: that exercise is a magic pill we should all take every day. Not only does it enhance mental and physical health but, as the US surgeon general made clear in a 278-page report published in the 1990s, exercise is also a vital component in preventive medicine – especially when it comes to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and colon cancer.Perhaps a new academic paper, Covid-19: A tocsin to our ageing, unfit, corpulent, and immunodeficient society, by the scientist David C Nieman, might focus minds. Nieman, who helped to establish that regular moderate exercise lowers upper respiratory tract infection rates while improving immunosurveillance, makes the point that reducing the risk for Covid-19 for communities and iniduals shouldn’t only involve what we know already – physical distancing, washing hands and covering faces – but “regular moderate-intensity physical activity”, too.In his article, published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science, Nieman points out that regular aerobic exercise “similar to 30–60min of near-daily brisk walking improves overall surveillance against pathogens by stimulating the ongoing exchange of important types of white blood cells between the circulation and tissues”.Regular exercise also guards against obesity, which as Nieman makes clear “markedly increases the risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, three of the most important underlying conditions for Covid-19”.In the past decade governments of all stripes have been reluctant to talk about the dangers of inactivity. Those on the left are perhaps worried they could be accused of fat shaming those on the right of nanny-statism. There is no hiding from the truth – a few years ago a study in the Lancet put the global death toll from inactive lifestyles at around 5.3 million people a year, about the same as from tobacco.Yet the science is crystal clear: exercising for 30 minutes every day is a far better way to help the NHS than clapping for two minutes every Thursday.Meanwhile last week Johnson suggested this “should be a new golden age for cycling”. If those words are matched with enough real change it may just be one promise the prime minister can keep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ed99479e566ba69a9fdedf2e21f63f32caed86/0_569_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde182377e702227739e22a0be35b7e4","title":"sacha dhawan to star as standup nikesh shukla lockdown drama virtual collaborators","story":"Yash Gill’s Power Half Hour, directed by Milli Bhatia, is among a new batch of Virtual Collaborators films released this weekWith comedy clubs closed by the coronavirus lockdown, many standups have been experimenting with streaming their performances online. Here’s another: Yash Gill, who emerges in tux and bow tie, ready to deliver an upbeat, gag-packed set from his flat. But this time the laughter quickly curdles. Gill, played by Doctor Who’s Sacha Dhawan, is among the characters in the latest series of Virtual Collaborators dramas, made by actors, writers and directors who have teamed up in isolation.Dhawan says that Yash Gill’s Power Half Hour, which will premiere at 8pm on YouTube on Monday, has allowed him “to take myself out of my comfort zone”. Focusing on a creative project provided an opportunity to find balance and clarity at a difficult time. “Being in lockdown has brought such an array of different emotions to the surface,” says the actor. “It’s taken its toll on my mental health, because I’m forced to ‘sit’ in feelings, which I’ve got so used to avoiding.”The film’s writer, Nikesh Shukla, hopes it will enable “a long overdue conversation about mental health among South Asian men”. The novelist, who edited the acclaimed essay collection The Good Immigrant, said that it had been a new method of collaboration for him. “I’m an author. It’s a solitary endeavour. And often your relationship with your readers is one you don’t always get to engage in. Once the book is done, it’s done.” Shukla, Dhawan and the film’s director, Milli Bhatia, discussed issues of mental health and grief over WhatsApp, sharing standup sets as part of their research. Bhatia, whose theatre work includes seven methods of killing kylie jenner, said it had been an exciting creative challenge. “As we’re all in separate spaces, we’re working in an entirely new way, and have been reflecting on how we embrace this new way rather than thinking about it as a compromise.”Theatre-makers “are feeling grief for our industry”, says Bhattia. It is important, she thinks, “that we give ourselves permission to feel like it’s difficult to be creative at the moment. Both the piece and our way of working have been about making space for that.”The Virtual Collaborators project was launched in April by the award-winning writer, actor and musician Danusia Samal. It was designed as a series of rapid-response short films about how our lives have been changed by the lockdown. Among the 10 new dramas, released this week, are Ms Evans, by Ajjaz Awad, in which a secondary-school teacher attempts to hold a lesson on Zoom, and Danaja Wass’s In the Mourning, about a woman unable to attend her mother’s funeral because of the pandemic.Most of the films were shot indoors, such as Chris Edis’s script Self Disassembly, which stars Tom Crowhurst as a man struggling to put together his flat-pack furniture while processing some difficult news from the office. IMperfect, written and performed by Leah and Mhairi Gayer, was made on location its plot follows twins who meet in a woodland where their mother is buried.There have been many initiatives to create original online drama since venues closed in mid-March, some spearheaded and funded by major theatre companies and others masterminded by iniduals. Samal is now looking towards the future for her artist-led project. Virtual Collaborators has been “a lifeline” for many of the people involved, she said. “For some it’s been a much-needed chance to practise their craft and feel connected to their community for others, it’s an opportunity to try something totally new.” She is seeking web designers and producers, and is keen to find a way to make the project sustainable and jointly run by members of the creative community. “What’s been so heartening about it,” she said, “is that we are supporting each other rather than competing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66f3403ecd0ae1dc35460cf7651c7f3a1e5ead90/0_580_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a3c4154f4baafb3c2740ebd92e1468e","title":"the big picture americas wild young women","story":"The myth of the American west meets the energy of riot grrrl in Justine Kurland’s photographs of free-spirited teenage girlsIn 1997, Justine Kurland, then a fine arts student at Yale University, went in search of teenage girls to photograph. At a time of increasing conformity and commercialised ideas of beauty, the girls she had in mind were free-spirited and wild-haired making dens and hanging out in woods, messing about in rivers, smoking in parking lots, lost in languid afternoons, careless not only of the male gaze but any onlookers at all.Kurland started out on her quest in New Haven’s semi-industrial hinterland before travelling further afield over the next five years on a mazy road trip if the girls were on the margins, then she would be too. She loosely choreographed the groups of teenagers that she found, but mostly invited the girls into a promising setting and let them do their thing. She took this photograph of four girls in an abandoned car in the millennium year, and called it Shipwrecked. The girls she chose invariably understood the idea of the pictures. “I can always spot people,” she has said. “It’s, like, really one of my superpowers. I can always tell which teenage girls would love living in the woods with their friends.”She sees her work – collected in a book, Girl Pictures – in the tradition of American landscape photography of the 19th century, which put young frontiersmen into natural settings as a way of propagandising the idea of the west, and a vision of liberty. Her utopian scenes recreated that idealised political fantasy, and recast it for 21st-century women: courageous and vivid and sisterly. In a monograph for an exhibition of the pictures, she wrote how she tried to channel the raw energy of riot grrrl bands of that time into her portraits. “All the power chords we would ever need lay within reach, latent, coiled in wait…”Girl Pictures by Justine Kurland, with previously unpublished photographs, is out later this month (Aperture, £40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36108a2bddb675a11651d7ae6f8658e5014cce86/0_292_5304_3182/master/5304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=123daa96b68a8fa71b1016bab2b830ae","title":"barcelona without tourists coronavirus lockdown residents reclaim city inherit ghost town","story":"Last year Barcelona received 30 million visitors – now there are none. Emerging from Europe’s strictest coronavirus lockdown, how do its tourist-weary residents feel about getting their city back?For six weeks, the streets of Barcelona were deserted. Not a soul except the Deliveroo and Glovo riders and the occasional shopper, masked and gloved, making a foray to the nearest supermarket before scurrying back home. In a city with one of the highest population densities in Europe, there was no one to be seen.Throughout this time, people here have shown an extraordinary and perhaps unexpected degree of discipline, stoicism and collective spirit in sticking to the rules of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns.It’s easing now, bit by bit. As of today, in most of Spain, bars with outdoor tables can open and people are allowed to visit each other’s homes. Some parks and beaches will open, too, but only for exercise. Sunbathing is not encouraged.Not, alas, in Madrid, or Barcelona, where the authorities say we’ll have to wait another week. It’s disappointing, of course, but at least we’re allowed out for a few hours a day, and nothing will ever erase the memory of that first taste of freedom, just over a week ago, when we were allowed out for exercise for the first time.After the wettest April in a century, it was a clear, sunny morning. There was birdsong. You really hear the birds now there are so few cars. You hear so much, and there’s no need to shout above the traffic. A city looks different when cars no longer dominate the landscape you see the line of the street, details in the architecture. And we probably haven’t breathed air as clean as this since before the industrial revolution.People were out in numbers, in ones and twos, walking, jogging and speaking softly. Spain has a reputation as the noisiest country in Europe, but that morning everyone spoke sotto voce, as though afraid to break the spell.There was something else too, something different that you couldn’t put your finger on at first. And then we realised: it was just us out there. People speaking Catalan and Spanish, as well as French and German and Urdu and all the many languages of this multicultural city, but they were all people who live here.There were no tourists. None. No cycle tours, no Segways, no rickshaws, no one selling selfie sticks, no one trying to lure you in to eat a paella at an hour when no one here eats paella – indeed, at an hour when no one eats, punto.It was just us. After decades in which tourism has grown exponentially, inexorably, to the point where the city’s 1.6 million inhabitants received 30 million visitors last year, they’d gone. All of them. We’d got our city back. Even La Rambla, long ago abandoned to the lurid forces of occupation, was ours once more.Yes, it feels like liberation, but it doesn’t feel right. The bars and restaurants are shut, and many will never reopen. Nor will many other businesses for which tourism is their raison d’être.“I passed by the Sagrada Familia and there were only four people there, all police, no passersby and, of course, no tourists,” said Pere Mariné, a native of the city’s Poblenou neighbourhood. “We’re enjoying the clean air, the calm, the silence, the peacefulness, above all because we’re not used to it. But we also miss the life of the city, the good and the bad, people in the street, the discussions in the Rambla del Poblenou. The city is better, cleaner, safer, quieter and more erse, but with so much left to do.”It’s all those things, but it’s dead. Mediterranean life is lived outdoors, in cafes and bars and in the squares where people old and young sit and talk and argue. We can go out, but there’s nowhere to go. Cicero said of war, they leave you a wilderness and call it peace. We’ve inherited a ghost town.This is happening all over, of course. In Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, New York and many other cities that suddenly find themselves without visitors.“Venice was becoming like Disneyland without inhabitants,” says Alberta de Grenet who moved to the city when she was 11 and has lived there for 20 years. “Now you can see the city for what it really is, a place full of light, more a village than a city. I’m hoping we can learn something from this strange and totally unexpected situation.”“In March, all of a sudden, all we heard was Dutch around us,” says Fulco Blokhuis, a native of Amsterdam. “Suddenly you could see the real beauty of the city centre, places we have avoided for years.“We took our kids to the Wallen, the red light district. There were no stag parties, no tourists, no sex workers, no drug dealers. A memory of a lifetime.”Already Barcelona city council is talking about reclaiming the city for its residents, even La Rambla and the beach – a city with tourists but not for them. The city authorities hope that many of the thousands of empty Airbnb holiday rentals can now be reclaimed and rented to residents.In the meantime, the financial pain is going to be intense and tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. Right now we’re enjoying the peace and quiet, but soon we’ll look back to all the times we wanted the tourists to go away and leave us alone and think, be careful what you wish for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb742a220a3efe4b950fa73a88e578c1d0c97b7/62_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1c9f5a3239a24d74f4c2814db3a2f5d","title":"doreen lawrence helps on coronation street storyline about racism","story":"TV soap’s writers plan to explore prejudice faced by characters in the Bailey family Coronation Street has joined forces with the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence to work on a storyline about racism.Doreen Lawrence was consulted by the soap’s writers about the plans, which will explore prejudice faced by the Bailey family.The soap will tell the story of the generational ide over attitudes towards racism in the family and will show how Ed Bailey shrugs off a racist incident, which shocks his sons Michael and James. The storyline will also explore how the prejudice makes Ed reevaluate his attitudes towards James being gay.Ian MacLeod, a Coronation Street producer, said that it felt like a “really interesting story” to explore the generational gap in the family’s attitude towards racism.He added: “The younger contingent think you should deal with it head on, and zero tolerance, where Ed and Aggie have a slightly more ‘keep your head held high and ignore it because you will never change these idiots’ minds, lads’ view.“It’s about them exploring those generational differences between their approaches to racism, and then ultimately reconciling with each other’s points of view a little bit.”MacLeod said the makers of the programme discussed the plot with the actors, adding that “they were all saying that although the incidents of overt racism that they experienced are perhaps less than say in the 70s and 80s, there is still a high degree of what you might call subliminal racism, or more covert racism that they are still experiencing.“So we thought it would be interesting to explore the subtlety and nuances of that, and the subtlety and nuances of the Baileys’ differing reactions to this kind of racism they are experiencing,” he added.The story was originally meant to be broadcast on Stephen Lawrence Day last month, however this was delayed because of changes made to the TV schedules because of coronavirus.MacLeod said this meant they consulted quite heavily with Lady Lawrence and made sure she was happy with it.Her son was stabbed to death by a gang of racists in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.The storyline will begin on 18 May on ITV."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/851d3b7c1e87c5173b5350e793fa9620f9c2c344/1077_671_4245_2547/master/4245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f81ffa121a71db62be6aab138ced4fa2","title":"tv tonight mark ruffalo excels in a tortuous tale of family trauma","story":"The actor plays twins in an adaptation of the novel I Know This Much Is True.

As the black mayor of the state’s largest city, she has been talked about as a possible vice-presidential candidate for Joe Biden.On Sunday, Bottoms was sharply critical of Trump and the US justice department under his leadership.“With the rhetoric we hearing coming out of the White House in so many ways, I think that many who are prone to being racist are given permission to do it in an overt way we otherwise would not see in 2020,” she said.When local police forces failed to take action against alleged racial killings in the past, she said, there used to be the justice department as a “backstop” ensuring appropriate prosecutions.“We don’t have that leadership at the top right now. It’s disheartening.”Trump has commented on Arbery’s death, telling Fox News: “My heart goes out to the parents and the family and friends.”“Justice getting done is the thing that solves that problem,” the president added, saying Georgia governor Brian Kemp and state law enforcement would look at the case “very strongly”.On Sunday, Georgia’s attorney general formally requested that the US department of justice investigate the handling of the killing. Arbery’s parents welcomed the move.“There are far too many questions about how this case was handled and why it took 74 days for two of the killers to be arrested and charged,” a statement from their lawyers said. “Those who were responsible for this travesty of justice must be held accountable.”The FBI has said it is assisting with the investigation. At a briefing on Friday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany did not rule out justice department involvement in the case.On Sunday, Bottoms gave a personal twist on her excoriating comments when she talked about her four children, three of whom are boys.“They are angry and afraid,” she said. “It speaks to the need to have leadership at the top that cares about all our communities, not just in words but in deeds as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0693f94f3b09adf454720e4a6002dd55a0971ec/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39467ba09c93c8a18c60be1001eb5425","title":"coronavirus covid 19 pandemic two in five","story":"Perhaps this crisis will make space for us to acknowledge that our loss and our failures aren’t our inidual faultsWhen I started this column in February there was no Covid-19. We know now there was, but it wasn’t yet our daily reality.I am a fiction writer, an Ivy League adjunct professor, a mother to two kids. I was meant to write about all the ways there was no longer space for people like me to make a stable living all the ways this country’s lack of safety net – it’s merciless adherence to late capitalism, the gig economy, the broken healthcare system – were grinding so many of us down. I wrote, both before and after Covid-19, about my lack of health insurance. I might also have written about our lack of dental insurance, the pain I feel and have for years, each time I chew.I was meant to write about perception versus reality in what I do professionally. The owner of the New York restaurant Prune, Gabrielle Hamilton, wrote an essay about this recently – describing how, for so long, so many of us have been pretending that we were or were about to “make it”. We had checked all or most of the boxes we were told to check in our professions, even as our lives remained in constant states of anxiety and fear. Work – the ability not only to get it and to do it but to not ever stop it – is the attribute that is perhaps flaunted and celebrated most of all. One of the reasons many of us don’t share the ways we do not have enough money is, I would argue, because we’re ashamed to say we’re struggling. We’ve internalized that our suffering is our fault – that it is because we must not be working hard enough.I wanted to write about the pervasiveness of this feeling that there are no longer avenues to stability, because I wanted there to be less shame around it. I wanted to explore the ways that, in entrenched and fundamental ways, our struggles were more systemic than just us.In her essay, Hamilton speaks of talking to others she also thought of as successful who were actually just performing success the same way she did. Hearing them say now that they were one bad week or month from going under before Covid-19 shocked her. She discovered that, in fact, the lot of it has been a ruse for a while.It’s not just shame that keeps us quiet either. We keep our “failures” close to us because we know, especially in the markets that both Hamilton and I work in – art, books, restaurants – it’s so much about appearance. Is that book or that chef, that artist important? Why should anyone pay for her rent, her studio, her tour? Our pretending we’re not drowning is the proof we have that we might still be worth saving. Our performing stability is one of the few ways that we hope we might navigate the narrow avenues that might still get us out.A thing, though, about perpetuating misperceptions, about pretending – because you’re busy surviving, because you can’t stop playing the rigged game on the off-chance somehow that you might outsmart it, because you can’t help but feel like your circumstances must somehow be your fault – is that it makes it that much harder for any inidual within the group to tell the truth.In the last installment of this column, I wrote about inidual imagination. I wrote that our lives have not been working for a long time and much of that was a direct result of choices we made – I am inidually responsible for choosing to be a writer, I am inidually responsible for choosing to have kids. I might be able to abscond to rural Maine if we can’t afford our rent in the midst of this crisis. We might be able to find a way to stay put. But that does nothing for the other iniduals across this country, who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with no safety valve.Inidual shame and an inidual desire to succeed in ruthless systems has kept many of us quiet about this country’s failures. They’re now so blatantly apparent.One of the things I hope this crisis makes space for is more of us acknowledging and saying out loud that our losses and our failures aren’t our inidual faults. I hope we might begin to say out loud all the ways the system has failed us. To admit as a group that we are being slaughtered and exploited, that our bodies are overworked and undervalued, it takes the onus off of any one of us. It can and should make us feel less shame and less fear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life.From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a “corona bubble”, who can visit each other’s homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, also being discussed by the British government, opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown.Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people’s wishes to be reunited with friends and family. Allowing social bubbles to start on Sunday, Mother’s Day in Belgium and much of continental Europe, is no accident.“The physical separation from those whom we love has in some cases become unbearable,” Wilmès said, but visitors are told not to hug or exchange the typical three-kiss greeting. The government expects guests to stay 1.5 metres apart and suggests people meet in gardens or on terraces where possible. Authorities say it impossible to police the policy, so they are relying on people’s sense of civic duty.She lives in Brussels with her husband and two teenage daughters. “Do we elect a full family of four of whom they are our sole contact and we are their sole contact? That means I can’t allow any of my kids’ friends to visit them.”Her priority is to see her teenage son, who lives with his father and has asthma, meaning he has been isolated from the rest of the family. But she doesn’t want to cut her two daughters off from their friends. “I don’t intend to keep a flipchart of who is seeing who,” she said. “I think it is more important to get into the spirit of it than the letter.”There has been a lot of confusion about the letter of the policy. “The problem is that the way the idea was communicated was not very clear from the start,” said Karen Phalet, a professor in psychology at KU Leuven university. Many people did not realise that all four guests were meant to come from the same household.Epidemiologists advising the government chose the number four because it matches current capacity to do contact tracing if someone falls ill. Pairing two households also reduces the risk-multiplier effect that would come from allowing more varied mixing, but epidemiological models do not square with how people socialise in real life.“If one family can have contacts with one family for Mother’s Day, we have to make a choice, either the mother or the mother-in-law,” Phalet said. “It’s a hard choice for some families. Is it children’s friends? Is it parents or is it grandparents who have the priority?”She says the idea to connect just two households is not the way people normally socialise, and that raises questions about whether the policy can work: “If the distance between what people normally do and the restriction is too large I think it’s a bit risky.”Belgium’s “corona bubble” is similar to the German approach, where people from two separate households are allowed to meet from this weekend under the new relaxation of the country’s lockdown.Only one person per household was previously able to meet a person from another household.In theory, two families or two couples may now meet, providing they observe the 1.5-metre physical distancing rule and face coverings are worn if they meet outside.It has not been specified whether a family can meet up with one family on one day and another family the next. The assumption is that that is the case but it is yet to be clarified. These new rules will be in place until 5 June, by which time they will have been reviewed.In Spain, which has been under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, the government has said that groups of up to 10 people will be able to gather in private homes or outdoors from Monday, but only in areas of the country that have been given permission to move to the second phase of the lockdown de-escalation plan.On Mother’s Day, Phalet and her siblings will meet their 81-year old mother via Zoom.For now, the Belgian government’s main message is that people should stay at home as much as possible. “I am hoping that when contract tracing is in place we can get some social life back pretty soon in a way that is responsible,” Phalet said. “But we are not there yet.”Additional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin and Sam Jones in Madrid"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b4be8ea24c1ef85aa744c3e61a22f2722599d1c/0_120_2694_1616/master/2694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8fca7469209896693bf6be4cecc3b49","title":"dna canada first nations ancestral story","story":"The last of Newfoundland’s Beothuk was thought to have died in 1829 but new research indicates the bloodline did not die out – as Mi’kmaq tradition has always maintained When a woman named Shanawdithit died from tuberculosis in Newfoundland nearly 200 years ago, it was widely believed that her death marked a tragic end to her people’s existence.For centuries, the Beothuk had thrived along the rocky shores of the island, taking on a near-mythical status as descendants of the first people encountered by Norse explorers in what is now Canada. But their population was devastated by decades of starvation and diseases, and when she died in 1829, Shanawdithit was believed to be the last of her line.New research from Memorial University, however, has found Beothuk DNA probably still exists in people alive today – a discovery that would rewrite the history of the Newfoundland’s early inhabitants, even as it confirms the accuracy of local First Nations oral tradition.“We’ve got good evidence that we have genetic continuity from the Beothic into modern persons,” said biologist Dr Steve Carr.But while the finding would trigger a rethink for historians, the notion is not surprising to local Indigenous groups.Mi’kmaq oral history has long asserted a shared ancestry with the original inhabitants of Newfoundland, and local First Nations have worked closely with Carr to help lend genetic evidence to their own traditions.“There were always connections or friendly relations going back more than 200 years ago and when you mingle that way, periodically, things would happen,” said Chief Mi’sel Joe of the Miawpukek Mi’kamawey Mawi’omi, a Mi’kmaq First Nation in Newfoundland.Historians believe the Beothuk are descended from a group that braved the ocean to cross from Labrador to Newfoundland thousands of years ago and whose distinct culture emerged around 1500 CE. At one point, as many as 2,000 Beothuk lived in communities scattered around Newfoundland.For generations, they largely resisted and avoided relations with European settlers the few interactions between the two were defined by violent encounters.Early European settlements on the coast cut off Beothuk access to critical salmon and seals – forcing them to move further inland where they sustained themselves on caribou before finally succumbing to starvation and disease.But Carr’s research suggests it was only a “cultural extinction” their genetic legacy lives on.In his study, Carr used DNA samples from Shanawdithit’s aunt and uncle – Demasduit and Nonosbawsut – whose skulls were taken to the Royal Museum in Scotland in 1828. After a long campaign by Chief Joe’s community, the remains were repatriated to Newfoundland in March.After running samples through a genetics database, Carr was able to find his “smoking gun” – a man in Tennessee who was genetically similar to Nonosbawsut, but had no known Indigenous ancestry.With only a small amount of data to work with, Carr hopes more samples will further demonstrate a connection.“It’s easy to obtain the DNA sequence from somebody and you can count the number of similarities. That’s a very easy thing to do. But to reconstruct the patterns of a relationship is a very challenging problem,” said Carr, adding that further research into the known movement and connections between the Beothuk and Mi’maq was still required.The findings also illustrate the way in which genetic uniqueness – in this case the distinct sequence of Beothuk mitochondrial genomes – can persist intact for generations. While humans share an immense amount of DNA that traces back millennia, said Carr, the intent of his research lay in teasing out the subtle and distinguishing differences between known groups.For years, academia has ignored the oral histories of Indigenous peoples, said Chief Joe.“Academics are hard people to convince. They often have this mindset that ‘this the way it was’ – no matter what information we give them to the contrary,” he said.He described a frustrating experience in a land claims court, where the adjudicator suggested the Mi’kmaq first arrived in Newfoundland in the 1700s.“But we have an oral history of British sailors meeting our people and asking for directions. We drew them a map on birch bark. If this is the first time we had ever been on the land, how could we draw a map?” said Joe.“It’s convenient for government, for everyone, to ignore people who had no written history”The community is excited to keep working with Carr on further testing, said Joe, to further strengthen the evidence of shared ancestry.“This is a big thing for us,” he said. “But it all comes from something we already knew.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06aaa800bb7bda312444840e3edd0c62ab1a924/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c6ec6806dcd5fdd5ed8bfdae617e0f1","title":"equality watchdog urged investigate impact on bame people london mayor","story":"London mayor says inquiry needed to see if unequal outcomes were preventableThe mayor of London has called on the equality watchdog to urgently investigate whether the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people of black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds could have been prevented or mitigated.Sadiq Khan’s intervention comes after figures showed that black people in the UK are more than four times more likely to die from coronavirus than white people.After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death. Bangladeshi and Pakistani men and women were more than 1.5 times likely to die than their white counterparts, when other factors were accounted for, according to the figures published on Thursday.In a letter to David Isaac, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) chair, seen by the , Khan says the commission has a “moral responsibility” to carry out a wide-ranging investigation into the worse outcomes for BAME people that is not limited to the higher rates of deaths and critical illness.“We know that some Londoners – and particularly BAME Londoners – are more likely to live in poverty, overcrowded conditions and have less access to green space. The lack of action by the government for migrants only compounds the problem, with no clear support for Londoners with no recourse to public funds (NRPF) and lack of clarity around NHS charges for migrant communities.“Knowing this, and the fact that we were forewarned about how coronavirus spreads from the experience of other countries, this investigation must consider if enough was done to protect BAME Londoners who are being hardest hit by the pandemic.”Khan said he welcomed the inquiry by NHS England and Public Health England, which will look into the disproportionality of deaths among BAME health and social care workers, but urged the EHRC to investigate whether people from minority groups are overrepresented in other frontline roles and lower paid jobs, which may increase their exposure to Covid-19. The mayor also warned that BAME-led businesses and charities may be disproportionately affected and must not be allowed “to fall through the cracks”, urging the inquiry to investigate whether government support is reaching them sufficiently.“The EHRC must use its mandate to conduct a full inquiry into these matters and ensure that lessons are learned. There is a moral responsibility to do so. Change cannot wait any longer.”Separately, a group of public figures wrote to Boris Johnson on Sunday, calling for an independent public inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on the UK’s BAME communities.The signatories, including the dancer Akram Khan, the author Malorie Blackman and Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic, say the inquiry should follow the precedent of the likes of the Scarman report on the Brixton riots and the MacPherson report on the murder of Stephen Lawrence.A spokesperson for the EHRC said: “We are pleased to advise on the NHS England and Public Health England study into this critical issue.

France has had more than 139,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 26,300 deaths, according to official figures.On the busy rue des Martyrs in Paris’s central 9th arrondissement, shoppers welcomed the end of the lockdown but urged caution.“I think the difference is going to be mainly psychological,” said Noémi Bélanger, 44, an insurance company employee who will continue working from home. She is still waiting to learn if her children will return to school this week.“It will be nice to be able to leave the house without justifying why, stay out longer than an hour and start seeing friends again,” she said. “But it’s not like life will be normal again. I don’t think we’ll all suddenly start inviting each other round again. Cafes and restaurants are still shut, parks are closed. It’ll all take time. People feel a little bit nervous.”Anthony Gaubert, 34, who runs a web marketing company, said: “The virus is still very active in the Paris region. We should all be careful, or we’ll be going straight back into lockdown.”Annie Poquelin, 71, said: “Of course everything has to start up again … but look, the masks, the hand gel, shop assistants behind screens. It’s not like before, is it?”The French government has insisted the return to normal will be “progressive” and ministers have repeatedly urged the population to maintain social distancing and barrier measures. Last week, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, called on the population to abide by the “spirit” of new regulations, which ban anyone travelling more than 100km outside their départment without a “compelling reason”.However, in Pont-L’Éveque in Normandy, where many city-dwellers have second homes, locals complained Parisians were already breaking the travel rules.“The areas around Pont-L’Éveque have suddenly become inundated with Parisian number plates. Second homes that were closed up are now all opened and the village is teeming,” one local said.“Previously we have seen gendarmes at tolls issue fines, turning people around and sending them back … now friends are seeing Parisians wandering around all over the place.”The person, who did not want to be named, said an elderly couple contracted Covid-19 after a family from Paris “nipped down for an illegal weekend” and asked the local woman to do some cleaning.After two new clusters emerged in the Dordogne and the Vienne départments, officials insisted the country must not lower its guard against the virus.One outbreak in the Dordogne was traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L’Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt – population 500 – south of Périgueux. While only 20 people were invited, dozens more turned turned up to the cemetery and wake, some from Switzerland and Portugal from where the dead man originated.After one person present complained of Covid-19 symptoms, the regional health agency identified, traced and tested a total of 127 people so far nine have tested positive. The results of 63 tests are still not known.Local prefect Frédéric Périssat said the cluster was an “illustration of what we are hoping not to live through in the next few weeks”.“There’s a slackening off, people gather in a group of 20 or 30 and one person contaminates others,” Périssat said at a press conference.A second cluster was reported at a secondary school in Vienne in south-west France, where four people tested positive after a staff meeting to prepare for the reopening of classes on 18 May. The school is delaying reopening until 27 May.The French lockdown began at noon on 17 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8101d21511efdd2122aadd4797a61c6a3aa442a1/0_307_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721ecf06bcc8ab9d718e64e1650a1bc1","title":"hardwood logging on manus island has not delivered promised local benefits report finds","story":"Global Witness says the Malaysian company Maxland has failed to plant millions of rubber treesA Malaysian company that won a permit to clear tropical rainforest on Manus Island has been accused of failing to deliver on its promises to the local community, while reaping millions of dollars in profits from the logging of valuable hardwood timber.However, according to a new report produced by Global Witness, two years into the five-year contract, not a single rubber tree had been planted, but there was evidence that valuable hardwood timber had been felled by the company and was being exported.When Global Witness visited the project site in October 2019 they found that no rubber seedlings had been planted. However, Global Witness did observe a few thousand rubber seedlings on the far side of Manus Island.The report cites emails from Josephine Kenni, the head of Papua New Guinea’s National Rubber Board, who said that since Global Witness’s visit some of the few thousand seedlings had been planted and 60,000 more were expected to arrive from Malaysia by late 2020.But a local villager, Eddie Kalai, contacted by Global Witness after Kenni’s email was received, reported that no rubber had yet been planted at the project site.“The fact none have been planted is a pretty serious failing on the company’s part,” said Lela Stanley, forest investigator for Global Witness. “They are more than a million seedlings behind at this point and there’s no indication that they’re catching up.”“What we see instead is very significant logging,” said Stanley.The report estimated that more than 18,000 cubic metres of timber had been cleared, valued at 6.36m kina (AU$2.8m). As of October 2019, the company had declared log exports from the project worth about AU$2.8m.Maxland Ltd has an address listed in Papua New Guinea. However, the Global Witness report reveals the company is linked to Joinland Group, a Malaysian conglomerate with a history of logging projects in PNG.In documents filed with PNG’s Investment Promotion Authority, seen by the , Joinland Group listed the Pohowa project as one of Joinland’s operating locations and multiple people involved with the project confirmed Joinland was the “mother company” of Maxland.Joinland was contracted to clear land on the island of New Hanover in New Ireland province in 2007 and establish a rubber plantation. An investigation by Global Witness found that despite its promises, no rubber was exported from this operation. A local activist told Global Witness the Hanover project was “chaos”, leading to the pollution of the local river system.“No one really cared if the rubber trees would grow, it was the logs they wanted,” local activist John Aini told Global Witness.“This is the company’s track record that we can point to,” said Stanley. “I hope that’s not what is in store for Manus, but we worry that something similar is on the cards.” attempted to contact Thomas Hah, the founder of Joinland Group, for comment.

Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyWidespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers persist and are being exacerbated by continuing problems with global supplies.Uncertainty, even for those front-line medical and nursing staff treating Covid-19 patients, has increased pressure on the HSE to urgently approve use of decontamination technology being rolled out in other countries.Lack of a clear national policy on decontamination, especially on reusing face masks – normally disposed of after single use – has prompted some hospitals to seek their own solutions to ease pressures.Nursing homes and other residential care facilities in particular have no certainty on PPE supplies beyond a few days. The amount supplied in some cases was 30 per cent of what was needed. In one instance, a hospital seeking to relocate a recovering Covid patient to a nursing home for “stepdown” purposes was told a place would be provided if a significant amount of PPE was supplied.There are also indications some healthcare staff have not been able to see patients because of a lack of face masks. Although this is not arising with treatment of Covid-19 patients in hospitals, some are borrowing face masks from other hospitals.The  is aware of instances where GPs were getting a handful of masks, rotating them by placing them in a bag and reusing them after the fifth day, hoping that, were the virus present, it would by then be inactive.Serious PPE shortages persist in many healthcare facilities, says public health nurse Mary Leahy, who founded not-for-profit Heroes Aid to raise funds to provide supports, including PPE and other resources, “to keep healthcare workers safe”.It received a donation of €1 million from MMA fighter Conor McGregor, much of which was used to send PPE – face masks, visors and gowns – to hospitals across the country. The charity, which emerged from a WhatsApp group of nurses highlighting PPE shortages, has separately raised €145,000.“This is a global pandemic and we’re in a global market, which makes it difficult – it’s a seller’s market,” Leahy says.Unsustainable situationShe strongly favours decontaminating PPE because the supply crisis “is costing us dearly”. Stressing she is not blaming the HSE and speaking in a personal capacity, she believes the current scenario is unsustainable. Vast amounts of PPE are worn only once and then disposed of – mostly to landfill.The cost of weekly delivery of PPE “is conservatively estimated at approximately €9 million”, the HSE confirmed.Heroes Aid continues to supply PPE on an emergency basis. “It’s a stop-gap approach when supplies are running short in between deliveries.”She supports the use of Bioquell vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2) resteriliser, deployed in Canada and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. It enables N95 and FFP2 medical masks to be reused up to 20 times without alteration. “They’re higher-grade masks. They’re expensive and like gold dust at the moment.”This will not eliminate the need to import masks but will reduce reliance on international supply chains. There is also a need to create an indigenous supply, to deploy decontamination and to make recyclable PPE to eliminate financial exposure.Another WhatsApp group including up to 70 medics, virologists and medical device experts is trying to work on ways to resterilise PPE in the absence of a national policy.Leahy understands the HSE at a high level is looking at how best to proceed.She is aware of an Irish hospital that brought in a device to deal with hospital-acquired infections and is investigating its potential with PPE. “It’s about being innovative and creative and moving forward at a time of crisis.”Desperate timesCork-based respiratory consultant and former Irish Hospital Consultants Association vice-president Dr Oisín O’Connell says in normal circumstances a single-use approach would be deployed and the concept of PPE resterilisation would not be considered, which he would agree with.“But if it means staff are short, which they 100 per cent are around the country, then it’s back to ‘perfection is the enemy of the good’. If there is an option to resterilise a mask to allow up to 20 uses using a vaporised hydrogen peroxide resteriliser, then I would be all for it, especially given FDA approval,” he adds.He fears, however, the main desteriliser on the market will be bought up quickly by Canada, the US and the UK. “If not approved in Ireland soon, we are going to be at the back end of the queue.”Dr O’Connell says there is insufficient realisation of the scale of PPE needed in Ireland. “This is going to go on for 12 months minimum, and we will not be able to maintain supply lines for PPE, especially if one patient could easily require 15 masks a day.”Dr O’Connell says he is aware of anecdotal reports of hospitals running short of masks and “literally borrowing off each other nursing homes bartering for them and HSE procurement community teams saying they are getting less than 30 per cent of their orders”.A revised national strategy must take account of supply issues, usage patterns and implications of week-by-week Covid caseloads, underpinned by clarity on resource allocation and reuse of PPE, he believes.“Many of us on the front line would much rather a mask reprocessed with FDA-approved techniques rather than running out of masks or using a lower-standard mask.”Normally PPE is carefully removed and disposed of after each use, says Prof Neil Rowan, director of Athlone IT’s Bioscience Research Institute. Due to its composition, it is extremely heat sensitive and not intended for reprocessing. However, the virus is responsive to sterilisation.With professor of anaesthesia and intensive care medicine at NUI Galway John Laffey he is exploring decontamination solutions that reprocess PPE without destroying it. Their research is likely to inform any update to national policy.Filling the gapAfter validation to ensure safety and efficacy, reprocessing PPE using novel decontamination approaches is essential to protecting front-line workers and addressing shortages, he believes.Success elsewhere in harnessing VH2O2 to decontaminate N95 masks means a similar authorised approach is likely to be deployed in Ireland, adds Rowan, an adjunct professor at NUIG school of medicine.Their review of best evidence suggests VH2O2 and possibly UV irradiation within healthcare environments “can be used to fill this gap and will be paramount to ensuring the safety of healthcare workers”.Ireland has been ahead of many countries in evaluating the best technology but Rowan accepts that delays in changing tack will lead to supply problems.The HSE says it is aware of developments on decontamination and reuse of face masks and is exploring options to ensure continued supply of PPE. “However, at present decontamination of face masks for reuse is not practised.” It declined to comment on use of VH2O2 and Bioquell resterilisers.Decontamination and reuse has been considered as an option in emergency situations where new masks are unavailable, but it is “not aware of any decontamination of faces masks for reuse occurring within the HSE to date”.On PPE shortages, it says “the challenge Ireland faces in sourcing PPE in what is an exceptionally competitive and highly volatile global market is unprecedented”.The major supply line established with China combined with increased domestic production of certain elements of PPE are essential to ensuring supply, the HSE adds. “Every effort is being taken to ensure available PPE is targeted at the areas of highest priority. Distribution of PPE continues on a daily basis right across the wider health service, including home care, residential and primary care services.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dr Mary Favier reports \u0026lsquodefinite improvement\u0026rsquo in time it takes to receive resultsMan (40s) discovered with apparent stab wounds at residence in Clonard at weekendLoan needed after cost of new facility jumps to \u0026euro74 millionUncertainty over the reopening of allotments is \u0026lsquobad for growers\u0026rsquo mental health\u0026rsquoHSE under pressure to fast-track ways to make single-use PPE reusable up to 20 timesConcerns raised by Hiqa over placement of children in care without court ordersSpeculation about who might step into retiring Mr Justice Peter Kelly\u0026rsquos shoes is rifeAutopsies can reveal whether coronavirus caused death or was one factor among othersRoss says all necessary measures will be taken to support \u0026lsquoessential transport services\u0026rsquoGovernment passed emergency legislation in March to prevent rent increases and evictions for three monthsJudge has heard from witnesses in case examining \u0026euro45m sale of services companyDairy products placed in storage as industry leaders urge EU for further supportsCoronavirus: EU body sees record spike in complaints and queries as flights groundedPPE, testing and contact tracing will cost well over \u0026euro1bn for the year, says Paul ReidPricewatch: Readers get harsh response from Dutch-based camping operatorOne reader finds himself in a bind having taken out insurance before the Covid-19 crisisDrop in numbers occurred before Ireland was severely impacted by coronavirusPublisher North Dublin Publications Ltd has announced it is shutting down operationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4249928.1589148662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state funding for bulk of public transport could run out next month","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSources have said the financial situation for Dublin Bus, Irish Rail and Bus Éireann is now ‘dire’, and a significant injection of State funding could be required in coming weeks. Photograph: Getty ImagesState funding for running the bulk of Ireland’s public transport services could run out as early as next month, the Government has been warned.It is understood that the board of the CIÉ group of transport companies advised Minister for Transport Shane Ross in a letter last week that the companies were now facing a very serious financial position due to plummeting passenger numbers caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Bus Éireann said that as a result of Covid-19, passenger demand across the public transport network has reduced by up to 90 per cent.Many routes operated by Bus Éireann as well as Dublin Bus and train services run by Irish Rail receive money from the State known as public service obligation funding. This is on the basis that they could not be operated on a commercial basis, and last year the State provided €287 million in such funding.It is understood that to assist with cash flow in the three State companies, payments have been frontloaded this year. However, senior sources believe this funding could run out by the end of June.When asked for comment, Mr Ross said: “The Government is determined that there will be no interruption to subvented public transport operations as a result of Covid-19. We will continue to take whatever measures are necessary to support these essential transport services.”Sources have said the financial situation for Irish Rail, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus is now “dire”, and a significant injection of State funding could be required in the coming weeks.It is understood that public transport operators have availed of the Government’s wage subsidy scheme, and sources expect this to reduce any potential rescue bill.GuidelinesFurther concerns have been raised by public transport providers about the knock-on consequences of social distancing when restrictions are lifted as more buses and trains may be needed in order to comply with guidelines.The financial position at Bus Éireann’s Expressway service is considered to be particularly worrying within the CIÉ group. Expressway is considered to be a commercial operation and receives no State funding.The company is understood to have commissioned external management consultants to carry out a review of Expressway, including an examination of routes and job numbers.Bus Éireann did not comment on reports that Expressway is currently losing some €750,000 per week.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"fancy something new living room wall van gogh","story":"The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is shut to visitors but it is opening its collection to a few lucky members of the Dutch public.The museum, which normally hosts 6,000 visitors a day, is offering five people each fortnight the chance to view an artwork from the close proximity of their living room.It has asked people in the Netherlands to nominate a friend, family member or colleague living in the country who needs a lift, and five will be chosen to borrow a perfect, 3D print of a Van Gogh masterpiece in their home for two weeks.The idea is that every fortnight until the museum reopens a new five will be selected to borrow one of nine “almost” Van Gogh Museum Editions from a selection including Sunflowers, Almond Blossom and Landscape at Twilight.The reproductions, which are normally used for educational purposes, are so exact that they will be able – and allowed – to feel the thickness of the paint with a finger.The first winners will be chosen on Tuesday and the paintings will be delivered to people’s homes on Thursday, with one being handed over – at the Dutch regulation 1.5 metre distance – by museum director Emilie Gordenker.She said that that the initiative was an attempt to reach out to the public despite the Dutch coronavirus “intelligent lockdown” which means that all museums and galleries are shut until at least June 1st.“With Van Gogh Museum loans, we want to make the work of Vincent van Gogh accessible to fans and our public even in this time, in the hope that looking at the art can offer them some comfort and joy,” she said in a press release.Her words echo those of Van Gogh experts who in March called for thieves of a Van Gogh painting at the Singer Laren museum to return them “because art is there to inspire and comfort, especially in these difficult times”.The Van Gogh Museum initiative has been inspired by one of Vincent van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo, where he urges: Hoping for better times mustn\u0027t be a feeling but a doing something in the present.In this spirit, the museum has posted video tours of its collection, including the temporary display In the Picture and a painting work shop.Many Dutch museums have been reaching out to their public since a quarter are threatened with closure due to a loss in revenues without more public support, according to the Dutch association for museums.The Anne Frank House in Amsterdam has released a 15-episode video diary featuring the diarist as a vlogger, while appealing for donations, while the Rijksmuseum has a “from home” series featuring a pub quiz, digital tours of masterpieces up close and stories from curators on their favourite works of art.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"france urges vigilance easing lockdown clusters detected low","story":"France has called for “vigilance” after uncovering two coronavirus clusters in supposedly low-infection green areas a day before easing lockdown nationwide.The first cluster in was detected in Dordogne, southwestern France, after throngs attended a funeral, and another in the Vienne, western France, among school staff who had met to prepare re-opening a lower secondary school.After two months of draconian confinement, France is on Monday due to begin easing confinement restrictions, with 400,000 businesses re-opening along with most shops and nursery and primary schools. The maximum distance people can move from home will rise to 100km up from one.While the country’s death toll now stands at 26,310, one of Europe\u0027s highest, on Saturday, health officials announced 80 deaths - the lowest figure daily death toll since early April.But a new map of France unveiled on Thursday night shows a country “cut in two” with regions in the top northeastern most corner, including Paris, classified as a “red” because infections remain high and hospitals are still approaching capacity.However, the emergence of new clusters in green areas will be cause of concern.In the Dordogne, nine people tested positive from more than 100 tested after a funeral in the tiny village of Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt near Périgueux. While only 20 family and close friends attended the ceremony, many more turned up to the cemetery to pay their respects.“This really illustrates what we don’t want to go through in three weeks,” said regional state prefect Frédéric Périssat. “Letting go, family gatherings, children, grandchildren, grandparents, neighbours. Thirty-odd people meet up and just one person can contaminate a very high number of people,” he said, adding that it took huge manpower to trace all contacts.“We need to be very, very vigilant. Life can start up again but not as before,” he added.In the Vienne area, another cluster appeared in recent days in a secondary school where staff had gathered to prepare re-opening the establishment on May 18. Four members of staff web subsequently tested positive and nine others were placed in quarantine, resulting in a decision to keep the school shut until May 27.The epidemic remains active and is evolving and the virus is circulating in many zones across the country, France\u0027s health directorate general warned on Saturday, adding that social distancing must be kept up even as deconfinement begins.French parliament on Saturday evening definitively adopted a bill extending the country\u0027s health state of emergency until July 10.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germanys infection rate rises one ease lockdown","story":"Germany’s coronavirus reproduction rate – the crucial measure shows how widely the virus is spreading in the community – has risen to 1.1, giving rise to fears that a second wave of infections may be imminent.The findings come just days after the country begun the first phase of relaxing its coronavirus lockdown measures, while anti-lockdown protests have been building across the country.Germany has been lauded internationally for its coordinated response to the virus and its corresponding low death rate, with 7,549 having fallen victim to the disease there until Saturday, compared with 31,587 in the UK, which has a much smaller population.But the rise in infections suggests that the lockdown relaxations may have been premature, and is a headache for Chancellor Angela Merkel who has limits on her powers in Germany\u0027s decentralised system.Britain will be watching the developments closely as it begins to move towards easing lockdown.When she announced a relaxation of lockdown measures on Wednesday, Germany’s reproduction rate was at 0.65, before rising to 0.81 on Friday and 1.1 on Saturday.A rate of 1 or more means that each carrier of the virus infects at least one more person, ensuring it continues to spread.  Germany’s Robert Koch Institute which compiled the figures, said it that while the rate has been increasing rapidly since Wednesday, at this stage it cannot be determined whether the relaxed lockdowns were responsible.  It said: “The increase in the estimated (reproduction) value makes it necessary to watch the development very carefully over the next few days.|The findings come from data compiled on Saturday, and show that the infection rate has now effectively doubled in the three days since the relaxation of lockdown restrictions.On Saturday, outbreaks at several meatpacking plants in North Rhine-Westphalia – the country’s most populous state - prompted the state leadership to promise to test each of the estimated 18-20,000 meatworkers in the state.In the western town of Coesfeld, where 151 of 200 slaughterhouse workers tested positive for the virus, authorities decided to suspend lockdown relaxations.Despite the outbreaks, Armin Laschet, Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, called for the country’s border with France to be reopened in order to foster European solidarity.Merkel struck a different tone when announcing the first phase of relaxations midweek, reminding the German public “we still have a long fight against the virus ahead of us”.  It was a rare example of contradicting sentiments between the German leader and the man favoured to succeed her as leader of the Christian Democrats when she steps down next year.Despite the continued danger posed by Covid-19, protesters took to the streets across Germany at the weekend to criticise the lockdown measures.Thousands gathered in Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and other German cities, saying their rights were being infringed and complaining that the government and medical workers were spreading panic. In Munich, more than 3,000 people – many without masks and not respecting social distancing rules - gathered in the city’s central Marienplatz, with signs critical of “health fascism” and proclaiming: “We want our lives back”.Although there have been consistent protests against the measures since they were first put in place in March, the weekend’s demonstrations were the biggest seen so far since the outbreak of the virus.The German Press Agency reports that although the group was well over the maximum of 50 people allowed to attend demonstrations under the government’s coronavirus restrictions, police decided not to break up the largely peaceful demonstration in the interests of “proportionality”.  Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter was heavily critical of the protesters on Sunday.  Despite saying he empathised with their desire “to return to a certain normality”, Reiter told German media I have absolutely no understanding of actions or demonstrations that, due to the lack of distance and mouth  nose protection, counteract any positive developments in the infection and more likely to jeopardise further loosening than to enable it.  Reiter also said he found it “absolutely unbearable” that the protests had a heavy presence from known far-right groups. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sage committee split heated arguments scientist reveals","story":"The Sage committee of scientists advising the government has been split by “heated arguments” over how the UK should leave lockdown, a senior member has revealed.Professor Peter Horby said key experts had been deeply ided over the scientific evidence guiding the UK’s coronavirus response, amid a lack of reliable data.Scientists on the committee are understood to have argued fiercely about the use of face masks, the likelihood of immunity, and the rate at which lockdown measures should be eased.Prof Horby, chairman of the UK Government\u0027s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said “imperfect” statistics had made the task of guiding government more difficult.He said scientists needed more reliable data, especially around the so-called ‘R value’ which measures the spread of Covid-19 across the country.“There’s very robust discussions at those meetings and there are frequently quite heated arguments,” Prof Horby told the BBC.Asked whether the R rate was “at best, a guess”, he replied: “It’s an estimate. It’s based on all sorts of data sources, all of which are imperfect, and you try and put them all together to get the best idea.“What we need to focus on is improving the data streams. We need to get data much quicker on the number of people infected in the community. That will allow us to have a much more precise idea of what’s happening and that we can calibrate the public health response so that we can keep it under control.”A number of scientists on the Sage committee believe that the slow rollout of mass testing has left the UK unable to effectively monitor the spread of Covid-19, it is understood.Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific advisor, said last month of Sage discussions: “The weaker the evidence and the more controversial it is the more heated and prolonged the discussions are, and the more opinion becomes the dominant feature.”Meanwhile a censorship row between scientific advisors and the government prompted a major U-turn.Scientists had accused ministers of “Stalinist” behaviour after key advice guiding the coronavirus response was redacted from a report released to the public.One member of the government’s SPI-B advisory committee, Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, wrote on social media: “The greatest asset we have in this crisis is the trust and adherence of the public. You want trust? You need to be open with people. This isn’t open. It is reminiscent of Stalinist Russia. Not a good look.”Yesterday the documents were released in full, revealing that some experts had advised the government not to impose heavy fines on people who broke lockdown rules.A government spokesperson said: Sir Patrick Vallance and No10 agree that such Sage documents relating to Covid should be published in full, in the interests of maximum transparency, with exceptions only for matters relating to national security.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/18/TELEMMGLPICT000229647040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"teachers playing politics childrens lives","story":"The NEU does not want schools to reopen, and it does not want teachers teaching online What does lifting lockdown really look like? The government’s plan is to do it gradually: people returning to work where possible, with social distancing in place. But there is an increasingly likely alternative scenario: that lockdown morphs into a general strike, with belligerent unions seizing the opportunity to press for all kinds of demands.Last week, the GMB, the Transport and Salaried Staffs Association and the TUC all started flexing their muscles, threatening that their members will simply veto any relaxation if they don’t like it. But none has been so active in trying to block a return to work as the National Education Union (NEU).Last month, the union set up a petition opposing the reopening of schools “until it is safe to do so”, which it claimed by last Thursday had attracted 350,000 signatures. But there are no grounds on which the NEU will support the reopening of schools for the foreseeable future because it demands social distancing while simultaneously saying this is not possible in schools.But if the NEU doesn’t want schools to reopen, surely it must be supporting efforts to shift learning online? Er, no. It has told its members not to engage with lessons via the internet. For exasperated parents wanting to know when little Jack and Chloe might expect to get some kind of education again, the union says only: “Do not expect teachers to live-stream lessons from their homes, nor engage in any video-calling (except in specific special circumstances). It is not possible to recreate the classroom in this way, and the NEU has advised teachers not to do so.”Few are arguing that it is possible to recreate the classroom via Zoom, but surely that is better than no lessons. True, as the NEU says, not all children have computers at home – in 2019, according to the ONS, seven per cent of households had no internet access. But if these children cannot be provided with the required kit at home, why can’t they be invited into schools to take their lessons there, along with the children of key workers? There is plenty of room for them – when the government decided to keep schools open for key workers’ children it expected around 20 per cent of pupils still to attend. In the event, it has been more like two per cent.The NEU says it is recommending teachers set tasks that children can complete without using the internet, but it doesn’t seem to be expecting much. “Normal education has been suspended and neither schools can nor should replicate the school day,” it says. Instead, it suggests “laughing and eating together are things your child will remember”, while “watching TV programmes such as documentaries and drama, reading, playing together and talking, are educational too.” I’m sure they are, but they hardly make up for a lack of formal education.The NEU is effectively on a go-slow. It doesn’t want its members to teach in school nor out of school. Whatever game it is playing, it doesn’t have children at heart. The tragedy of its can’t-do attitude is inevitably going to be an even more burgeoning gulf between attainment in children from low-income and those from high income households.The very day after lockdown was imposed I checked the website of the independent school that my son used to attend. Already, within a few hours, it had managed to enact a plan to shift all lessons online. The school was not closing, its website emphasised, and lessons would continue pretty well according to the existing timetable.There are state schools which are trying to continue in this way, but as one Brighton headmaster put it: “Some teachers say that they are not willing to do it and that you can’t make them because the unions say they don’t have to.”At the end of this, many state school children are in danger of falling a year or more behind – a handicap which is going to follow them throughout their careers. Is that what the NEU really wants? It will then be bleating no doubt, about the unfairness of it all.I fear a showdown is coming with the teaching unions – and with other unions, too. The rail unions have been awful blockers in recent years they can be relied upon to use coronavirus as a pretext for calling further politically-motivated strikes.

It is equivalent to 602 tons of TNT, which is 120th of the TNT equivalent of the Hiroshima atom bomb.Helen Whately, MP for Faversham and Mid Kent, said the scale of the development would have a devastating impact on the lands which inspired Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe.We’re not talking about a few fields - this would destroy an entire landscape, she said. I want to see us reach net-zero by 2050, but this should not come at any cost.Professor Sir David Melville, from the Faversham Society, added: It\u0027s only a mile away from the local primary school and a couple of miles away from Faversham. This is far too big a risk to take at the level that we currently know about these batteries and their safety, and we haven\u0027t had the reassurances that we need from the government.  Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is due to make a decision on the development by May 28.Emily Marshall, spokeswoman for the developers, Hive Energy and Wirsol, said safety was at the heart of the farm\u0027s design and a battery safety management plan has been agreed with the Health and Safety Executive, as well as Kent Fire and Rescue Service.Cleve Hill Solar Park offers a low cost, safe and low carbon way of delivering clean power to thousands of homes and provides a real opportunity for Kent and Swale to meet their zero carbon obligations, she said.If built, it will be able to generate up to 350MW of clean, renewable electricity able to power over 91,000 homes. The project won’t require any Government subsidies and aims to be one of the lowest cost generators of electricity in the UK.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown phases ease steps lifting uk","story":"Boris Johnson addressed the country on Sunday night to set out a three-phase exit plan and a gradual easing of the coronavirus lockdown which will take the country to freedom across three phrases.The Prime Minister says that it is too early to ease lockdown measures because of the danger of a second peak, but small steps can be taken as part of a conditional plan, dependent on sustained falls in infections and deaths.Fines for breaking the rules are to be increased, and any second peak of infections - at a local or national level - will lead to the brakes being put on reopening measures.From Wednesday, people will be allowed to spend unlimited amounts of time outside for leisure purposes, as long as they practice social distancing.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday, announcing increased fines for the small minority who break social distancing rules.As of Monday, people who are unable to work from home - such as those who work in the construction and manufacturing industry - will be told to go back to work.Work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can\u0027t work from home, Mr Johnson said, adding that the Government has been working with employers to establish new guidance from employers to make the workplace Covid-secure.A glimpse of the new normal for workers is demonstrated in seven separate government documents obtained by The , which give draft guidelines for opening shopping centres, hotels, factories, and offices.Recommendations include plexiglass screens being installed between desks, and the requirement for workers to sit back-to-back or side-to-side where possible, rather than face-to-face.The documents also stipulate that lifts should be half-empty, the practice of hot-desking is to be abolished for the foreseeable future, and the sharing of equipment such as pens and staplers will be banned.Capacity on public transport is to be limited, with public transport operators set to follow Covid-secure standards. The Prime Minister urged people to go to work by car or even better, by walking or bicycle.This follows the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announcing a £2 billion package to increase cycling and walking capacity across the United Kingdom.It is also thought that garden centres reopening will form part of the first phase of easing lockdown measures.Reception, Year 1, and Year 6 children are set to go back to primary school after half-term - at the earliest by June 1, according to the Prime Minister - with the rest of primary schools returning as and when this is deemed sensible.He also set out the intention for secondary-school pupils who will have exams next year to get at least some time with their teachers before the start of the school summer holidays.The Government has also announced that the phased return of retail will form part of phase two. This will depend on the size of the establishment, in addition to outdoor space.Measures already adopted by B\u0026ampQ - which has reopened 75 of its hardware stores - are indicative of some of the guidelines that will be issued across the sector.These include strict limits of the numbers of customers in a store at any given time, designated queuing areas, and two-metre markers in order to remind customers of the need for social distancing.The British Retail Consortium has compiled a set of suggested rules which include having extra barriers, encouraging customers to shop alone, keeping changing rooms closed, and the use of protective screens at the tills.Brands are also considering introducing sanitation stations and even portable sinks, so that people can wash their hands when they enter a store.Retailers and unions have put aside long-standing differences to join forces, with the intention of restarting the retail sector as soon as possible without threats of industrial action.Retailers that are currently trading have taken measures outside and inside stores, introducing plexiglass screens at tills and limiting numbers both in store and in socially-distanced warehousing operations.Subject to the conditions of infection rates falling and further scientific advice, it is hoped that at least some of the hospitality industry will be reopened and other public places.This will be on the condition that these locations are safe and enforce social distancing.British Transport Police may need to maintain a presence at station entrances to ensure crowd control and social distancing at the busiest times, while companies are likely to have to stagger their working days to avoid a single rush hour.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has suggested that the use of public transport during peak time should be discouraged, in order to reduce congestion and lessen the risk of infection spreading.The three-phase plan confirms that pubs and restaurants will be among the last spaces to reopen. Pubs will probably not form part of the third phase, with industry estimates ranging from July through to winter or even early 2021.Restrictive measures on reopening are likely to include fewer tables, limits on customer numbers, shortened opening hours, more local produce, and restricted menus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11th may 2020","story":"Cygnets return to their nest after a swim on a pond in south Dublin, IrelandCoronavirus latest news: Britain heads back to work amid confusion over Prime Minister\u0026#39s advicePolitics latest news: Family lockdown rules in chaos as Raab sets out guidelines then contradicts himselfWhat are the phases to ease lockdown, and when will schools, garden centres and shops reopen?At least nine killed in Moscow care home fireThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayCan I see my family or friends under the new social distancing rules?What are the new lockdown rules, and when will it end?Monday morning news briefing:  Door to easing lockdown opened by a crackMinistry of Justice abandons \u0026#39soft justice\u0026#39 plan to free prisoners early on tagsComment: Coronavirus hasn\u0026#39t changed us that much – we\u0026#39re still slinging mud at each other Comment: A roadmap with only vague directions and no ETA.

Ordnance Survey this wasn’t. The 55-year-old new father was 1,104 words into his bedtime story before he delivered the killer line: “This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.” This wasn’t about lifting the lockdown but modifying it - while encouraging the public to keep up the good work. Anyone wishing for a happy ending was instead left with a timetable featuring only three dates. And even those were conditional on a series of “big ifs”.Appearing to have lost weight, and wearing a suitably sombre blue suit and tie combo, the PM at times took on the tone of teacher, homeschooling the nation with clenched firsts on “staying alert” and avoiding the dreaded “second spike”. Merit marks were handed out in recognition of our patience and common sense but the school report was clear: “Great effort, but there is still more work to be done.”You couldn’t have faulted his enthusiasm - and the optimistic tone of his final remarks about us emerging “stronger and better than before” was positively Churchillian. But some of the contents would undoubtedly have had the nation raising a timid hand in confusion. While welcome news for the economy that those who cannot work from home had been advised to get back to work - how on earth were they going to do that after June 1 if their children weren’t in reception, Year 1, Year 6 or facing secondary school exams next year?The nation was hardly going to toast the idea that pubs weren’t going to open until July at the earliest, either, although news that our “shuttered” shops may begin reopening from the beginning of next month will have brought a sigh of relief to retailers everywhere. Viewers will have been left hoping the questions raised in the 1,985 word exhortation will be answered in the 50-page document due to be published on Monday, such as an explanation as to why were have only just started to quarantine those coming to the UK from abroad and why we don’t already have “a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts”. And will the public really have swallowed the line about PPE being a ‘global’ problem? Despite the PM’s infectious bravura, there was still a sense that all of this had come too little too late, the over-cautious approach seemingly borne out of a desire not to repeat the catastrophic mistakes that got us into this mess in the first place.While the news on sunbathing, unlimited exercise and household sport will have  undoubtedly been well received, the lack of updated advice on seeing friends and family was conspicuous by its absence. It had been rumoured that the public would be advised to choose a “bubble” of 10 of their nearest and dearest in a bid to return Britain to some kind of social normality but there was nothing on what had been likened to the BT Friends and Family scheme.The only concrete guidance in the speech related to the Government’s five tests for lifting the lockdown - and the five Covid alert levels we need to passage through from red to green to get there (we were on four, but now we’re on three (yellow), the PM reported, earnestly, as elementary graphics popped up on screen. Why such checklists always come in five remains as big a mystery as the regional variation in the R “reproduction” rate of disease. By now, punters felt all too familiar with the scientific terminology of keeping the “R below one” - but what remains less clear is the parts of the country where it is lowest and highest, or how low it actually needs to be before we can stop queuing outside the supermarket. It would be good to know. The montane metaphor was back as Mr Johnson said that despite getting through the initial peak “it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.” We went into this on March 23 knowing it would be more of a marathon than a sprint.By the end of the PM’s 13 and a half minute coronavirus update, we were left feeling a bit like we were in the middle of an Iron Man... on Everest, with the finish line only just creeping into view.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/08/16/chinaspacecraft.jpg","title":"china spacecraft rocket long march 5b earth launch","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Chinese space agency hopes capsule can one day carry six astronauts into spaceAn experimental Chinese spacecraft has returned to Earth\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspa mysterious malfunction.The craft is part of a\u0026nbspmission to increase Beijing’s presence in space\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspits own version of the\u0026nbspInternational Space Station is part of\u0026nbspthe plans.The craft was launched from a new heavy-lift carrier rocket, the Long March 5B, from\u0026nbspHainan\u0026nbspisland on Tuesday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt then orbited around Earth before dropping into the atmosphere and landing back in China as planned, according to state media.But its mission had been hit by a mysterious malfunction with a “flexible and inflatable cargo return capsule” that was being tested as part of the launch, and which China gave no further information on.\u0026nbspThe China Manned Space Agency has said only that it operated abnormally during\u0026nbspreentry\u0026nbspon Wednesday and data is being\u0026nbspanalysed.Chinese spacecraft sends first ever pictures taken on far side of moonThe spacecraft’s mission did not include any crew, but reportedly was a test of a capsule that could one day carry Chinese astronauts into space. It is said to be\u0026nbspan improvement on the\u0026nbspShenzhou\u0026nbspcapsule based on the former Soviet Union’s Soyuz model and can carry six astronauts instead of three.The spacecraft was flying stably in a “highly elliptical orbit, with the power supply, measurements and control links normal”, the official China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation had said earlier, following reports of the issues, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.China is working on a permanent orbiting station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of US\u0026nbspobjections.Beijing previously\u0026nbsplaunched an experimental space station and plans four crewed and four cargo missions to finish a permanent space station within about two years.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Together they are expected to help contribute towards observations from telescopes like Hubble and data from the Juno spacecraft to better understand our still mysterious, huge neighbour.NASA images of Jupiter turned into beautiful abstract artworksThe Gemini data were critical because they allowed us to probe deeply into Jupiter\u0027s clouds on a regular schedule, said Michael Wong of UC Berkeley.The scientists used a technique called lucky imaging, Wong said, which sees scientists take a vast number of very short exposure images, but filters them so that only the sharpest images taken when Earth\u0027s atmosphere is stable are used. That allowed the scientists to create images that rival the view from space, Wong said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It includes tests that were posted out.\u0026nbspWe’re told 31,587 people have died. No they haven’t. It’s far more than that.”The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: “I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It’s such a missed opportunity. There’s a public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they’re hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“And yet they get fed this, what I call number theatre, which seems to be coordinated really much more by No 10’s communications team, rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what’s going on.”He added: “I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strength and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.”When asked by Marr later on the programme whether, in response to the criticism, the government would rethink the way they present the numbers, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Well, I’m sure there’s ways we can improve these press conferences.“They continue to get large audiences, but they’re designed to inform the public. If there are better ways of presenting the numbers – and I very strongly respect the professor – if we can do that, we should and will do that.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is thought he is going\u0026nbspto drop the government’s “stay at home” messaging in favour of “stay alert” – sparking further accusations of mixed messaging and immediate rejections from Scotland and Wales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailUnder the programme, passengers must wear masks to enter airports “from the time of check-in until their check-out”, and be screened for fevers before they board planes.Travel industry employees will be given hygiene training and equipment, and be subject to regular screening with thermal cameras and thermometers.Hotels and restaurants will be required to implement hygiene social distancing measures inside facilities, while planes, buses, and boats will be required to frequently sterilise vehicles and implement social-distancing measures.Facilities must apply for, and obtain, certificates using the tourism ministry’s website, in order to reopen by 1 June, said the announcement.It remains unclear how much the new regulations, packaged by advertising and public relations giant Ogilvy, will substantially decrease the risks of contracting coronavirus. Asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus are seen as some of the biggest threats, and not all who develop Covid-19 develop high fevers that could be detected by thermal cameras.Some officials also worried that few seeking a carefree holiday would want to be surrounded by waiters and hosts in surgical masks and facilities constantly being sterilised.“Hotels would then turn into pandemic hospitals,” said one official quoted by the Izmir-based Yeni Bakis newspaper. “People cannot take a vacation like they are coming to a pandemic hospital. This is against the natural flow of life.”Facilities could also simply pay lip service to correct protocols on the application to obtain certification and then fail to abide. One question on the form, for example, asks whether employees suspected of Covid-19 are reported to a manager, a measure that\u0026nbspcould be difficult to enforce from afar.While Turkey’s infection rates have declined and deaths have plummeted from a daily high of 127 in mid-April to about 50 per day, some physicians have warned of a resurgence of the illness if the lockdown is removed too quickly.But the new measures could also reassure passengers inclined to take holidays in Turkey, lured by a declining lira that has lowered prices for food and accommodation and cheap flights on Turkish Airlines, discount carriers and charters.

Below are the times for London:Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.However, they are able to enjoy one meal pre-dawn and one after sunset each day.Iftar is the meal eaten after the fourth prayer of the day, the Maghrib, which happens just after sunset.In Arabic, tar means break of a fast, and fatoor means breakfast.It is the second meal of the day during Ramadan as those taking part in the fast must not eat or drink anything during daylight hours.The Suhur is consumed in the morning and can be as early as .am.The Iftar is considered a blessing, often enjoyed as a community.It is thought not eating during daylight hours, as well as not drinking, smoking or indulging in sex will lead to greater taqwa or consciousness of God.The time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship is thought to teach followers how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.But with lockdown measures in place, gatherings will need to be kept according to government guidelines.This year, Ramadan began on Thursday, April  and is set to end on Saturday, May .The fast is  days long and the beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – meaning it depends on when the new moon is sighted.Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.The night of power or night of decree is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.Its thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan -

and that includes golf courses.There is good news for golf fans as Boris Johnson revealed Brits can go to golf courses from Wednesday as part of the slight relaxing of lockdown rules.Tennis and a number of other sports are also among those being welcomed in the first steps of ing to some normalcy.But you will only be allowed to play golf with those you live with.In his speech on May , Mr Johnson said: From this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your household.Golf courses have been closed since the lockdown was put in place as people were forced to remain in their homes, in a bid to protect the NHS and save lives.There had previously been calls for the sport tobefore others due to its open nature.MP Craig Tracey, who is chair of a parliamentary golf group, said in April: The initial challenges with lockdown meant golf had to close in Britain, but the nature of the game means it can, and should,quickly provided there are steps taken by all involved to maintain social distancing and to meet any other government instruction.Former Scottish councillor, David May, has said the reasoning behind closing most institutions to combat Covid- does not apply to golf because distancing comes naturally to the sport.He has been one of the people most vocal about clubs re-opening and has joined a petition on Change.org, along with , others, asking the UK government to allow golfers to play again.The petitions founder Daniel Palmer, told The Courier: This is no dferent from walking in a park or field, I risk my le everyday still going to work and going to the supermarket once a week, but I am not allowed to walk and play a round of golf in the open air, this doesn’t make sense under the current exercise allowance.”In April, there had been pressure on the government from campaigners to let the vacant golf spaces be used by members of the public for exercise.Yes, golf courses are reopening again in Ireland.Despite the on-going coronavirus lockdown, Golf Ireland has confirmed that its courses will be open on a restricted basis from May , .A statement released by Golf Ireland said: In the initial stage, play will be for members only and competitions will not be permitted.This announcement comes after the Irish government said that some outdoor sporting activities will be allowed.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering. They’re cooking for family members. They’re talking on Zoom to isolated elderly relatives.Millennials who had become turned off and disillusioned with public le during the partisan Brexit wars are starting to re-engage with politics, aware of the real-le impact of decisions made by our leaders.Ridiculous snowflake battles around identity politics and social issues now feel meaningless.I hope and pray that when we look back in many decades’ time, we will be talking about how the historic coronavirus pandemic of  helped create a new greatest generation in the same way the end of World War Two did  years earlier.But tomorrow my thoughts will be entirely with all four of my grandparents — Bill, Cath, RAF airman John George Wheeler and London Blitz survivor Sylvia Jean Cook — who put their coming of age aside for the good of the country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease. There were just  deaths.In  Mystic Neil warned that million could die worldwide from bird flu. The final number was .More recently, the randy epidemiologist predicted that Sweden’s relaxed attitude to the virus would lead to , dead Swedes by May . The number was ,.If the sex-mad scientist has been so wrong in the past, then why did the Government gullibly assume that Ferguson was so right about Covid- Common sense should have told us Ferguson is just a fallible scientist who has previously peddled flawed extrapolations — not some bespectacled Yoda. And from the reluctance to close our airports to mistaking Ferguson for God, we have sometimes been short of good old British common sense in recent weeks.Tonight Boris addresses the nation on plans to start very gently easing the lockdown. Many people are understandably worried about going out into the world again.So many have died. So many families have been shattered. So many of the bravest and the best have paid the ultimate price for caring for strangers.But are we really the sick man of Europe Despite our horric death count, this country can feel proud of the way it has conducted itself during this national emergency. Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage.

It is unlikely they watched the movie alone and without a massage.Literary agent John Brockman has previously claimed he witnessed the Duke of York receiving a foot massage from two Russian women at Epsteins mansion.Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors, had only months before the  visit completed a -month stint in jail following a conviction for procuring an underage girl for prostitution.Andrew has always maintained he made the trip only to cut ties with Epstein.The prince has previously been accused of having sex with Epstein victim Virginia Roberts when she was , though has always denied wrongdoing.Discussing the  visit in a widely-criticised BBC interview in November, Andrew said: Now, I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together.But the account given by the anonymous insider contradicts that claim.I think that it was Epstein who invited Andrew to NYC, the source said.The girls were going to Epstein’s house specically to meet Andrew, not just Epstein.The source identies one of the three women as model Lana Zakocela, who had worked for Victoria Secret, which is owned by Epsteins financial client, Les Wexner.The source also told the Mail on Sunday that Epstein used the prince to improve his image following his release from jail.I think Andrew was incredibly useful for him as a promotion tool, she said.He had just left jail, and to show a guest of such a level was perfect for his social capital.He was telling everyone that the prince was in the city.Representatives of Prince Andrew declined to comment on the allegations.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.The final phase of the plan to end lockdown will be to allow part of the hospitality sector to open up.But pubs, cinemas and mass gathering could have to stay closed until Autumn, because they are seen as a risk to spreading coronavirus.Restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating where diners can be kept two metres apart could be allowed to open up in July.Mr Johnson said: And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientic adviceIf and onlythe numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs.And to prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time – with transmission signicantly lower – to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She is a member of the Voices of Yorkshire choir, based in West and North Yorkshire, and the All Together Now Community Choir, based in Baildon, West Yorkshire, both of which have had members struck down with illness.Jane said: “My friend from the choir became ill mid-January. Then my best friend became ill and then I became ill in the first weekend of February.I had a throat that felt like I had swallowed broken glass, a high temperature, headaches. I was totally fatigued – I slept for two whole days which was totally unlike me. I had a high temperature and a dry unproductive cough.It was like breathing through treacle – I was really struggling to breathe and it felt like there was a lot of gunk I was trying to breathe through.Chris Kemp, who runs the All Together Now Community Choir, was among the first to get ill, on December .He said he didnt feel properly better until early February.Another singer who fell ill, Suzanne Smith, said people were suffering before there was widespread knowledge about the virus and its symptoms.She said : “We didnt really know about Covid. I work in a doctors surgery but this was before it was widely talked about. I think it could have been what we had. It is intriguing.The first officially recorded UK cases were on January , when two Chinese nationals fell ill at the Staycity Aparthotel in York.The earliest documented incidence of domestic transmission in the UK – a Brit falling ill who had not been abroad – was on February .Prof John Wright, an epidemiologist who is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, is looking into the cases.He said: “On most occasions when people contact me to say they had an illness like this last year, I reassure them that it was probably a dferent viral infection.“But this, with the link to Wuhan in mid-December, is very interesting.“We have to be cautious about assuming that this is Covid- – there will have been lots of other seasonal viral illnesses circulating – but what interests me in this case is the pattern of transmission, the timeframe and whats been described about the initial link to what we think was happening in Wuhan.“In all epidemics, when you start tracking back, you find that there were cases much earlier than expected. The nature of epidemics is they do start very, very slowly – one or two people, gradually increasing – and before it hits peoples radar its been lurking just below it for some time.“So Im sure there will be cases where people have travelled to Wuhan, who have been exposed to the virus before it was officially announced by the Chinese government, and who have come back and had symptoms or have been infected but asymptomatic.“The test for Covid- we have at present only tells us whether someone is infected at the time the test is carried out. We havent yet, in the NHS, got a reliable test that reveals whether someone had it in the past.“When we do, it will be very interesting to see Jane and her choral friends had a normal winter virus - or were among the first in the UK to experience the Covid- pandemic.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

instead you should walk, drive or cycle.And then from Wednesday, May , you will be allowed to take unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.This includes playing sports with members of your household, and being able to sit down in parks and on beaches.You are now also allowed to drive to a location to do exercise - such as driving into the countryside for a walk.Fines however are being increased for a small minority who continue to flout the rules.Mr Johnson also introduced a three-step plan to get Britain moving again, but emphasised this is entirely conditional on controlling the virus, and he rolled out a new Covid Alert System.The rules slightly dfer in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Wales is now allowing exercise more than a once a day but is encouraging people to stay local, and it is the same in Scotland.Northern Ireland extended its current restrictions for another three weeks, meaning there is no change to rules on exercise - but the government added nuanced changes may be on the way.All other lockdown measures - such as keeping two metres apart from people, and not socialising outside your household - remain in place.People who work in fields such as construction and manufacturing where remote working is not possible are being encouraged to go back to work.However, these workers should onlyto their jobssafety measures are in place.You are also being urged to avoid public transport wherever possible, and to drive, walk or cycle to work instead.Mr Johnson said those who cannot work from home are being actively encouraged to .Businesses have called for clarity on what changes need to be made to safely bring people back into the workplace.The PM has also been criticised over the announcement by unions, who said it was a recipe for chaos as more than five million people work in manufacturing and construction.Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of giving workers just  hours notice before telling them to get back to work.The rules still forbid meeting up with anyone outside of your immediate household, so you will not be able to see friends.New fines of up to £, are being introduced for those who repeatedly break social distancing rules.More than , fines have been issued by police since the lockdown began.Speculation is mounting over potential plans for social bubbles to be created, but the government has not yet made an official announcement.Golf and fishing are expected to make afrom Wednesday, May,  as long as you do not participate with people outside of your household.The RA - golfs governing body - confirmed on Sunday, May , that courses will reopen across England on Wednesday, May , but remain closed in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.Fishing and other water sports are also due to make aon May , but once again under the social distancing restrictions.Tennis courts will also be reopened, and you will now have access to unlimited outdoor exercise.Shops remain closed with no widespread reopening planned until June  at the very earliest.Garden centres and nurseries will be allowed to reopen on May  as long as they abide by social distance rules.Shoppers will have to ensure they keep two metres apart, and there will be a limited number of people allowed inside.The garden centre industry is worth more than £billion, but has been hit hard by the lockdown which has taken place during its busiest season.Wales also confirmed the reopening of garden centres.North Wales police and crime commissioner Arfon Jones however criticised the move as contradictory.He said: I was always under the impression thatyou were going to travel, you had to have a reasonable excuse to do so.“It does seem a bit contradictory – is it essential to go to a garden centre From May , you will be allowed to take unlimited exercise each day, and will also be able to drive to another location to do it.Brits will now be able to take the car out for a day trip to the countryside or the beach.Everyone however will still have to abide by social distancing measures for keeping two metres apart while out and about.And you will still only be able to exercise with members of your own household, so no meeting up with friends.It is a change from previous advice which said people were only allowed out for up to two hours every day.Mr Johnson said: You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.You must obey the rules on social distancing, and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.”Children still cannotto school as the restrictions have not yet been changed - but the government was hopeful of the first classes starting again on June .It is currently estimated just one in  children is currently going to school, despite estimates of around  per cent staying in class.Despite advice for some workers toto their jobs, their children will still not be able to go to school.Classes remain reserved for the vulnerable and children of key workers.The PM was hopeful however that the youngest children may be able toat the start of June.Mr Johnsons plan would see pupils in reception, year one and year six , followed by other primary school classes.Only after that would older children begin to , first being those in year  and year  who are doing their GCSEs and A-Levels -

Does that mean you cant meet two relatives at the same time, for example, parents He replied: As from Wednesday, people can go outside to parks and certain sports where you can keep social distancing at m, together, with others members from their own home.If you are going to the park and you can stay m apart, you could meet up with other members of your household.And he was asked again: So, you cannot meet two parents at the same time And he added: You couldthey are two metres apart.Government sources said that Mr Raab had misspoke, and he meant to say that only members of the same household can all go to the park together.Many have criticised the new plans, with Labour leader Keir Starmer saying the guidelines are all over the place and starting to unravel.He told LBC Radio this morning: I was actually quite surprised the Prime Minister said, effectively in  hours time, start going back to work without those bits in place.We needed that clarity and it is unravelling a bit this morning because I think the Foreign Secretary has now said, Well, go back to work doesnt really mean until Wednesday, so suddenly it has shted.Piers Morgan has also slammed Government advice, saying: I can see thousands of strangers in the park but not my own sons.He wrote on Twitter: So, the Prime Minister is urging millions of non-essential workers to go out to work - but also telling people we still cant see family or friends evenwe maintain the same social distancing rules as non-essential workers at work Makes no sense. I can drive s of miles to sunbathe alongside complete strangers on a beach, maintaining m distance - but not see my parents  This is ridiculous.It comes as:On public transport this morning, people were unable to keep their m distance, with one worried commuter writing on Twitter: Oneafter Boris addressed the nation! Public transport can not enforce social distancing but more people mustto work! How will this ever work Sadiq Khan warned last week it will be dficult to keep social distancing measures on public transport in the capital once the lockdown is lted.Transport for London has been running a reduced service over the last six weeks, which the Mayor of London has said is the maximum it can provide due to current staffing levels.And in a statement last night, Mr Khan wrote: “I want to be as clear as possible with Londoners – social distancing measures are still in place.It comes after Boris urged builders and factory workers to get back to work last night, adding that anyone who cannot work from home should avoid public transportat all possible.The PM also said that the Government wants to ensure everyone is safe at work with new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure.He said: We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transportat all possible – because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited.So work from homeyou can, but you should go to workyou can’t work from home.The roads are likely to be busier from now on, after Boris gave the green light to take cars on day trips from Wednesday.Addressing the nation, the PM said last night: From this Wednesday we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.And its clear that cooped up Brits have already started to hit the roads.Last week, deputy chief scientic adviser Dame Angela McLean warned the rise in car use during the lockdown was troubling.She told the daily No  press conference: For motor vehicles what you see is a pattern that looks a bit like commuting because its low every weekend and we do worry about that creeping up.I think all of us remember that what weve done together which is to stay home has worked to protect the NHS and save lives and as one of the people who looks at this data and thinks about how it fits into how we think about the future it does trouble me that the dark blue line [use of motor vehicles] is creeping up again."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers demand pupils sprayed disinfectant coronavirus","story":"TEACHERS have demanded children be sprayed front and back with disinfectant at the school gates - as they reacted with alarm to the PMs announcement schools could reopen in three weeks.Last night, Boris Johnson said a phased reopening of schools in England could potentially begin from June ,transmission can be reduced.As he announced plans to gradually loosen the lockdown, the Prime Minister said by June  we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year One and Year Six.Secondary schools are not likely to open again until at least September, although those facing exams will get some time with their teachers before the summer holidays.But even this staggered approach caused alarm among school staff, with the leader of the largest teaching union calling it reckless.It comes as:Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: We think that the announcement by the Government that schools may reopen from June  with reception and Years One and Six is nothing short of reckless.Coronavirus continues to ravage communities in the UK and the rate of Covid- infection is still far too great for the wider opening of our schools.Dr Bousted added: In China, children stand outside the school gates and are sprayed front and back with disinfectant, their shoes are sprayed, they wash their hands with sanitiser, they must take off their mask and replace it with a new one, and their temperature is taken remotely.Askeda similar regime should be introduced here, she said: Yes. Theyre doing that in China and South Korea and they have a minuscule number of new cases.The NEU said  per cent of , members said they disagreed with plans to restart lessons from June , while  per cent said they would not feel safe with the proposed wider opening of schools.Dr Bousted urged the Government to meet five tests set out by teaching unions, which includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipment and local powers to close schoolsclusters of coronavirus infections break out in a particular area.If schools are re-opened to blatant breaches of health and safety, we will strongly support our members taking steps to protect their pupils, their colleagues and their families, she added.The worst outcome of any wider re-opening of schools is a second spike of Covid- infection.A senior head connected with one of the unions said a lot of staff were anxious.He said: If teachers refuse to come in and are not in a vulnerable group then they will have to take unpaid leave, in my view.Weve got to have staff in to run classes. You can accommodate home working for some jobs, such as admin, but apart from a few roles you have to have teachers there.The National Association of Head Teachers, whose members are mostly primary heads, said: There is not a school leader in the land who wants to risk admitting more pupils unless it is perfectly clear that it is safe.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that social distancing is extremely dficult with children in reception and year one.We are not trying to impede the reopening of schools, he said.Throughout the crisis we have highlighted the importance of bringing in more pupils when the time is right to do so and there is a clear plan in place to manage it safely.Unfortunately, we are not persuaded that either of these two simple tests has yet been met.Union NAHT, which represents leaders in the majority of schools, said the announcement was likely to lead to questions from anxious parents.A source close to Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said teachers and heads had been consulted over theto school.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It comes after Boris Johnson unveiled three stages of reopenings in his aposroadmapapos for easing lockdown.The first stage from this Wednesday will see some lockdown restrictions eased in England - with people able to take unlimited exercise and go for a drive. The second stage from June  at the earliest will see primary schools and some aposnon-essentialapos shops begin to reopen.  Then the third stage from July  at the earliest will see some venues in the hospitality industry partially reopen. It is understood other public spaces such as cinemas and places of worship could also reopen in this wave.  All reopenings would be conditional on firms keeping people  metres apart - and any dates could well be put backthe plan to control the virus slips. Boris Johnson said last night: Step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientic adviceand onlythe numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.  Today Foreign Secretary Mr Raab said the government was looking at July  at the very earliest for phase three. He said those sectors are inherently more dficult because people are mixing together and its dficult to maintain social distancing.We wouldn’t be able to say… that we would start them at least, at least until July . “We’ll see where we get to”. Asked on Sky Newshis comments meant pubs and restaurants could begin to reopen from July , Mr Raab replied: What we’re saying is those wouldn’t even be considered until step .  Boris Johnson last night announced the first steps to easing the lockdown he imposed seven weeks ago to deal with coronavirus.People in England will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, sit and sunbathe in parks and on beaches, and go for a drive from Wednesday. But the vast majority of rules imposed on March  remain in place - as Mr Johnson warned this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Schools and all non-essential shops will remain shut until at least June, with pubs expected to be closed beyond July.

But the Government’s plan has been met with confusion from the public, with many reacting onlinelast night saying they are unsure what the Tories’ new “Stay alert” slogan means in practice.And the PM’s loosening of the rules is at odds with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, whose leaders are sticking to tighter restrictions for the rest of this month, with only minimal tweaks to current regulations. There will be no wider relaxation of rules in England until June. The Government stressed that its plan for the weeks ahead is “conditional” and could be changed at any time. In a televised address, the Prime Minister confirmed that, as a first step, we will be allowed to drive for country or beach walks and do unlimited exercise from Wednesday. People can play sports outdoors with members of their households. They can also sunbathe, sit and read a book or chat with one friend from outside their household in a park as long as they stay two metres apart. Garden centres in England will also be allowed to reopen from Wednesday, senior Government sources confirmed. MPs will get more details today when Mr Johnson gives a statement to the Commons and publishes a -page document setting out his full “roadmap” for ending lockdown. But there are fears that some of the measures are overly optimistic and le will notto normal this year. Mr Johnson warned the plans would only go aheadthe public continued to follow the rules and keep the R rate of transmission – currently between . and . – below one. He said: “Throughout the next two months, we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by science, the data and public health. “All of this is conditional. It depends on all of us to follow the advice.” The PM will today set out details on out how to make workplaces safer. It could mean staggered sht patterns and barriers placed between workers. He said: “Anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction and manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work”.  He urged workers to avoid public transport “ at all possible” as capacity will be severely limited due to social distancing.Unions and Labour raised concerns about workers’ safety and whether rogue bosses would follow the guidance.Mr Johnson said the second step would be for a phased reopening of primary schools and nurseries at the start of June at the earliest. At the same time, clothes and shoe shops could reopen, although hairdressers will have to wait. Year  and  pupils are the only secondary years set tobefore September. Head teachers have warned they will need guidance on social distancing. Around the same time, passengers arriving at British airports will be subject to  days quarantine. The Government has been criticised for not bringing in border controls sooner.  The final step – in July at the earliest – is the reopening of some hospitality venues and other public places. Government sources said this could include cafes in parks, restaurants with outside space and cinemas, with social distancing measures. But it does not include pubs, which look unlikely to reopen this year. But churches and mosques could reopen. Mr Johnson warned: “You must obey the rules on social distancing. To enforce those rules, we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.” Fines will be hiked up to £ – up from £. Fines will be doubled for each repeat offence, up to a maximum of £,. Mr Johnson unveiled a five-tier warning system, ranging from green at level one to red at level five to flag the risk in dferent parts of the country.

People in England will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, sit and sunbathe in parks and on beaches, and go for a drive from Wednesday. But the vast majority of rules imposed on March  remain in place - as Mr Johnson warned this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. And Dominic Raab was forced to clary today that visits to friends and familiesapos homes are still banned. While two people from two households can sit m away in the park, people cannot mix within homes and gatherings of more than  people in public are banned unless youaposre from the same household.  Schools and all non-essential shops will remain shut until at least June, with pubs expected to be closed beyond July. And with the risk that the virus could run rampant again, the fine for breaching remaining rules will be almost doubled to £, up to a cap of £,. But those who canapost work from home are being urged toto work from Wednesday. And the overall message has switched from stay at home to stay alert - a situation that has prompted alarm and anger.Many say even the limited easing comes far too soon - with England still seeing thousands of new Covid- infections and hundreds of deaths per day. And Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all stopped short of easing the lockdown in the way Boris Johnson has. Labour leader Keir Starmer warned: This statement raises more questions than it answers. We see the prospect of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pulling in dferent directions. The Prime Minister appears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work without a clear plan for safety or clear guidance as to how to get there without using public transport. What the country wanted tonight was clarity and consensus, but we havenapost got either of those. The Police Federation of England and Wales warned of extreme pressure being placed on the officers it represents by the relaxation of rules. National chairman John Apter said: What we need from the Prime Minister and the Government now is clear and unambiguous messaging and guidance, explaining what exactly is expected of the public, so that my colleagues can do their level best to police it. The changes this week come into effect this Wednesday - because they need time to be enacted in Parliament - and apply to England only. While some of these changes also apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, it is for those governments to decide exactly how to proceed. Fuller details will emerge on Monday at pm when the Prime Minister publishes a roadmap to Parliament. But so far, hereaposs what we know.  things you can do from Wednesday . Exercise more than once per day From this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise, Boris Johnson announced. That means the rule that you could only take exercise once per day looks set to be scrapped. The aposonce a dayapos rule was never laid down in the law, but it was in government guidance since March .  . Sit in the park -  metres from others From Wednesday you will no longer have to keep moving all the time in parks and other public places . It is understood you will be allowed to sit and sunbathe or read a book, for example. The condition is that you must be at least  metres from people outside your own household.  . Sunbathe on the beach -  metres from others The same rules that apply to parks will apply to beaches. That means you can sunbathe or read a book on a beach, just as you could in the park. Again, you may only do this with members of your own household. You must be at least  metres from all other households.  . Drive to other places foroutdoor activity Boris Johnson said in his speech that you can drive to other destinations from Wednesday. It has not yet been spelt out what this means. It suggests you will be able to drive to national parks or beaches that are not within walking distance of your home. However, people must wait until the full roadmap to be published on Monday for fuller details. . Meet one friend or relative in the park -you stay two metres away from each other Government officials said that from Wednesday, you may sit with someone from another household in public under certain circumstances. Those areyou stay  metres apart - andthere are only two of you, one from each household. So for example, one person can meet another person from a separate household in a socially distanced way and chat from  metres away.

But you canapost bend the rule to have a very spread-out party in the park with your mates. Dominic Raab prompted confusion around this this morning when he said you could meet more than one family member in the park at a time,you stay two metres apart. But the law states that gatherings of more than two people from dferent households are banned. . Play golf and tennis - but only with members of your own household Golf courses and tennis courts will be allowed to open from Wednesday in England. However, you would still have to play only with members of your own household. Other sports may be allowed but there is no word on football - which obviously cannot be carried out in a socially distanced way, and usually needs more people than are in the average household. . Go angling and swim in lakes and the sea Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and  metres from other households. You can also swim in lakes and the sea as long as you’re socially distant - but not outdoor swimming pools. Or indoor swimming pools, which like gyms remain closed for the foreseeable. . Go back to work -you canapost work from home This is more a should do than a can do. Boris Johnson announced a change in emphasis - rather than strictly a change in the rules - from this week for who should and shouldnapost be at work. He said: Anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. Work from homeyou can, but you should go to workyou can’t work from home. The Prime Minister said the government has been working to establish new guidance for firms to make workplaces safe. But he did not say when it would be published - which is likely to spark fears over how workers will be kept safe or whether theyaposll all be  metres apart.   things you canapost do . Have any kind of gathering with people outside your householdNone of the changes the PM has announced say you can gather with multiple people from outside your household. While full details will be confirmed on Monday lunchtime, this indicates you can still be fined for having a party or a group of more than two - unless youaposre from the same household. And you can still be fined for having a big gathering of people in the park or on the beach, evenyou remain  metres apart. The exceptions are the same as they were before - an essential work gathering funerals necessary house moves, or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person. You may also provide emergency assistance, or participate in legal proceedings or fulfil a legal obligation. The one change is that one person from one household can sit in the parkwith one person from another household, as described earlier in this article.  . Visit friends or family Because you cannot gather with people from outside your household, this indicates you still cannot visit friends and family members at their home. This would be the same as it was before. Exceptions already existed for supporting a vulnerable person - i.e., bringing food or medicine to an elderly relative. . Go to non-essential shops or pubs, bars or restaurants  Pubs, bars and restaurants remain shut for the foreseeable future. Non-essential shops that are currently closed also have no reopening date, and wonapost reopen until June at the earliest. Boris Johnson outlined a step three in coming out of lockdown in July which will see some places in the hospitality industry reopen. However, itaposs not thought this will include pubs - even beer gardens. Instead itaposs likely to be a limited reopening of some outdoor cafes or restaurants that have an outdoor dining area where groups can be kept m apart. Itaposs understood cinemas and places of worship may be among other sites that can reopen in around July - again,they can keep people  metres apart. Gyms and indoor swimming pools, along with the vast majority of other businesses that shut in March, remain closed and there is currently no date for them to reopen. . Play football Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested people will not be allowed to play football under the relaxed lockdown rules. He told BBC Breakfast: No I donapost think so because you canapost stay two metres apart. So, we do want people to play more sport and let me give you one example of something you can do. Two people from the same home could go and play tennis, because thataposs something where they could stay two metres apart from everyone . What you couldnapost then do, and this is why we say youaposve got to stay alert, you couldnapost then go into the clubhouse and mill around where you will be within two metres of other people. So, football would be one of those where I think would be very dficult to stay two metres apartyouaposre playing, you know, -a-side or even five-a-side. . Drive to Scotland or Wales Dominic Raab told BBC Breakfast: You can drive as far as you want to drive to go and walk in a park or a particular area that youaposre fond of as long as you maintain the social distancing. But obviously,youaposre going from one part of the UK to another, soyouaposre going from England to Wales or from Scotland to Wales and dferent rules are in place because the devolved administrations take a dferent approach you need to be very mindful of the regulations that theyaposve got in place. . Go outyou are one of .million people being aposshieldedapos There is no change to guidance for the .million people in England who are “shielded” because they are exceptionally clinically vulnerable. These are the people who were told to stay indoors for  weeks due to a specic medical condition that makes them vulnerable to Covid-. Those in this group are meant to have been told directly. . Send your children to school - though that will change soon for primaries At the moment, schools remain closed except for the children of key workers. However, that will change. The government is hoping all primary school pupils in England will be back in class for at least a few weeks before the summer holidays. Returns will begin from June  at the earliest with nurseries and primary years R,  and . Other primary year groups would followit is possible before the summer holidays. However, all timings are still conditional on the virus being brought down to an acceptable level in the UK. They could all be pushed back.  Secondary school pupils in England will not resume lessons at all before the summer, it is understood. Only Years  and  are scheduled toto schools before September in the PM’s lockdown ‘roadmap’. But while this will involve face-to-face contact with teachers, these will be support for home learning. There are no plans for secondary school lessons in the usual sense before the break, sources confirmed. Government sources said the realistic time period for secondary school lessons to fully resume is September. . Break any of the lockdown rules - otherwise youaposll face an increased fine While some of the lockdown rules are being eased, the fine for breaking the ones that are still in place will be increased. The starting point for a first offence will now be £ - almost double the £ previous rate. That will halve to £paid within  days. But for repeat offenders it will double on each subsequent offence up to a limit of £,. . Go on public transport,you can help it Boris Johnson urged a nationwide push to come off public transport. He said: When you do go to work,possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. Just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards. London mayor Sadiq Khan has previously warned the number of people on Tubes and buses must be drastically cut to keep people  metres apart.

Primary schools could reopen next month and there is a plan for cafes and restaurants to start serving customers in July. But Mr Johnson faces possible disagreements with leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland whose leaders have already heavily criticized the new aposstay alertapos messaging, first unveiled last night. These are the earliest possible dates and are subject to change depending upon the aposRaposrate andthat surges above the crucial number of one. A new Covid Alert System is being set up determined mainly by the reinfection rate and the number of cases. The alert levels will be one to five and the higher the level, the tougher social distancing measures will have to be. The PM said the UK had been in Level Four but we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three. TomorrowWith just  hours notice Boris Johnson told people who could could not work from home to go to work.The Prime Minister said from this week, anyone who canapost work from home including construction and manufacturing workers will be actively encouraged toto their job. Unions warned his speech was a recipe for chaos - as vital guidelines on how firms should keep workers safe have still not been published.  And Mr Johnson said people should avoid public transport, using private cars, walking or cycling where possible - hours before Monday morning. Wednesday May  From May  people in England will be allowed to spend as much time as they like exercising outdoors - but they must continue to follow social distancing guidelines. They cannot meet in groups of people outside of their household but activities such as tennis and gold are allowed - provided theyaposre played within the same household. You can also sit in the park or on a beach and sunbathe on your own or with members of the same household.Read the full list here.  The National Trust said it was reviewing plans for reopening sites following Boris Johnsonaposs speech. Following the Prime Ministeraposs broadcast outlining the Governmentaposs gradual road map out of lockdown, we will begin to review its effect on our reopening plans, a spokeswoman said. Last week, the trust said it was working on plans to reopen sites, which have been shut to the public since March . Late May early June A -day quarantine is to be placed on all air passengers arriving into the UK - aside from France. This includes Brits ing from a foreign holiday although this is understood to be a low number as tens of thousands have already been repatriated by the Foreign Office at this point.  Government official said quarantine is a few weeks away from happening yet, adding: What the scientic advice tells you is that when domestic transmission is high, imported cases represent a small amount of the overall total and make no signicant dference to the epidemic. However, this can change when the domestic transmission rate of infection is low and people are arriving from countries with a higher rate of infection. June  Primary schools will reopen for the first time since March  to all children and not just those whose parents are key workers. But it will be in phases with reception and years one and six going first followed by other years in the following weeks - provided the R rate remains low. Secondary schools will remain closed entirely apart from years  and , who are expected tofor some transition help with home schooling but there will not be traditional lessons featuring large numbers of children and teenagers in classrooms.  July England would re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. However, itaposs not thought this will include pubs - even beer gardens. Instead itaposs likely to be a limited reopening of some outdoor cafes or restaurants that have an outdoor dining area where groups can be kept m apart.  Itaposs understood cinemas and places of worship may be among other sites that can reopen in around July - again,they can keep people m apart. August It is understood pubs will not be able to reopen in July. Even August could very well be too soon. The truth is there is simply not a date - but August appears to be the very, very earliest according to government sources. he British Beer  Pub Associationhas warned that up to % of Britainaposs pubs cannot survive beyond September with the current level of financial support being offered by the Government.It estimates that almost , pubs may not be able to reopen following the  coronavirus  crisis.September Secondary school lessons to finally resume  - but classrooms may have dramatically changed by this point with less pupils per class or phased openings.  By this stage the government hopes to have a better handle on how the lockdown lting measures are affecting the R rate. But this whole schedule could change Boris Johnson promised to put on the brakesCovid- cases show signs of increasing as lockdown measures are eased. In an effort to reassure a nervous public about adjusting to living with coronavirus, the Prime Minister insisted he would not do anything that would risk a second peak in infections. Under the test, track and trace programme - with the help of the new NHS Covid- app currently being trialled on the Isle of Wight - officials hope to identy and isolate any new outbreaks before the infection gets out of control. In his address to the nation setting out a road map out of the lockdown, Mr Johnson saidthere are outbreaks,there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes.

Previously the government had said people should only go to workyou must -youaposre an essential worker. But it is now changing the emphasis of the advice so that anyone who cannot work from home is being actively encouraged toto work from Wednesday. This includes people who work in construction or manufacturing, or other fields where remote working is not an option.  People are still, however, being urged to avoid public transport wherever possible, and drive, walk or cycle to work instead. Social distancing measures should be followed in the workplace to ensure that employees remain at a safe distance from each other. The details are unclear but are expected to be fleshed out in a  page guidance document at pm today.

However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has this morning claried it kicks in from Wednesday. You can still only send your children to schoolyou are a key worker - so it is unclear what happens with childcare to people being asked toto work. There has been much criticism of Johnsonaposs decision to encourage people toto work so suddenly.

He added: We havenapost got the guidelines, and we donapost know how itaposs going to work with public transport so thereaposs a huge number of questions arising out of this. John Phillips, acting GMB General Secretary, pointed out that many people don’t have the luxury of being able to avoid public transport.

As well as that, his strong work ethic and keen sense of order was greatly at odds with the rest of his chaotic family. Feeling like such an outsider made Joey miserable throughout his le. But when he began digging around for answers about his identity, little did he anticipate the scale of the genetic – and ethical – minefield he was about to step into. While he was growing up in Rotterdam, Holland, Joey’s parents never hid the fact they had needed help conceiving him. His dad – who already had two kids from a previous marriage – had gone through a vasectomy reversal for Joey’s mum. ‘They told me they went to a doctor because of my father,’ explains Joey, . ‘They undid the procedure because my mum really wanted to have children of their own.’ Joey’s parents insisted the fertility treatment they’d received had been straightforward – his mother had been articially inseminated with his father’s sperm. But Joey was unconvinced by this explanation: ‘I was just so dferent from my brother and sister.’ While Joey’s father drank, argued, and was constantly in debt selling the kids’ belongings for cash, Joey by contrast was sensible, calm and early on began saving for a better le. Eventually, sick of feeling so isolated, at just  Joey met his first boyfriend, moved in with him, and left his family home – for ever. ‘It was the best decision I ever made,’ he admits.  By the time Joey was , he was a successful gym owner and in a stable, loving relationship. But even though he’d been able to escape the chaos of his family home, he was dogged with unease about his identity. It nagged away at him until his father died in  and – believing he’d never get to the bottom of it – Joey’s mental health spiralled. ‘Close friends saw it was really bothering me. It became a depression when my father passed away. I thought it was grief, but it never stopped. I felt, “Maybe I’m never going to know what happened ” aposAfter three or four years, I was still in a state of depression and I didn’t want to get out of bed. It was the worst feeling I’d ever had.’  When Joey considered suicide, his psychiatrist urged him to confront his mother. So, in March , after making her a coffee and sitting her in the garden, Joey begged her for answers. ‘“Is my father my biological father  Did something happen to you  Or am I from a neighbour or somebody  ” Mum was quite upset when I asked her that. She couldn’t believe I thought she might have been with another man. It distressed her, me thinking she had been unfaithful, but I just said, “Mum, please. I have to know for sure.”’ Joey asked her to take him through exactly how he was conceived, and she said she’d seen the vials of sperm labelled with the name of Joey’s father.  When pressed on the name of the clinic and doctor, his mum’s patchy recollections led Joey to do an online search, which brought up a suburban clinic near where he grew up and the doctor Jan Karbaat. Joey was shocked to see many complaints about missing paperwork and lost vials, suspicions that women had been given the wrong sperm, and also a court case. The government had shut the clinic in . It was a horror story. Joey’s mother was so upset by these findings, she threw her son out of the house there and then. Continuing to Google Jan Karbaat sitting in his car, Joey spotted a photo of the fertility doctor behind the scandal, and got goosebumps, certain he was looking at his biological father. ‘It was like an electric shock. I couldn’t see his face, only myself. I had the same smile, the same eyes. I sent the picture to friends, they said, “Is that you, Joey ”’ Desperate for answers, Joey tracked down Karbaat, who was living locally. But when he knocked on his door, he was told the doctor, then , was too sick for visitors. A week later, he died. Robbed of the opportunity to confront him, Joey searched for answers where. He discovered a Facebook group whose members suspected they were all Karbaat’s children. Joey quickly built a rapport with Moniek Wassenaar, and noticed her Amsterdam home was strikingly similar in taste to his own. ‘We decided to seewe were really related and did a test – we were indeed half-siblings. That was the first match. It was very emotional.’  Then, in June , Joey put his results on a genealogy site that matches DNA results with others around the world. It paired him with Inge Herlaar, , who he rang, saying, ‘I think I’m your half-brother.’ Then came a match with Marsha Elvers, , another half-sister. At the time of Karbaat’s death in , he was thought to have had  recognised children from several marriages, and was suspected of secretly fathering  more with his patients – without their permission. In early  a court decision was ruled allowing Karbaat’s DNA to be released for testing. Receiving the confirmation he was Karbaat’s son was momentous for Joey. ‘When I saw it written down, I broke,’ he admits. ‘It was almost too much to process.’ Joey has at least  known siblings and the family keeps growing. With dark humour they’ve called themselves the ‘Karbastards’. ‘Now, I’m no longer angry – but I am curious,’ says Joey. ‘I have the puzzle in my head, but I can’t put the pieces together. ‘Maybe he did it because of the money, maybe he had a God complex. That’s what everyone says. But I think, at the start, he just wanted to help mothers have children.’ Last month, Joey visited Karbaat’s grave in Rotterdam. ‘It was the closest I could get to him. That was the most important thing so I could have peace of mind. I’m not responsible for his wrongdoings and his actions, but I need to forgive him to move on. I deserve that.’ Three more fertility doc outrages Shockingly, Jan Karbaat is not the only doctor to have committed fertility fraud – but no fertility doctor has ever been put behind bars for using their own sperm.  Donald Cline In May  it emerged that physician Donald Cline, who’d featured in People magazine, had used his own sperm in the s and s while treating women in Indianapolis. Cline was exposed after one of the people conceived at his clinic took a andMe DNA test, only to discover several unexpected half-siblings, whose mothers had all been Cline’s patients. Norman Barwin A pillar of the Jewish community in Ottawa, Barwin was head of the Canadian Fertility Society and had received the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal. Like Karbaat, he was first accused of chaotic record keeping, which led to women being given the wrong sperm. But in  it emerged he’d been using his own sperm. He’s currently being sued by a group of his biological children, and their legal mothers and fathers, his former patients.

And after so long in isolation, we all have our own idea of what we most want to do once le gets back to normal. So from cuddling grandkids to going to the footie or having your eyebrows waxed, here are a few of the things you are counting down to… James Millar , Antrim I can’t wait to see my Dad, my hero. He lives in assisted accommodation as he suffers end-stage  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and wet macular degeneration. It’s been really tough on Dad as he had to take even further steps during lockdown because of his health. He’s been down in the dumps and I can’t wait to give him a big hug and try to cheer him up! He’s been through so much these last four years and even having to give up our family home really got him down. Yet he never stops thinking of others! That’s my Pops through and through. He really is my absolute hero and I love him dearly! Here’s a photo of him and I messing about on Facetime recently. I would love to cheer him up by showing him his name in the Daily Mirror. Maggie Vasquez, Blackheath, South East London My eyebrows are crying out to be waxed! I go to work every day as a healthcare assistant at Queen Elizabeth Hospital but my eyebrows look like two slugs at the moment. I normally get them waxed two or three times a month. I can’t wait for the ‘brow bar’ to open back up! Halima, East LondonMy name is Halima and I am eight years old. This year I took part in the Clean Our Planet animation competition with Clean Planet Energy . I just found out that I am one of the lucky winners so I can’t wait for the lockdown to end so that I record my voiceover and meet the other five winners. It will be so much fun to see myself as a cartoon and as I like to teach people how to look after our planet. I am extra excited. Rob Wildey  Leanne Sharred Tamworth, Staffs We are looking forward to spending time with our family and friends, ing to St Andrew’s to watch our beloved Birmingham City. We were due to tie the knot... but moved it to next year. Leanne is a nursery nurse so she has been going to work as normal during this pandemic to care for children of key workers. She’s an inspiration. Colin White, Mansfield, Notts Can’t wait to get back to the over-s table in my bookmakers, where my mates and I put the world to rights, along with picking a few winners. Peter Berry-Paxton, Anerley, South East LondonI can’t wait to see my girlfriend Katrina again. We met on a dating website at the beginning of March. We met up within days and liked each other. I went to visit her at her house and since then we have been missing each other. We text every day and talk to each other on the phone every evening. We are so much in love, all we want is to be in each other’s arms again. Linda Troake, Kingswood, Bristol  I can’t wait to be together again with my -year-old mother, Edna Williams. Mum needs care  hours a day and my sister Carol and I used to share looking after her. But after lockdown Carol stayed with her in isolation and I haven’t been able to see her. I, with partner George, can only stand and wave to her or blow kisses outside her home. I also salute Carol for taking on this wonderful task without my help. I’m thankful we were able to celebrate her th birthday together on Valentine’s Day but I can’t wait to kiss and hug mum again. We will meet again x Susan Thrussell, Essendon, Herts  I can’t wait to cuddle my daughter and grandchildren. My daughter Louise and granddaughter Ally are home carers and because of their jobs I can’t see them, even though they live a mile away. I’m able to be with my son and his three children, who I’m living with, but not Louise and her three. I was only able to see them recently when I went to sing happy birthday to Louise. Kathleen Blackwood, Birkenhead, Merseyside  I can’t wait to cuddle my great-granddaughter Amelie Grace, who was born on April . I’ve seen photos every day but haven’t been able to hold her, even though she and her parents – my granddaughter Rachel and her husband Joe – live locally. My son, Amelie’s grandad, also lives with me. She is his first grandchild but he has only seen her from the front door. She’s five weeks old and we are missing out on holding and cuddling her. Brenda Guy, Telford, Shrops  I want cuddles from my five grandchildren, aged five to . Three of them live close by and I used to see my youngest, George, every week because I’d look after him after school. My husband Bryan is  and has Alzheimer’s, so we had to self-isolate, we’ve done eight weeks. Last week was my birthday but I didn’t get the usual cuddles. I can’t wait until it’s over so we can be together. Jeanette, Matt  Scarlett Palmer, Holmfirth, West Yorks  It may seem really sad but we can’t wait as a family to watch our football team again at home and away. We love Barnsley FC and one of our last memories was beating Fulham away in a fantastic match. This is my passion and I miss it so much.

A Government official said that as long as a two-metre distance is maintained, people can sunbathe or chat with one other person from a dferent household. This is good news for couples, friends and relatives who have stayed apart for almost two months.The new rules, which come into play from Wednesday, were initially unclear as Boris Johnson indicated in his speech that sunbathing could still only be done with members of the same household.He said: You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports, but only with members of your own household. But a Government official confirmed on Sunday evening that as long as they stay two metres apart, people will be allowed to sunbathe or chat with one other person from another household. Mr Johnson had previously warned people thatfriends outside of a household asked to meet up, they should refuse. In his address to the nation at the start of the lockdown on March , Mr Johnson said: You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.

The Prime Minister has dropped his stricter message as he unveiled his plans to ease the lockdown on Sunday evening alongside a fresh slogan - despite the latest UK death toll sitting at . Leaders of all the devolved nations have rejected his new advice amid criticism that the latest slogan is unclear. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has joined Scotlandaposs Nicola Sturgeon and Walesapos Mark Drakeford in distancing herself from Englandaposs approach to fighting the killer bugaposs spread. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Following Mr Johnsonaposs speech at the daily address to the nation, Mrs Foster said her region will not adopt the slogan, echoing the stances of her Scottish and Irish counterparts. The Stormont Executive will meet on Monday to consider its plan for a phased, strategic approach to recovery at its meeting ahead of outlining its own road map this week.It comes as Mr Johnson announced a conditional plan to reopen society as the coronavirus lockdown continues.This includes staff in certain non-essential sectors being encouraged to work, an ability to sunbathe in parks and a road map to the hospitality industry potentially opening up in July.  However, these remarks only apply to England as the devolved governments have control over which restrictions are in place. Mr Drakeford said the stay home message has not changed in Wales while Mrs Sturgeon said it is incumbent on the Prime Minister to clary that his easing of coronavirus restrictions only applies to England. Speaking to a BBC Scotland news special, she said: Itaposs just a statement of fact and of the law, that with the exception of Boris Johnsonaposs comments about border control, pretty much everything he said in his statement applied to England. My job is to take decisions based on the data for Scotland and my judgment now in the immediate term - that with the one exception I outlined today that people can now exercise outside as often as they want as long as they can comply by the social distancing rules - the way to suppress this virus now is to continue to stay at home, except for exercise, foods and medicine oryouaposre doing essential work that you canapost do from home.  Ms Sturgeon was also asked whether Mr Johnsonaposs referral to himself as the UK Prime Minister would make le dficult in letting the public know which restrictions remain in place in Scotland. She said: These restrictions are legally in place separately in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and therefore we have a duty to take decisions in our own jurisdictions about the speed at which we lt those. I think it is incumbent on him, perhaps a bit more strongly than he did tonight, to stress that when he is talking about lting these restrictions, he is talking for England. Ms Sturgeon also reinforced the stay at home message after the UK Government moved to a stay alert message. She said: We really all of us have such a duty right now to be as clear as possible and I think, having just watched the Prime Minister, I think there is perhaps still some room for just simpler, clearer messages.  It was also revealed by the First Minister that the R number - which is the rate of transmission - was between . and . Speaking earlier at the coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said she remained committed to working with the other nations of the UK on the virus. The First Minister said that the other nations of the UK should not be hearing about plans through the newspapers, referencing her discovery of the new messaging issued by the UK Government on Sunday. Reports surfaced on Saturday night that the slogan stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives would be dropped in favour of stay alert, control the virus, save lives. In a tweet on Sunday morning, the First Minister said she was made aware of the change through Sunday newspapers. She claimed a lack of consultation on messaging which could potentially be confused as being UK-wide made it harder to work together. Ms Sturgeon said: What does make a four nations approach more dficult to sustain isdecisions are being taken and, even inadvertently, being taken as UK decisions when they are not without proper consultation. Thataposs what I think is dficult and what I hope we will not see in the future, where we can get back to a position where weaposre sharing our thinking where evenweaposre doing things slightly dferently, we understand each otheraposs position and donapost end up inadvertently confusing each otheraposs messages. The First Minister asked the UK Government not to deploy the new messaging in Scotland, and told the briefing that the respective communications departments are currently in discussions. Similarly, speaking to BBC Northern Ireland radio on Sunday, Mrs Foster said: On the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time. It is important for people to know we are not doing this in a nanny state way. Once we can move, we will move.  While Northern Irelandaposs Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill said the decisions the Executive will take in the days and weeks ahead are some of the biggest we will ever have to make. She said: We know that six weeks into the restrictions, people need some light at the end of the tunnel. We also know that recovery will only happen one step at a time, to do otherwise risks undermining the sacrices people have already made and increases the risk of a second spike in the future. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has told Mr Johnson the new slogan is a nonsense. Prior to the PMaposs speech, he tweeted: Just spoke to @BorisJohnson about the address he will make tonight. I made it clear that his new aposStay Alertapos message is a nonsense. I also stressed the need for a cautious plan to move beyond full lockdown. That plan has to include a proper all Ireland testing and tracing system. Deputy Alliance Party leader Stephen Farry also criticised the new slogan. He tweeted: Just off a cross-party call with PM. Expressed our concerns with aposStay Alertapos message, both in terms of substance and mixing the message across UK.Also asked that future of economic measures reflects dferent circumstances across UK. Plus reinforced need for Brexit extension.Mrs Foster said there may be slight dferences to how the lockdown measures are eased across the UK, but warned that Northern Irelandaposs would be nuanced. Northern Irelandaposs reproductive rate- the number of people an infected person infects - is currently at .. Mrs Foster said that is higher than some areas in England and it needs to be driven down before the region can move to relax measures. Speaking on Skyaposs Sophy Ridge on Sunday, she said: We will be looking at some nuanced changes throughout that time and we will await to hear what the Prime Minister has to say today. But I think, in terms of the Northern Ireland public, it is important that we continue to protect them and make sure this virus does not start transmitting again in the community in a way that would cause damage to the community. Mrs Foster said the lockdown could be eased in dferent regions as Northern Irelandaposs rate of transmission is higher than other regions in the UK. Sage, and indeed our own chief medical officer, do indeed recognise that there are dferent rates of transmission across the United Kingdom, she said.  There are dferences across the UK, regional dferences I think the Prime Minister recognises those regional dferences and, as a result, you may see slight dferences across the UK. Askedit is a good idea that the lockdown could be re-applied to dferent regionsrequired, she said it is important that Northern Ireland moves in cohesion with the rest of the UK. It is important that we do what is right in our region of the United Kingdom moving forward. That is why we are coming with our road plan early next week.

With four bedrooms, and neatly painted walls, there seems to be nothing remarkable about the property. But step through the house and into the back garden and there is something truly amazing hiding behind the house. For owners Don and Ann Knight, their garden is their pride and joy and they have spent tens of thousands of pounds transforming it into something you would never normally expect to see in the heart of Wales. The stunning outside space requires hours of work and meticulous tending to keep it in tip top shape - but the results are definitely worth it. Don and Annaposs back garden is an Asian paradise and boasts a tranquil, five foot deep Koi pond, a Japanense Torri gate, a pagoda and even an Amazon waterfall. As well as their perfectly manicured lawns, there are also dozens of tiny bonsai trees, which have to be tended to daily.Ann, , told Wales Online : I met Don and he bought me the pagoda for my first Christmas present and it went from there.When I said you can do what you want to the garden I didnapost expect this. Gardening has long been a passion for Don, who loves nothing more than getting his green fingers dirty. He was just  when he first tried his hand at growing bonsai and has been fascinated with the tiny trees ever since. And keeping the beautul garden in Llantwit Manor in perfect condition is a full-time job for the couple. Grandmother-of-one Ann said: Heaposs always in the garden. If itaposs raining heaposs like a caged animal - he hates it. The bonsais need watering twice a day once it gets warmer and that takes about an hour each time. As heaposs doing that he will spot something  that needs trimming or doing. I thought he had finished and couldnapost do anything  and he watched Monty Don in Japan visiting the cherry blossom and then the autumn colours. He spotted something and proceeded to go out and buy these huge monolith stones for the garden. He also used the last part of the working garden for a zen area with white chipping. Thereaposs bamboo fencing across there to keep the dog off the white stuff. Thereaposs no more room to do anything  and I donapost want to give him ideas. Ann and Don are keen to use their garden for good and every summer they open it up for visitors to raise money for Marie Curie, Macmillan Cancer Support and Hospice UK  as part of the National Garden Scheme. One year, their pride and joy attracted a whopping  visitors in a single day, such is the fame of their garden. Ann, who worked in a bank before she retired, said: Weaposve quite a few private visitors, thereaposs been the bank pensioners, the WI, a koi club. One lady phoned up and askedshe could have her birthday party in our garden, she was . All the money they give us goes to Great Ormond Street Hospital. And while the couple are the brains behind the incredible project, theyaposve now roped their whole family in. All the beautul furniture is made by their son, Alan. And while Don is the one who works tirelessly on their back garden, Ann has made sure sheaposs put her own stamp on the land in front of their home.

Sally Berry worked tirelessly to transform the swampy ground that came with the home into a huge tranquil paradise. Her back garden had been used as a dumping ground for the former coal board and many would believe nothing would ever grow there again. But Sally, who spent seven years perfecting the stunning space, was certain it could be something truly special - and she was definitely right. Her devoted son, William, decided to buy his mum the patch of land, which is just yards from her back door when she suffered an accident. Sally was  when she went on a motorcycle holiday to Laos in south east Asia but ed with knee problems. Many would have looked at the two-acre patch of land in despair - but not Sally.William explained: Mum spent virtually every day down there, hacking balsam with a scythe, chopping brambles with a machete and digging paths with a mattock which is a type of shovel. After seven years of hard graft, the garden is an absolute success. I am amazed at how the land has transformed from a swamp into a paradise. It has been achieved by mum’s energy, experience and endless enthusiasm.It is now filled with wildflowers and plants native to Britain, which sit alongside tranquil streams and tumbling waterfalls. Interesting and unusual statues fills odd little nooks and crannies in the stunnin space, which has been named The Secret Garden.

Government insiders have told The Sun the elderly must continue to follow the exact same rules for the time being, in light of Boris Johnsonaposs new aposroadmapapos.The Prime Minister yesterday praised several sections of society for how they have responded to the torrid battle against the coronavirus pandemic.This included the fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can - however, other than that the PM shed little light on the way forward for over s.Prior to Mr Johnsonaposs address to the nation, the Government was gripped by a row over how over-s would be treated as restrictions begin to change.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. NHS guidance states that all those aged  or older, regardless of medical conditions — and those under  with an underlying health condition listed on its website — must remain shielded indoors. Campaigners have warned that forcing the elderly to remain detached from society while the rest of the nation starts toto normal is discriminatory. They added it risks sparking a mental health crisis among over-s.  Meanwhile, after almost two months of lockdown, the key points of the PMaposs so-called first sketch of a road map for reopening society were outlied. The first stated that a new Covid Alert System is being set up determined mainly by the reinfection rate and the number of cases. The alert levels will be one to five and the higher the level, the tougher social distancing measures will have to be. The PM said the UK had been in Level Four but we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to Level Three.  Also, from Monday, people who cannot work from home are being actively encouraged to go to work instead of being told to only gothey must. But they should avoid public transportat all possible.

For many, an increase of wind and rain may soften the blow of the UK coronavirus lockdown - which looks set to continue.Temperatures on Saturday peaked at .C in London, and remained widely into the s for many parts of the UK - causing many people to flock to parks. Police in the South East reported having had to move hundreds of people on from beaches. Sunday has seen maximum temperatures drop by around  degrees across the country, with a cloud front moving southwards - though some southern parts remained warm. The Met Office added that the UK would continue to see more cloud and wind in the coming week, but nothing signicant or unusual. Some parts of the UK can expect to see frostier mornings. While few people are expected to take up the chance to sunbathe from this Wednesday as lockdown restrictions ease, temperatures should start to rise as the summer approaches.  Part of springaposs charm is you can get both types of weather, a spokesman for the Met Office said. May can be quite a topsy-turvy month, getting closer to the start of summer. Itaposs not unusual for spring to have a hot part and a colder part. Theto duller weather comes following record-breaking April sunshine - with all four UK countries recording it among the top five sunniest since records in a series from .  In the final week of the month, rainfall totals increased in many places - but the UK overall still only received % of average April rainfall, according to official Met Office figures. UK  day weather forecast Today: Showers affecting parts of northern Scotland and eastern England, wintry in the northeast at first. Dry where with broken cloud and sunny spells. Strong winds making it feel cold in the south with gales along some coasts. Tonight: Winds easing in the south allowing a widespread frost under clear skies. Cloudier across Scotland with some showers moving southwards to affect Northern Ireland and northern England later.

They think it took nine hours for the insect to die before her body could reject the bug naturally. The creepy crawly flew into the childaposs left tear duct the previous afternoon, but her mum couldnapost see anything unusual apart from a red mark. SibiKaia woke up in floods of tears around .am claiming her eye was aposburningapos, so Kris, , checked her eye again and spotted a aposblack thingapos she thought was botfly eggs.She woke her husband Joseph, , up and they drove  minutes to their nearest hospital where SibiKaiaaposs eye started to produce pus - before the bug fell out at am.Kris, who lives in Laclede County, Missouri, US, said: By the time we got to the hospital she was calm and we were talking to the nurse. Then SibiKaia squeezed her eye shut and when she opened her eye it just slid out. The [registration] nurse was like aposOh my godapos and grabbed a tissue, and I was like aposoh my god, itaposs a bugapos. My reaction, the nurses reaction and the doctoraposs initial reaction was just this full-body shudder. The youngster took the gruesome discovery in her stride however and couldnapost wait to see what was hiding behind her eye, and even named it Todd straight away. Kris said: [SibiKaia] askedshe could see it, so I lowered it down to her and she just said aposHello, Toddapos, just cool and calm and then she walked away. Iaposm over here trying not to have a panic attack because a bug just came out of my daughteraposs face and sheaposs just like aposoh look, a bug. Letaposs go have ice creamapos.  Kris and Joseph are living with six of their seven children during lockdown, and the bug hit SibiKaia while the family were preparing a bonfire to celebrate their eldest sonaposs st birthday. The six-year-old mentioned her eye apostickled like an eyelashapos a number of times in the day, but it was only when she woke Kris up crying that the mum realised something was really wrong. Kris said: I got her to calm down and I lted her eyelid just a little bit and you could see this black thing. All I could think of was that a botfly had laid eggs in my kidaposs eye and the surgery she might need, and all of these things were going round my head.  I thought, aposokay, we need to go to hospitalapos, but I tried to stay calm for her. I didnapost want to freak out and have her freak out because she was already upset. On the way to the hospital we actually started singing songs on the radio to calm her down, and by the time weaposd got there sheaposd stopped crying. Only one person was allowed inside the hospital when they arrived, so Joseph stayed in their truck and Kris went in with SibiKaia where she faced the ’nightmare’ of seeing the bug fall from her daughter’s eye. Once the bug had fallen out, the doctor checked there was no damage to the childaposs eye and then told Kris the grisly details of what happened in a hospital corridor away from SibiKaia. The unfazed six-year-old had even started inviting staff to play aposI spy withapos, but she changed the words to aposI spy with my buggy eyeapos.

I think that’s why they took to him right away.“I am delighted for him, he’s still very fit and he’ll be looking to add to the games he has played for this football club.“I know he still believes there is a lot more football in Paul McGowan and I think he’s had another excellent season.”The duo arrived at Dens as players in the summer of  and became fast friends, driving up to Dundee from Glasgow every day.Now McGowan’s boss, McPake admits their relationship has changed somewhat from the days when he’d be on the receiving end of a regular verbal volley on the park.“If there were three people around him then he would still take the ball,” McPake added.“That’s brave –people talk about centre-backs being brave because they’ll put their head where it hurts but Paul McGowan is brave because he’ll take the ball in tight spaces and work something.“He very rarely loses the ball, gets you fouls and there is a respect from other teams to him. I’ve found that as a manager, the amount of times I heard ‘McGowan’s a good player’ from other managers last season.“He was great to play with, he would always take it – he could be a pain when you didn’t give him it and the game is going on up the pitch but he’s still standing trying to argue with you!“That’s Gowser. But there’s more than a screamer or a shouter – he encourages people, he helps people out and he’s honest. He’s the first to put his hand up when he believes he’s done something wrong and that’s gone in the modern game. He sets such high standards.“He’s a voice in the dressing-room as well. I’ve played with him but it’s a completely dferent relationship now.#I was his team-mate and his mate but now we don’t see much of each other apart from on the training ground. The dynamics have changed but I know exactly what I’ll get from him whenever he’s on the pitch.“There have been a few times when I’ve thought ‘I’m glad I’ve got Paul McGowan’. Evenhe’s not played you might think there will be a problem, not playing against United or Aberdeen, but he just accepts it and goes and trains.“There’s no sulking and is great to work with. He was great to play with because he’s such a quality footballer and I’m glad I have him at my disposal as a manager. He’s a leader for our club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"george-square-sauchiehall-street-seven-glasgow-landmarks-years","story":"WE love a throwback as much as anyone and what better way to get your fix than by seeing how our brilliant city has changed over the years."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

heated room, which was originally intended to replicate the climate of India.It first became popular in the early s as an exercise.The site is currently fitted out as a soft play area for children.Floor plans for the site show the first floor property will continue to be accessed via a staircase shared with nearby units.It would open into a waiting area and reception, alongside a breakout area with chairs and tables.There will be both male and female changing rooms with changing cubicles and benches, as well as a main hot yoga studio where classes would take place.Mats will be stored in the hallway area, and there will also be a scrub down area behind the reception, alongside male and female toilets and office space.A report by planners said: #The proposed used is

recovery of the industry which is suffering due to the pandemic.He said: #When restrictions ease, we want to be ready to welcome people back, but social distancing will be a massive challenge.#Things will almost certainly have toon an incremental basis and some sports won’t be feasible for the foreseeable future, such as team games, so what happens to those enthusiasts and the specialist facilities that we have in the city for certain sports #It is a concern, not just for Sport Aberdeen but other providers as well.He added: “We will need to take a lead from government and sports governing bodies, but we also need the support of our users.#We know that sport and physical activity are vital for so many of us, so now more than ever before, we need to ensure that the Government does what it can to help, through clear guidelines for recovery and support for this vital industry and the people who work within it.#A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: #We understand the importance of sport and physical activity and the desire from many to see them resume, but ensuring the rate of infection is kept as low as possible to protect the NHS and save lives is and will continue to be our priority.#This week, the Minister for Public Health, Sport and Wellbeing held a series of encouraging, constructive virtual meetings involving senior representatives from across the sporting sector to discuss how sport can resume when it is safe to do so – but it remains the case that any relaxation of measures must and will be guided by scientic evidence.#We are determined to help keep companies – including those involved in sport and physical activity – in business and are ensuring sporting organisations have access to all the support and advice which is available at this dficult time.#This is why sportscotland, our national agency for sport, has released £.m of funding early to support the sector deal with the impact of Covid-.#Similarly, across all businesses, we have offered a package of support worth £. billion which includes .% rates relief for all non-domestic properties in - and % relief for properties in retail, hospitality, leisure and airports.#For as

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This has led to some amazing acts of kindness on every street, in every village and town across the country. Communities have never felt stronger. Today, we shine a light on just some of the people from communities across the country to showcase examples of ordinary people doing extraordinarily kind and helpful things.CASE STUDYGAIL REDMONDCHARITY that supports families has noticed a sharp rise in requests for help due to widespread redundancies.Gail Redmond of Via Wings’ in the County Down town of Dromore, in Northern Ireland, says the charity normally gives out  food bags a month to people in need.“But last week we gave out  already, many of which are going to people who are self-isolating,” she said.“One guy who contacted me on Friday, said: I have never asked anyone for help like this before. But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two metre rule.”All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.This includes, paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards. He set a target of £ on his JustGiving page and has raised more than £ already.Leeds Cares is the official charity partner of Leeds Teaching Hospitals. The organisation supports NHS staff to deliver the best care for patients and their families, by raising funds for equipment, services, education and research.Leeds Cares works collaboratively with all of the hospitals across Leedsto identy charitable projects and causes.CASE STUDYSTENHOUSEMUIR FCHOME ADVANTAGE: Stenhousemuir players brought food directly to people’s houses.A FOOTBALL club initiative is supporting hundreds of families by delivering school meals to pupils during the coronavirus lockdown.With the season shut down indefinitely, Stenhousemuir FC set up its community help hotline in mid-March to assist the most vulnerable members of society as the effects of the global pandemic began to take hold.A -strong squad of volunteers was assembled in the first week to carry out everyday tasks like shopping or dog walking for those in isolation or for whom such activities would prove dficult. Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful. Section  claims will be considered on a case-by-case basis."},{"url":null,"title":"5g-mast-proposed-galashiels-council-land","story":"PLANS for a G mast in Galashiels have been lodged with Scottish Borders Council .The applicationwould see the .-metresteel pole placed on the verge of the townrsquos King Street, on land owned by the council.Residents are now able to submit their views on the proposal, put forward by Harlequin Group on behalf of EE Ltd.Galashielscouncillor Euan Jardine said: \"I believe it is important for our local economy that we are on level terms with other towns throughout the country in regards to G provision.\"It will also have some positive aspects for recreational usage and help to usher in advancements in technology that will change a lot of how we go about our daily lives.\"Mr Jardine added that he had not been approached by any residents about the application.Meanwhile, his ward colleagueHarry Scott told the Border he was not aware of the plans.Mr Scott said: \"I would need to study the application and the circumstances around it before coming to any conclusions.\"The application, ref   C, can be viewed on the council website."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-homes-can-book-virtual-visit-auctioneer-bonhams","story":"BORDERS residents have the chance to invite a world-famous auctioneer to look round their homes this week.Bonhams is delivering a free valuation service through video conferencing apps.And this week, households in the Borders are under the spotlight, with residents being asked to dig out paintings, jewellery, furniture and collectables.Bonhams Scotland managing director Charles Graham-Campbell said: \"Wersquore trying to adapt and do these valuations in a way thatrsquos safe for everybody.Appointments are available from Tuesday until Thursday , am to pm.Items that can be assessed include paintings, silver, jewellery, ceramics, glass, clocks, works of art, furniture, Asian items, and collectables such as whisky.Mr Graham-Campbell, , said: ldquoWersquove always provided valuations where people have sent in photographs but we havenrsquot actually done a Zoom, Teams or WhatsApp virtual meeting ndash a video going round a house looking at objects.ldquoSo this is something new, itrsquos the antique world adapting to the situation we currently find ourselves in.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

This, he suggested, will last for many years. Several health professionals have told me that the long-term psychological damage of coronavirus on iniduals and families is what you might associate with surviving a war. Anyone who thinks wersquoll be meeting lsquonormalityrsquo any time soon is deluding himself.Schools, especially those with a high quotient of disadvantaged pupils, will be required to provide a full suite of social services. To an extent, this had always been part of their duty of care. In the years ahead though, this will become their primary . At this stage we canrsquot easily put a figure on the number of children affected by parents losing their jobs or struggling with overwhelming debt. The word lsquounprecedentedrsquo is now the most common in the pandemic lexicon and it fits here too. And we can only guess at what other iniquities many children will have been forced to witness.Itrsquos almost unbearable to imagine what terrors many women and children are currently experiencing. Last week, Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of domestic abuse charity, Nia, reported that domestic violence killings have more than doubled during the lockdown. Ms Ingala Smith has been monitoring the numbers of women killed by men in the UK for an annual femicide census and has identied at least  suspected domestic abuse killings occurring between March  and April .Ms Ingala Smith said the number of women killed by men in the first three weeks of lockdown is the highest for  years. We also know the communities in which this apocalypse is most prevalent. According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos latest statistics, these places are seeing coronavirus death rates three times worse than in affluent neighbourhoods.After lockdown, as society hurries to re-locate order, the money-changers will be found at the head of the throng. Yet,the countrys primary focus is on the recovery of its people then corporations and commerce police and judiciary must also be encouraged to change dramatically the way they go about their business. To borrow another locution from the coronavirus glossary, this should happen in lsquolocksteprsquo with the programme of welfare that will be requiredwe are serious about the post-pandemic recovery.Weve all warmed to the acts of kindness and compassion which have made the lockdown more bearable. The true worth of our claims to be a lsquodecentrsquo country fit for heroes will lie in how our civic authorities and our corporate giants treat people.The Government was very quick to create emergency legislation to provide an aid package to preserve jobs. Something similar must be enacted to ensure large companies with big profits dont hide behind coronavirus to dispense with their workers. This perhaps will be an early test of Keir Starmerrsquos credentials to lead the Labour Party. Following the  banking crisis countless large companies treated their employees as mere collateral damage. It didnrsquot matter that their huge profits would soon recover in time in the short term the ravenous demands of their shareholders had to prevail.Greenock and Stockbridge: A tale of two Scotlands under coronavirusThe Royal Bank of Scotlandwas considered by the UK Government to be too big to fail and public cash was found to save it. It repaid the nationrsquos largesse by establishing its Global Restructuring Group to locate and hunt down small and medium-sized businesses menace them into liquidation and then gorge themselves on the assets for a song. It was a scandal.In pre-coronavirus times large firms who felt pressured into morality would blackmail the country by warning us thattoo many regulations and controls were imposed on them theyd have to up sticks and relocate where. Aye, well good luck to themthey attempt to pull that one now...In times of crisis we are all urged to pull together and channel our inner Dunkirk. We all fall in quickly. It soon emerges, though, that the new rules rarely apply to the corporate world. In the US those banks tasked with disbursing cash intended to relieve small businesses chose instead to favour their large corporate clients. The relief programme was intended to give emergency loans to firms as an inducement to businesses not to ditch their employees. It ran out of money last week because the larger firms were served first. More than  of these firms, some with market values of more than  million, received a combined million in loans.We saw something of this last month in the UK as multi-million-pound firms with massive profits moved with remarkable haste to avail themselves of the Government furlough scheme. This money tree canrsquot maintain such windfalls indefinitely. A time will come when the Government must move to protect the employees when the directors revert to their base instincts.We too easily swallow the pernicious fiction of capital that entrepreneurs are our sole wealth-providers. In this wersquore told that they live to provide jobs from the wells of goodness that spring in their saintly hearts. Aye, right. The reality is thatmany of them could find a way of amassing profits without having to use workers at all theyrsquod regard it as the golden ticket.In the years ahead we will be urged to alter our behaviours and to get with the new reality. This must apply to the corporations too. They must be made to assist in the national recovery programme by putting people at the heart of their enterprises before profits.

Almost everyone abides by the coronavirus code, which carries an echo of the police speed awareness course I was once obliged to attend. ldquoOnly a fool ignores the two second rule,\" went the jingle for keeping your distance from the vehicle in front. Breaking the new rules could be even more hazardous.Everyone extols the virtues of regular walking, and to judge by peoplersquos faces and mood, itrsquos doing us good. Therersquos nothing like having your liberty taken to encourage you to get outdoors while you can. A favourite walk follows an old drove road, along which herders would drive their beasts to market, either locally or in the north of England. Wide, and partially cobbled, this route allows you to get into a stride, while scanning trees and sky, or field upon field of horses and their winter foals.A drove road like this could be as old as the village, or even older. Hoolet was officially granted permission to hold a market in the early s, so itrsquos possible that from miles around people traded their animals to and from here along tracks such as this. One of the commonest books yoursquoll find in second-hand book shops is A R B Haldanersquos The Drove Roads of Scotland.Regrettably I have lost my fatherrsquos copy, but have a sellotaped edition of my husbandrsquos. First published in , it looks off-puttingly dry and yet it offers a riveting insight into a way of le so long gone as to feel mythical. By way of research, Haldane spoke to shepherds, farmers, crofters and factors to mine them for local knowledge. The result is a testament to the part livestock and their keepers have played in our history.A colourful passage from a Victorian onlooker describes a livestock ldquotryst at Stenhousemuir, where around , sheep and tens of thousands of cattle were gathered. He writes of the tar pots used to mark sold beasts, the cacophony of cattle dealers, drovers, pedlars, gamblers, ballad singers and beggars, and of servants ldquorunning about shouting to the cattle, keeping them together in their particular lots and ever and anon cudgels are at work upon the horns and rumps of the restless animals that attempt to wander in search of grass or water. Such a welter of beasts recalls the great buffalo herds in the American mid-west, and the drama, and danger, of keeping them under control.Did such a multitude of hooves ever thunder past the village  The old track is so tranquil, despite the orchestration of birds, itrsquos hard to imagine its former use. But I find that is the case with almost everything about country le. Books, newspapers and documentaries constantly inform us about tempting rural walks we can take for our health and pleasure, and walking during lockdown has enjoyed a resurgence in the same way as biking. Yet well into the th century people from a hamlet like ours, and all across the country, walked for miles every day: not as a hobby or to keep fit, but because it was their only means of transport.The picturesque village of Denholm, not far away, is the birthplace of the famous linguist John Leyden. As a young man he once walked  miles in a day, just to record the final verses of a song to add to Sir Walter Scottrsquos compendium of border ballads. The shepherd James Hogg would think nothing of crossing the hills of an evening from the Ettrick valley to Tibbie Shielsrsquo Inn by St Maryrsquos Loch, to carouse with friends. Itrsquos a round trip of over  miles. When his household needed provisions from Selkirk, the nearest town, that would entail another -mile jaunt. Presumably a mule or pony was used for such a distance  But even for the four-legged, that is quite a schlepp.Another legendary walker was Thomas de Quincey, a forerunner of the redoubtable Captain Tom Moore. In the s he planned to cure himself of his ldquoopium misery by walking himself fit, but at this precise moment his legs failed him. His doctorrsquos warnings were dire and, fearing thathe didnrsquot cure himself he would be disabled for the rest of his le, he took to the garden of his cottage near Lasswade. Measuring its perimeter, he estimated  laps came to a mile. Starting out cautiously, he gradually grew stronger. Soon he was doing  or  miles a day until, he wrote, ldquoI had within ninety days walked  miles\". While he lived here, his medical student lodger trudged seven miles to Edinburgh University and back every day, so commonplace an occurrence it was barely worth remarking on.Itrsquos easy to look back on the great distances country folk covered with pity as well as awe, but as any serious walker knows, few things are more enjoyable ndash in decent weather ndash than clocking up the miles. There are moments when you feel like a piece of machinery, the cogs and wheels working in unison. Itrsquos also a failsafe way of clearing the mind, and finding fresh inspiration. Whenever my husband is stuck for the next sentence, he heads out. The top of every article or chapter he writes should record the tally of miles walked between first word and last.Itrsquos no wonder so many writers have been walkers. Not all were obliged to tramp the hills and roadside every day but many, like Robert Louis Stevenson, recognised the therapeutic benefits. He didnrsquot want to scale the heights, or keep to a strict and demanding schedule. A steady pace was his aim because, ldquoonce you have fallen into an equable stride, it requires no conscious thought from you to keep it up, yet it prevents you from thinking earnestly of anything ..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-enjoy-cairngorms-comfort-armchair","story":"The hotels, bars and restaurants are quiet, the visitors are at home.

Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember.ldquoSome show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location.Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff. The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued.The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever.Last year alone, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around .Mackiersquos collection comprises field notes, photographs, drawings and ious research material collected during investigations of threatened sites including East Wemyss Caves and the Greenland, Auchentorlie prehistoric rock sculptures.Much of the collection derives from his s excavation and survey of brochs and duns, notably Dun Mor Vaul in Tiree, Dun Lagaidh, and Dun an Ruigh Ruadh in Lochbroom.Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ferguson added: ldquoThese archives give a unique perspective on civic planning in the th century including the development and growth of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while the images of excavations showcase the sites that helped archaeologists unlock the secrets of Scotlandrsquos past ndash from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages.ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

Other countries are doing it in four hours.:Scotland nowhere near prepared enough to handle mass vaccination against Covid-, expert warnsIn his latest observations to ministers, Mr Pennington says it has been \"well known for many years\" that care homes provide an environment which facilitates the spread of a range of microbial pathogens and that \"frequent and repeated testing\" of those going into them \"is the only preventive measure that will be signicantly effective\".Concerns have also been raised about the ability to test frontline workers in Scotland during the Covid- crisis.The Scottish Government is reviewing its Covid- testing strategy after the Deputy First Minster John Swinney was left ldquofrustrated by reports home care workers had been told to travel to the other side of Scotland for tests.Nicola Sturgeon said that by Friday, the NHS capacity to test was to rise to -a-day ndash meaning Scotland would have the ability to carry out , tests a day ndash on top of the UK-organised drive-throughs.On April , the First Minister set out an aim to \"proportionately\" match with % of the ,-tests-a-day pledge by the UK health secretary Matt Hancock. Data shows that both the Scotland and the rest of the UK have been failing to meet that aim in the past week.The Scottish Government had been preparing to have the ability to test ndash referred to officially as \"capacity\" ndash in Scotlands laboratories to rise to more than , daily by the end of the month.On May , the First Minister said the ability to test had actually exceeded that and had risen to  tests a day with NHS laboratories operating in all health board areas, without relying on the Lighthouse lab.She announced testing in care homes in Scotland will include testing of all residents and staff ndash whether or not they have the virus ndash in homes where there has been a confirmed case.But she admitted: \"Laboratory capacity is one thing, what matters is the volume of testing we do and the clinical objectives we set for testing.\"Herald on Sunday analysis of Scotlands new way of reporting of testing launched on May  reveals that Scotland has been consistently lagging way behind the rest of the UK in terms of its per-capita testing rate.On Friday alone Scotland was completing  tests per million of population - % less than the  per million of population for the whole of the UK.Official Scottish Government figures show that  tests were carried out on Friday, with a further , completed at regional drive-through centres organised by the UK government, which provides extra capacity for checks. The  tests carried out was a drop of  on the previous  hours and  less than the weeks peak of , on the day the First Minister announced the new testing aims.Testing for coronavirus is seen as a crucial factor to easing out of lockdown ndash allowing the country to effectively isolate cases and their contacts to contain any spread.Both the UK and Scottish governments have been coming under fire for unpreparedness and a failure in mass testing in the current coronavirus pandemic.Mr Pennington emphasised the importance of wider testing in his latest observations.He said: \"Mass community testing will be needed to identy infectious but asymptomatic iniduals as part of the contact tracing process. When new case numbers have signicantly declined and when it is evident that the decline is being sustained for several days, it should be possible to start contact tracing to hunt down the virus.\"Professor Bauld echoed the need for community testing in evidence given to MSPs last week.\"We look like we are getting it right on hospitals... we have limited information from high-risk settings so thats care homes and other settings where you have vulnerable populations who particularly urgently need tested and staff need testing. As far as I am aware we dont have data, and have not yet got the capacity in primary care and out-of-hours settings,\" she said.:Ian Blackford hits out at familys -mile holiday to Motherwell as Scots poke fun at bizarre trip\"If we are going to have a mass testing programme, which we need to do for test, trace,isolate, we need real time data from those settings so we can figure out what is going on. My understanding is Wales are a step ahead of us in time of these real time data issues.\"Sir Harry Burns, the former Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, meanwhile, warned that we have \"a long way to go on test, trace and isolate at this time\" ndash pointing to worries about the quality of tests as well as the number.He pointed to South Korea as an example of a country which is \"far more aggressive\" in terms of identying people who might spread it adding: \"And thats why the testing is important.\"South Korea has suffered just  coronvirus fatalities from a population of . million while Scotland has seven times that death toll with about a tenth of the people.\"Test people to see who is capable of spreading it, trace the contacts and isolate all their contacts, as well as them,\" he said. \"That is the way in which you control any infectious disease.\"He added: \"We should be testing the whole population. We need to know how widespread the virus is in the population, once you know that, you know who might still be out there that might be infected.\"We need to be looking at the folk capable of spreading it and those are predominantly health and care workers, and we need to be testing them on a regular basis.\"The Scottish Government said it was signicantly scaling up its testing capacity.A spokesman said \"We now have overall NHS lab capacity of , tests a day.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally. Thus, as stated in HMS Aylmer’s Report of Proceedings:once the last Loch Eriboll U-boats had been processed, and in his fortnightly diary of events dated  May , the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Greenock, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Hill, reported to the C-in-C WA that:In summary, for two weeks in May , Loch Alsh was a centre of U-boat-related activity. It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead. However, even after the arrival of  EG, its berthing and mooring facilities were inadequate for handling the ex-Loch Eriboll U-boats at the required speed. moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal, both of which were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each could accommodate the disembarking German crews and each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats.They were therefore pressed into service, and between  May and  May facilitated  EG’s processing of the U-boats.In that short time  of the U-boats were escorted to Lisahally and one to Liverpool,  torpedoes were removed and disposed of,  German crew members were searched, and , of them were landed for transfer to POW Camps.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh a bhaintighearna","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.A bheil sibh eòlach air Gleann Eireachd ann an Siorrachd Pheairt  Tha Uisge Eireachd a’ sruthadh troimhe – sin an abhainn a tha a’ dol tro Bhlàr Ghobharaidh.Tha e air creag os cionn na h-aibhne., seo na chanas an t-Suirbhidh Òrdanais anns an Leabhar Ainmean aca: ‘Aig oir a’ bhearraidh, chithear fhathast tobhta tùir # air a bheil Caisteal na Baintighearna Liondsaidh, anns an robh o chionn nan ceudan bhliadhnaichean, nighean a bhuineadh don chinneadh uasal Crawford air a glasadh a-staigh fad a beatha mar thoradh air breith a’ Phàip #’ Agus dè rinn i – a’ Bhaintighearna Liondsaidh a bha seo Seo agaibh an sgeulachd. Timcheall na bliadhna ceithir cheud deug, ochdad ʼs a naoi , bha dithis bhràithrean còmhla ann an caisteal ann an Srath Àrdail. B’ iad Alasdair Liondsaidh, am mac a bu shine aig a’ cheann-chinnidh – Iarla Chrawford – agus a bhràthair, Iain.Chaidh na bràithrean a-mach air a chèile gu dubh. Thog iad buill-airm an aghaidh a chèile. Bha Alasdair air a leòn. Bha e na laighe san leabaidh an dèidh làimhe, feuch faighinn seachad air call fala, nuair a chuir a bhean cluasag air aodann airson a mhùchadh. Mura b’ e sin, bha daoine dhen bheachd gun robh e air tighinn beò.B’ i a bhean Seònaid Ghòrdan, nighean aig Seòras, Iarla Hunndaidh, agus a bhean Annabella, nighean aig Rìgh Seumas I. Cho luath ʼs a bha Alasdair Liondsaidh a-mach às an rathad, phòs Seònaid Pàdraig, mac aig Iarla Grey.Cha robh esan beò fada, ged nach urrainn dhomh a ràdh an do chuir a bhean cluasag an sàs na aghaidh.

of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere’s only so much looking at a blank page on screen that’s possible before you have to admitdefeat.In the absence of any golf, indeed any sports at all, and with a pledge to try not to add to the news and commentary around the Covid- crisis already made sometimes it’s very much a case of panic.So I decided to head off around the world.It’s easy.Even with nothing much flying, huge restrictions on general travel, and ‘lockdown’ still very much in evidence it’s still possible with a bit of imagination.Lots of things are.‘Around the World in  Trains’ by Monisha Rajesh is the kind of adventure that most of us probably, deep down, only dream about.The notion of giving everything up and heading off on a , mile journey by train, most of the time certainly not travelling first-class, with only the confidence of your publisher behind you, might terry most.The dference here being that Rajesh has a ‘track’ record hereand already had managed ‘Around India in  Trains’ to considerable acclaim.The ‘gamble’ wasn’t so much that everything hinged on the possibility of a book-deal, that the house might have to be sold to pay for the trip, or that anything could go possibly wrong: this was the sort of adventure that comes with the kind of safety net that wannabe travel writers might only care to dream about.The ‘gamble’ was a sure thing.The best kind.She loves train travel.She knows she already possesses a charming style and wit .She is fearless, adventurous, resourceful and confident.She probably had the advance in the bank and a Bloomsbury credit card tucked away somewhere safe.She took her fiancé to sell for body parts, just in case.The bases were covered.But it didn’t feel like that and, despite being incredibly jealous, you easily get sucked into her world of ‘roughing it’ amongst strange farts, loud snores, despicable train ‘etiquette’, and uncomfortable travel bedfellows, depending on which rails you are traversing.These strange times provide a unique opportunity for those of us who, luckily, can get lost inside their own heads.Days of reading and Netflix, YouTube documentaries and Sky box sets can keep the madness at bay whilst you head into the sixth straight week of nightsht.That and doing the lottery.You can disappear, both into your own and somebody ’s fantasy adventures, safe in the knowledge that you will never have the cojones to even challenge yourself to anything more dangerous than a co-op ‘seafood selection’ a couple of days beyond its ‘best before’ date, nor less basic than a -star hotel in exotic, far-flung, hot-spots like Cyprus or Tenere .I find myself vicariously earthy and ‘real’ eating a ‘three squeaks’ aperit after haggling with a one-legged hawker on a street corner, before hitting the hay for the fth consecutive night with a fellow traveller who now smells sweetly ripe, despite washing his feet where I shave.I’m adventurous, but only in my own head.I can yearn for the real, authentic, deal, but would probably settle for a ‘Westworld’ or ‘Total Recall’ futuristic implant.I could pack it in and head for the opal depletedmines of Coober Pedy, or the aptly named Opalton in Australia.Following in the footsteps, and bore holes, of prospectors who either struck it rich or went broke trying I’m there with the jack-hammer, just praying for a glint of green.Sold the Mondeo and the golf clubs, bought my claim and a second-hand excavator, and will surely strike it rich where every other damned fool either failed or moved on.Claiming a redundant, abandoned, dangerous, tunnel to the centre of the earth is the stuff of the original ‘ers.Except they’d have got there first.I’d make a great Outback Opal Hunter: I’ve got the Drizabone hat, with corks, and am getting used to working in the dark with headlights.Maybe I’ll start digging around in the shed and see what I could find to take to auction.Become a Pawnstar or Auction Hunter, rather than just ‘flogging it’, whatever ‘it’ turns out to be, for a £.I’ll head to Vegas, spin Chumlee a great line about my cousin Donald, and cash in on the great-great-grandmother.Memo to self: check the lineage and silence Bill Lawson.Ach, I might even disappear up to Dutch Harbour for a while and see what the fishing’s like with my old pal, Sig Hansen on the ‘Northwestern’.The Barents Sea looks like a doddle compared to Broad Bay, although the weather might require an extra pair of Damart.I might watch Ricky Gervais’ ‘After Le’ again the first time was a bit ‘misty’ in parts.I recommend it to you.In between I’ll do the odd lottery, online naturally, just to add to the suspense when I get ‘lucky’.Lucky is a relative term.The ‘congratulations, you have a winning ticket’ email is one of the tricks le likes to play on us all in its huge panoply of crushing disappointments, dressed up full of promise.I like to leave it a while before checking, spending the £ million carefully, ensuring the family are sorted before I buy my own train.The accumulated £. may require pooling.I won’t let any win ruin my positive, cheerful, disposition.When it comes to big numbers, the latest book, Matt Parker’s ‘Humble Pi’ doesn’t take long to leave you whistling at how unprepared you were to comprehend something as ‘small’ as a trillion.He was asked once to go onto tv to explain when the UK national debt crept up to this figure.Can#t be far past a billion, right Wrong!He explained it thus.A million seconds is nearly  days.A billion seconds is nearly  years.Ok, so now you’re in the ‘ballpark’, aren’t you Nah.A trillion seconds would take us all to the year .Yup,  years into the future.So how long to the end of the lockdown and ‘things’ get back to what’s being called the ‘new normal’ As long as it takes to guarantee the safety of each and every one of us, especially the most vulnerable, should be the answer, but these are strange times.Don’t count the seconds.Count the sunny days and savour each and every one of them.And yes, I know it’s probably snowing this weekend.It’s peat-cutting season.I wasn’t going to mention the coronavirus crisis, but unfortunately it’s caught up with us in a very real and devastating way.No amount of books, tv and fantasy can hide us from harsh reality.It’s nice to digress, but my thoughts are with the families affected in Skye.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may

We also reached out to our friends in Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William Flute Band and were delighted to be able to work with them to distribute over  care packages to some of the most vulnerable members of our community.Obviously thanks must go to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council for providing the grant and for the extremely fast turnaround throughout the application process, the club would also like to thank Maurice Cooper and the Ballee Discount Shop for helping us source the products. Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

They include Cara Doranfrom north Belfast, who for the past six years has been a receptionist at Belfast#s Merchant Hotel, a casualty of the Covid- crisis and now closed along with countless other bars and restaurants.With no idea when she will be back behind her desk in the lobby, Cara was keen to use her free time to make a dference through volunteering.Now for six days a week she is one of the #soup-er heroes# making deliveries throughout the greater Shankill area to the most vulnerable, elderly and those in need.On a typical day Cara packs her car full of deliveries before heading to around  homes, where people of all ages are isolating from the virus.After a few days of being at home when the hotel closed I just knew that I had to do something during this pandemic, Cara said.With all this free time on my hands, I couldn#t just sit about not helping out people in need. I saw an advert on Facebook that the Spectrum Centre were seeking drivers for soup deliveries and got in touch.It#s contact-free work where I deliver the soup and leave it outside the homes, rap the door and then walk away.Cara says the work has been really fulfilling.Everyone is friendly and very appreciative. Some are quite lonely and do like to have a chat, which is fine, and I do.From a mental health point of view, doing this is a great help as it gets you motivated to get up and go out.If I can help out in any way when this is all over, I will stay involved with the centre, Cara added.Meanwhile, Joan Murphyis four weeks into her stint delivering soup with the same group, having been furloughed from her job at the Movie House Cinema at Yorkgate, where she has worked for  years.I locked the cinema doors for the last time on St Patrick#s Day and it was a really weird feeling not knowing when the projectors would be back on again, Joan said.After two weeks of pacing the floor I knew that I needed to be doing something and started following some community pages on social media who needed drivers for delivery.Giving up a few hours for three days each week really isn#t that much, but you get to know those you meet on the run and your fellow volunteers.I#m loving being a part of this as I#m getting a lot out of it and it gives your week some structure too. Plus I#m getting to know parts of Belfast I had never been to before.Tens of thousands of food packages are also being delivered to those who are shielding, the financially vulnerable or people who may be experiencing dficulties physically accessing food.Numerous local voluntary groups are involved, including Cregagh Community Association in east Belfast, and it#s where Joanne Snoddenhelps to deliver  food and essential items parcels every Friday.The mum-of-two was a children#s play worker with Venture Kids after school club and was keen to help others in whatever way she could.It gives me a reason to get up, dressed and get out there, Joanne explained.We put the parcels together in Mount Merrion Church and then normally ide the runs up so you take about six each.Last Friday when I dropped off a parcel with one wee man he just burst into tears he was so happy.My daughter was in the car at the time and she asked me why he was crying, so I had to explain it was because he was thankful as he can#t get out himself.This has also been a chance for her to learn the importance of helping others.Elsewhere Maura O#Brienfrom Glengormley was previously an administrator with a construction firm for over three years before being furloughed on April .Now she is using her free time to do shopping for an elderly couple who are self-isolating after registering with the Volunteer Now website.It#s a chance to give something back because initially I felt a sense of guilt that I was still being paid to do nothing whilst others are working hard on the front line, Maura said.I phone the couple every week, get their order for groceries the next day, do the shopping and then leave it on their porch.At this stage I know their shopping list better than my own.They are a lovely couple and you could easily sit and talk to them all day on the phone.I#m glad to be doing this as I can#t get to see my own parents back in Co Tyrone at the moment.You#d love to be able to do more but every little helps.I#d urge anyone considering doing something to help others so just get out there and do it, she added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tomorrow marks both International Nurses Day and the th anniversary of Nightingale#s birth. Her image and a message of thanks will be projected from Parliament on to her place of work, St Thomas# Hospital, while similar projections will happen at the British Embassy in Rome and the Italian Federation of Nurses. Thousands of former nurses have come out of retirement to help the health service deal with the coronavirus outbreak and thousands of students are also helping by working in extended clinical placements.Health Minister Robin Swann said: International Nurses Day is particularly important this year not only because it is the th anniversary of Florence Nightingale#s birth, but because of the exceptional work of nurses in our response to coronavirus.I want to thank each and every one of our incredible nurses who are on the front line in the battle against the greatest public health crisis of our time.I know how much the public#s support and the clapping that has been ringing out from doorsteps every Thursday has buoyed our health and social care workers. It would mean a great dealpeople once again showed their gratitude by shining a light for nurses this Tuesday.First Minister Arlene Foster said: How fitting it is that  has been designated the Year of the Nurse and Midwe, because this is the year that we will remember the enormous contribution of our nurses and healthcare staff in the fight against Coronavirus.Florence Nightingale#s dedication, skill and transformative care of patients is synonymous with the values and expertise so evident in the modern day nursing profession in Northern Ireland.This Tuesday, on International Nurses Day, let us recognise their incredible dedication, their professionalism, and their enormous personal sacrice for the good of us all.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said: Our nurses are a shining light. While this emergency situation has brought their contribution to the fore, we must recognise the importance of their role in caring for us, and our families, throughout our lives.When we come out the other side of this crisis, one of the positives we can take from it is ensuring that our nurses and other health and social care staff get the recognition they deserve.A range of local landmarks, monuments and council buildings will be illuminated blue, the colour of the nurse, tomorrow evening.Professor Greta Westwood, CEO of the Florence Nightingale Foundation, said: Florence Nightingale, herself a trailblazer during her career, would have been proud at the way nurses have followed in her footsteps as pioneers and leaders in the fight against the pandemic.

Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, chairman of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, criticised the government#s daily briefings, saying that, while members of the public are hungry for genuine information, they are being fed number theatre.In an interview with the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show, Sir David said he wished data was being presented by people who know its strengths and limitations and could treat the audience with respect.The eminent statistician added that it is extraordinary that it is not known how many people have had Covid-.In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has been strongly criticised by the UK Statistics Authority over gaps and losses in the reporting of coronavirus figures.The department has also been under growing pressure to release information about the true scale of the Covid- crisis in our care homes.Asked about the government#s communication to the public about coronavirus through its daily televised briefings, Sir David said he watched Saturday#s, adding frankly, I found it completely embarrassing.We get told lots of big numbers, precise numbers of tests being done - ,. Well, that#s not how many were done yesterday it includes tests posted out.We#re told , people have died no, they haven#t, it#s far more than that.I think this is actually not the trustworthy communication of statistics. It#s such a missed opportunity. The public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they#re hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information, and yet they get fed this what I call #number theatre#, which seems to be co-ordinated really much more by a Number  communications team rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what#s going on.I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strengths and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.Sir David also raised concerns about a lack of information on how many people have had the virus.He told the programme that some say the infection fatality rate - the proportion of people infected with the virus who go on to die - is around %.Putting the number of deaths at around ,,this is multiplied up, it would mean that around . million people have been infected.But others put the infection fatality rate at a dferent percentage, with some saying the infection fatality rate is half of one percent, which would mean that seven million have been infected, while others claim half the country has been infected, he said.Asked by Marr how scared we should be of Covid-, Sir David said it is very important that we are aware of what the risks are.I#m not saying how anybody should feel, or what they should be worried about, but my aim, as a statistician, was that people#s anxiety should be at least roughly proportional to the actual risks that they face, he said.As an example, Sir David said there are  million children under the age of  in England and Wales, and, up to April , there had been two deaths in this age group.This is the tiniest risk you could think of, so I do think that when people start talking about protecting our children, this is a bit of a delusion, he said.Obviously, I#m talking about risks to the inidual themselves, we have to think about the potential for spreading the virus, and that#s absolutely vital.But when we talk about personal risk, for young people, it#s staggeringly low.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Peter Marley has been using the restrictions on movement to work on a series of portraits.#Sociable Distance# is the working title of his special project, an ongoing series of photographs captured during the Covid- pandemic.He explained how he has been using his daily walk to make images that create a time capsule of this unusual period in which we find ourselves.I#ve been making portraits with friends, neighbours and strangers, all from a responsible distance, he said.And it has been a great way to stay connected to a community whilst documenting the much quieter streets of Belfast.Peter , from Glenarf, Co Antrim, is married to -year-old Zjena, a costume designer who is originally from Croatia. They are expecting their first child.He normally works in the TV and film industry, but as that has come to global standstill he has turned his hand to this innovative challenge.To date his series comprises around  pieces and has gained momentum over the last few weeks as people have started to learn of his unique project.But although he suggested that he may hit , he stressed that he never really works with a target in mind, adding: That adds more pressure to how I work and makes it more goal-orientated as opposed to being an organic process.Peter said: I respond to people getting in touch with me but I also chat to neighbours and strangers to give the project a little spontaneity.It allows me to meet people who aren#t in my immediate friend circle or extended neighbour group.A few would also be the unemployed film community, it#s almost like checking in on them, just to have a chat, and then quite a few of them would be strangers who got in touch with me after exposure of the project online, or strangers I found in their garden enjoying the sun or at the doorstep.Having worked on portrait projects before, Peter said the idea for this one came from him checking in on friends who where nearby but hadn#t really had anyone to chat with.I#ve done similar things to document changes going on around the country or strange events whenever they pop up, he said.So this was almost to create a time capsule for something that doesn#t happen too often where people are instantly changing their day to day habits.Everything like shopping has gone from a daily convenience to a weekly extravagance.People have been very responsive and very quick to change their habits, from getting coffee on the street to preparing at home. Even thought the portraits were a way of making sure friends and family were okay, it was also a way of documenting how quickly our local community had changed.Hopefully that will be a record for .Perhaps the most striking thing for Peter has been the positivity of the people he has encountered on the way.There is an undercurrent of concern and worry but beyond that people are generally looking out for each other, he said.Some are running errands for their older neighbours. There#s a real compassion within the community.It#s warm and fantastic to see. If I had been told to imagine a dystopian future where people were wearing masks I would never have thought it was going to be so polite.Peter said that once the series is complete he hopes to hold an exhibition locally and produce a photobook of his work.My projects tend to culminate in an isolated photobook of portraits, he said.But this time I#ve also tried to include street photography just to give a wider context.And because of the phenomenal weather we#ve been having the portraits have an almost too positive a hue so I#m including deserted places, a lot of the signage relating to Covid- and the amount of discarded plastic gloves to give it a wider context for  and quarantine - otherwise it#s just a lot of people having barbecues.The main thing is to document what#s happening during lockdown and create a record of it.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Two smartphone users with the app perform a digital handshakethey meet, recording anonymous keys from each phone.If one user later comes down with coronavirus, the person they met is notied.The NHS app uses a so-called centralised system, where data from the meetings is transferred to a database.The system being used in the Republic is decentralised and data is only stored on the phones themselves.This is seen as being more private by some experts.Michael Veale, a lecturer at University College London working on contact-tracing technology, said the systems work on dferent foundations.The UK#s app will rely on self-reporting, while other apps will rely on official tests for coronavirus.Because the systems cannot communicate, it could leave people travelling across the border vulnerable.On Sunday, Dr Veale said: There are real signs that they might, particularly because the UK is a clear outlier internationally in using this particular type of approach, and that means it won#t work well across borders.The Republic of Ireland said they#re using a decentralised approach, and that will potentially create problems therethe administration chooses to effectively put in this kind of app.Mr Harris said he hoped the Republic#s contact tracing app would be made available on Apple iTunes so people here could use it. He said: It is my intention that it would of course be available to residents through the UK Apple Store. I will come back about the ways in which we can make that happen and we are having conversations with colleagues in relation to an all-island approach, of which this is one element.How smartphone app will work. The app will be downloaded onto smartphones and use Bluetooth technology to work out when other app users are in close enough proximity to potentially spread the virus.. The data is recorded under an anonymous ID, rather than by the person#s name. If someone starts showing symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-, they are able to record that on the app. . The app then sends a notication warning of possible infection to all those phone users who have been in recent close contact with that person.. The app will be able to identy who might have been infected with the virus unwittingly, and help them to limit the spread by advising them to self-isolate.. The developers say widespread take-up of the app will be crucial in making sure it works effectively. However, not everyone has an internet-enabled mobile phone and not everyone will want to download the app, which will be voluntary.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There was little social distancing taking place, and this hit home to Arlene and Michelle as they are from small rural communities where folk have been following the rules rigidly, a source told the Sunday Le.Numerous street parties took place across Belfast on Friday to celebrate VE Day at which the current guidelines were openly ignored. Adults from dferent households were observed eating and drinking together, while their children were playing on bouncy castles. Photographs taken on Saturday also showed large groups together in the city enjoying the sunshine. Meanwhile, dozens of cars were seen lining the hard shoulder for half a mile along the entrance to Gosford Forest Park in Co Armagh. Eyewitnesses said people were deliberately ignoring the rules with several cars arriving at the same time and groups of walkers going in together. The PSNI has repeatedly said that people should not drive to parks for exercise.The Stormont Executive is due to publish its roadmap this week outlining how Northern Ireland will emerge from the current Covid- enforced restrictions.

Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk started the GoFundMe campaign to help those struggling to afford day-to-day essentials, with over pound raised to date. The Causeway Coast and Glens councillor said the generosity from the community had been ‘overwhelming’. “Many in our community will have lost their income, seen businesses collapse and are facing increased living costs from being at home all day,” she said. “Families and others in our community will be struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills. I have been overwhelmed by the generosity from our community to help those in need. googletag.cmd.push “Despite the extensive measures put in place by Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, these are unprecedented times and there will still be many people who require help.” The funds will help people to purchase essentials such as groceries, sanitary items, electricity top ups and coal. Referrals to the scheme can be made to any of the Community Co-ordinators who are involved in the Community Coronavirus Response. The scheme provides support to those who are isolating at home and has tapped into strong community spirit in the area. Cllr McGurk also reiterated the call from the Executive for local residents to stay in their homes and adhere to the guidelines. googletag.cmd.push She said: “It is imperative that everyone continues to observe the social distancing and lockdown guidance issued by the Executive. “Monday saw the highest COVID- death toll here in the North since the beginning of the Pandemic, and we cannot become complacent. “I understand that it is an extraordinary ask of people to stay at home, particularlyyou are struggling financially and this is why I believe all elected representatives should work as hard as possible to alleviate the stress and strain of the lockdown. “I hope that the money I have helped to raise will be able to help some of my constituents with this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Over the last month, hundreds of messages of support have flooded into local SuperValu and Centra stores, as customers pay tribute to the huge efforts local retailers have been making to keep food on people’s tables right across Northern Ireland. These heart-warming messages have lted the spirts of hardworking local retailers and their teams, as they work tirelessly to keep shelves stocked and queues moving. Now, SuperValu and Centra are planning to pay this positivity back. The retail brands are asking customers in Derry to nominate their local store hero – the people that are going above and beyond to help their local communities during the Covid- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push For every nomination, SuperValu and Centra will donate pound to their long-standing charity partner, Action Cancer. With fundraising events cancelled and Action Cancer retail shops closed as a result of the Covid- Pandemic, the charity needs to raise vital funds, so it can provide le-saving cancer prevention, detection and support services to those most in need as soon as services can get back up and running.  Launching the new initiative, Desi Derby, Marketing Director for SuperValu and Centra in NI said: “Our frontline workers are going above and beyond and doing a fantastic job – making sure shelves are stocked, delivering to those in need and ensuring customers stay safe when in store. googletag.cmd.push We have been overwhelmed by the dferent messages of thanks and appreciation that have come in from our customers whether on social media or via our customer services team and so we wanted to recognise this in the first instance. “Those same frontline colleagues also work tirelessly every year to raise money for Action Cancer and asked how we could do more when social distancing prevents the normal fundraisers such as in-store cycles and coffee mornings. So, we decided to bring the recognition of our colleagues and our commitment to support our charity partner together. We are now asking customers to take the time to nominate the person in your local store that has made a real dference. Andat this time of crisis, when our charity partner Action Cancer is seeing a substantial drop in income, being able to help support them too is extremely important to us.” People can nominate their local store hero on the SuperValu or Centra Facebook page or by emailingsupervalu.localhero@musgrave.ieor centra.localhero@musgrave.ie.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident

by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs

natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair, who spent more than half an hour in the water without wet suits or lejackets, were only saved by a quick thinking passer-by who raised the alarm and contacted the Coastguard.With incidents like this

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down.

He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since . I usually deliver approximately  school sessions per week to roughly  pupils in Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI play and coach for Comber Rec Ladies. I am proud to have played a key part in bringing womenrsquos football to my home town team and for helping to create opportunities for almost  seniors and  juniors to enjoy the game.Heather says parents can help teach their children with the help of weekly videos which are being released by the IFA and Electric Ireland.ldquoThese videos are fantastic tools for keeping your budding football stars interested in sport and passionate about football, as well as encouraging them to stay active while their usual activity sessions are on hold, she said.The Shooting Stars programme provides opportunities for girls aged - to have fun, make friends and learn the fundamentals of football. Sessions are normally held at  centres across Northern Ireland.Heather says the programme is a starting point for young girls who are encouraged to take the next step and join a local club.ldquoObviously with the current situation the sessions have not been taking place but the coaches have been working hard to ensure that the girls are staying connected, keeping up their skills at home by putting out a iety of social media videos with challenges and tips.The weekly videos can be viewed on IFA social media channels on Tuesday and Fridays..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"Lockdown no hindrance to local runners of all abilities  ","story":"A LOT is being said and reported about the absence of sporting activities on foot of the cancellation or postponement of many major events, including Sundayrsquos River Rock Belfast City Marathon, because of the need for social distancing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics will impact seriously on all the athletes who had been training for the races of their lives this summer, some as the culmination of their careers.But it is not only the elite runners, throwers and jumpers who have had their plans and lives disrupted by the world wide pandemic.It affects everybody who takes exercise in any shape or form, including the runners of all abilities who may not be a member of any athletics club but have been running for years and for whom running has become a way of le.I know that runners often go out on their own to train and in fact many have been resourceful over the past week in finding places which are virtually people free to enable them to complete their training sessions in safe surroundings. I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work. We have had to reorganise the office and stagger the earlier start times of some staff but they have all risen to the challenge.The Downpatrick office delivers throughout the wider Downpatrick area as far as Seaforde, Ardglass, Crossgar and Saintfield.Mr Carabine said: ldquoThe workers are more than holding their own in terms of maintaining deliveries and keeping themselves safe, although in some areas, due to the need to protect workers, the service is a bit later than usual..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s Leah battling to raise cash for charity  ","story":"A SAINTFIELD mum is throwing her weight behind a gruelling event to raise money for charity.Leah McCourt, a champion mixed martial arts fighter, is undergoing a test of strength and endurance challenge for Christian Aid, which is responding to the coronavirus crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world.Over five days, -year-old Leah will be attempt to complete , exercises carrying a weighted bag used by combat athletes to build strength.Starting on Monday, Leah will complete the daunting daily task of , squats and lunges while carrying on her shoulders the crescent-shaped lsquoBulgarian bagrsquo filled with  kilos of sand and wool.

In anticipation of what none of us wants to hear, politicians at Westminister got an earful from no less a person than Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, who warned there could be ‘social unrest’the over s are ‘forced to endure a longer lockdown than the younger generation’.This is a country where once upon a time women could retire at  and men at  – as that was regarded as old age. But people have been living longer due to better living standards, the results of all the hard work the baby boomer generation put in right up to the present time. This appears to have emboldened successive Governments to raise the age of retirement age for both men and women. More money in the public coffers is the result.

Please try again later.Submitting...The retirement age may well rise in the longer term to  yearsnot , a prospect feared by every worker in the country. Yet, politicians remain silent on this. Putting up the age of retirement also means there will be less years for state pensions to be paid out.I worry at what appears to be the increasing use of the term ‘healthy over s’. What exactly does that mean  Few people in this age category I suspect enjoy perfect health, otherwise GPs across the land wouldn’t be advising them to take statins to keep blood pressure levels down. Women have been encouraged to take HRT long after menopause, even staying on it for leneeds be. These le enhancers, as some medical people appear to regard them, may be just the ticket. But how are we to know since the latter, statins, are relatively new to the people whilst HRT still attracts controversy Do either of these treatments increase longevity  We simply don’t know the answer to that question.Locking down the over-s, many of whom will still be paying tax to the Government, could be interpreted in many ways. I will take the kindly approach and suggest that the Government will need all the scope it has to get the economy back up and running schools will have to be re-opened and plans will have to be laid for the possibility of a future pandemic since the current one caught everyone by surprise and left the country on its knees. With the absolute necessity to get people back to work and paying income tax, the Government must have thought the oldies could wait and since many of them will have ious ailments it could be dressed up as ‘protecting them’. One Cabinet minister has said the whole thing ‘is to be based around consent rather than compulsion’.That’s fine, but it appears no one asked us first whether we wanted to be lockdowned for longer or left to do our own thing.I certainly do not want to be on lockdown for any more weeks than I have to because once you hit your s le seems to go by in a flash. It seems no time since my children were clinging to my skirts wanting me to play in the garden. Anniversaries and birthdays came and went with me so busy I scarcely noticed. The children grew up with me hardly noticing the years go by and then they were off to university. They found themselves wives, leaving us at home, on our own, wondering where all the years had gone. But still we felt young, still able to work and go on holiday.We hardly noticed our th birthdays, then last year it was the th wedding anniversary. We still have brothers and sisters and the only recognition of ageing is when the much older members in the wider family, the true older generation, pass on. I don’t think I’m the older generation yet.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

That was a new project we’d started up in Fermanagh, North Down and Ards, Mid and East Antrim and the Newry area. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“We have for years done a lot of work with people with learning disabilities as well as youth groups.”He said the  freelance tutors at the circus all have a wide range of skills including street entertainers, percussionists, a film maker.In terms of adapting to lockdown Jim said: “When the lockdown restrictions came the first thing we did was put on videos which relate to what you can do at home, things like how to make juggling equipment.“We’re learning as we go. The next stage is we’ve decided to lend our kit. “Where we had workshop equipment that should have been being used at the moment we might as well lend it out to participants who are now stuck at home.“We’ve older people in Fermanagh, we’ve just got to work out how to get it to them.”He continued: “For the next stage we’ve tied in with a group in the north east who work with asylum seekers and refugees, they would be more advanced than us in terms of working with Zoom. We’re learning from them on how to use Zoom for classes.“One of our guys is doing a session on a Friday morning using Zoom for the older people who would normally have come in.“We are now working with them to seewe can actively teach across Zoom.“We all know about Zoom as a meeting medium, but can I stand in a room here and observe someone’s juggling close enough through Zoom that I can give them active guidance  It then opens up the potential to teach online one-to-one or to groups of people.“It takes away the need to physically be anywhere.“We’ve had a committee meeting on Zoom and it was the first time we’ve had % attendance. I think we had more done in  minutes and had more good ideas than ever before.“Because circus is a physical activity, you have to think a little bit more deeply about what goes on when you’re teaching.“You realise that you’ve got to encourage people, inspire people and engage with people.“If you can do that online we can reach people who are isolating. When you think of those people in Fermanagh, they were always very rural, and they can now link with us better than ever.”Streetwise Community Circus receives funding from Arts Council, Belfast City Council and Lottery Community Fund.Jim said the tutors were offering all the circus skills apart from aerial: “We can only offer aerial in the centre that we’re based in.“You’ve got juggling, unicycling, stilt walking, things like that, diablo, hat tricks, poi – which is the ribbon that you spin around yourself.“The simplest thing to learn I would say is scarf juggling because that gets the pattern going. You can do a lot of stuff with less than three balls. With one scarf you can pick up the co-ordination needed to juggle.“You start with one scarf and realise you can flip it around dferent ways and catch it, then it’s game on. “Once you’ve started, the circus is about getting the skill, practising it, then improving with practice.“You don’t put a ceiling on it, there’s no starting point of entry and there’s no ceiling.”Asked how useful it was for older people and people with learning dficulties to learn circus skills, Jim said: “There’s a couple of aspects. Circus is not for everybody, not all older people want to juggle, but people who do try circus skills, the feedback is they love it because it’s really invigorating. “On a Friday morning I’ve got video footage of older people kne throwing. They’re loving it.“We’ve had people in their s stilt walking in the Lisburn Carnival, they’re active and are loving the fact they can do these new things.”He added: “Disability is the same. We do a summer school for adults with learning disabilities. They devise their own shows. They’re not defined by their disability when they’re there.
