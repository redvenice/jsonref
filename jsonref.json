I was introduced to them at a house party that I attended in the Washington D.C. area.‘Following that first introduction, I attended well over ten house parties in the Washington D.C. area during the years 1981-1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present…‘On numerous occasions at these parties, I witnessed Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh drink excessively and engage in highly inappropriate conduct, including being overly aggressive with girls and not taking no for an answer. This conduct included the fondling and grabbing of girls without the consent.’      Previously, both Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have alleged that Kavanaugh engaged in serious sexual misconduct. Ford is slated to testify in the U.S. Senate on September 27 while Ramirez is reportedly ‘willing to testify’ as well.Despite the sexual misconduct allegations made against him, Kavanaugh has vowed not to withdraw his nomination, calling the accusations ‘false and uncorroborated’ and part of a ‘last-minute character assassination’ on him. Who is Roger Mathews?

Meghan closing her own car door before walking into the opening of \u0027Oceania\u0027 at the Royal Academy of Arts Royal experts are thrilled that their cast of characters is being expanded as Kate Middleton is returning to ‘work’ soon after her maternity leave - apparently those appearances at posh weddings were ‘private’ events, in case you wondered.This week the royal watchers went into overdrive, signalling that September 2018 will go down in the history books as the moment when a smiley mixed race woman finally dragged the British monarchy into the 21st century.It was accomplished with a simple- some might say humble- gesture, one that summed up (according to sycophants) her totally ‘modern’ approach to her new toff status. Yes, Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, CLOSED HER OWN CAR DOOR!JANET STREET-PORTER: It may be a Rotten public image, but let’s salute King of Punk John Lydon for letting it all hang out – and sneering at the Instagram generationJANET STREET-PORTER: Rees-Mogg\u0027s nanny-botherer is a nasty piece of work but I\u0027ve still got more time for him than Serena pretending her tantrums are a political protest JANET STREET-PORTER: Kim, Coleen and me and how an unfortunate few minutes of television turned into a terrifying witch-hunt of one of the nicest women I knowJANET STREET-PORTER: If Harry, Meghan and Eugenie want to live it large like reality TV stars they\u0027d better have a Plan B... when the paying public has had enough JANET STREET-PORTER: Boris Johnson is a buffoon but if there\u0027s one thing we all need to agree on it\u0027s that our society is built on the absolute freedom to disagreeJANET STREET-PORTER: If boys are growing up to become anti-social yobs, their parents must pay tooThe nanny-state panic over Britain’s heatwave makes my blood boil, says JANET STREET-PORTER. They know how to cope with the sun Down Under… so it’s time to send for the Aussies! JANET STREET-PORTER: If there was any evidence against Cliff he should have been tried in court, not on the BBC news by a hysterical reporter and a bunch of publicity hungry copsJANET STREET-PORTER: With their broken Heathrow promises, two-faced Theresa and duplicitous Boris have tossed their green principles in the trashArriving at London’s Royal Academy on her first solo engagement, to open Oceania, an exhibition showcasing the art and culture of the Pacific, Meghan stepped out of her limo - the door held open by a flunkey - then, turned around and closed it.Job done, she could get on with meeting a lineup of important people, delivering a short speech, and rubbing noses with a group of maori dancers and performers.Immediately, the Sun’s Royal Correspondent was congratulating the Duchess for showing she could still ‘take the time’ for these simple little tasks. Etiquette expert William Hanson offered up his take on door-gate, in case we hadn’t understood it’s importance - ‘it is usually done by others for security reasons’.I find that closing the car door is also a good idea if the weather is windy, in case it blows back on your leg, wrecking your £25 Wolford designer tights, or (worse) mows down a passing cyclist, who will start shouting obscenities.Meghan had clearly practised for this earth-shattering moment. Arriving at the launch of a charity cookbook in aid of the Grenfell survivors with her mother a few days earlier, she leapt out of the back seat and quickly shut the door.I’m sure security staff are already mulling over the implications of her impetuous actions - more of this kind of behaviour could result in staff redundancies.          The gesture generated praise for Meghan\u0027s humble attitude, but Janet Street-Porter is not convincedSadly, Meghan is not the trail-blazer we hoped - it has emerged that the Duchess of Cambridge has been shutting her own car door for some time, even whilst carrying Princess Charlotte in her arms back in 2016.Meghan might be trying to send a message that she’s the same simple girl, but as etiquette expert Mr Hanson reminds us ‘life is very different for Meghan now she’s joined The Firm -‘ no more selfies or autographs.No vote and no public social media’.Meghan says she’s a feminist who fights for women’s rights, but she signed away her chance to vote for our democracy. Maybe the chance to wear a procession of couture outfits costing thousands of pounds and live with a multi-millionaire made that bitter pill easier to swallow.          Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft, according to Janet Street-PorterAnd those four inch heels? They are not footwear women can fight in, they are unsteady and uncomfortable. A woman can wear what she chooses, but in Meghan’s position - cue the car door moment - everything she doessays and wears will be picked over.Playing netball in high heels at an awards ceremony in Loughborough this week was just plain daft. Meghan wants other women to feel comfortable and be themselves, not conform to hackneyed stereotypes, but she needs to lead by real example, not car door handle moments.She projects a very narrow, version of glamorous femininity, in complete contract to her mother, who seems much happier in her own skin and who has her own relaxed style.Fans gushed that the ‘door closing’ moment showed that Meghan was ‘humble’ and ‘down to earth’…’just like the rest of us’. According to the etiquette expert ‘she’s going to be doing things her way and helping to adapt and progress the British Monarchy’.As Private Eye would say, pass the sickbag. I find it’s easier to be modern when wearing a £2500 Givenchy dress and channelling Audrey Hepburn, although it’s not a look I plan to emulate on the London Underground any time soon.When it comes to Royal transport, Meghan is a fast learner, having made a mistake on her first public engagement with the Queen, by faffing about next to their car, and then asking Ma’am which side she fancied sitting on.Apparently the Queen ‘always sits behind the driver, although etiquette stipulates that the most senior person in a car should sit diagonally behind the chauffeur’.Just keep that pearl of wisdom in your mind, when you’re arguing about who gets the most leg room in the Uber home after a night out. And make sure you shut the door."},{"url":null,"title":"Why nearly half Japanese 40s virgins","story":"    Almost half of young Japanese people are virgins because they don\u0027t have time to date and prefer alternatives such as pornography and sex robots, a documentary has found (stock image of Tokyo)          Some 60 per cent of women and 70 per cent of men aged 18-34 said they were single. Pictured: Magazines at a sex shop in JapanOne main reason was that people said they are working increasingly long hours with low job security, meaning they are struggling to find time to date.City worker Taiyo Hashimoto, 26, told the show: \u0027I\u0027m supposed to finish work at 7pm but I work overtime basically every day.\u0027He said he regularly stays at work until the last train home at midnight and when he rarely does socialise, he attends drinks with his boss.Reclusive \u0027Japanese author\u0027, 46, and two family members,...International manhunt is launched for fugitive Iranian boss...Share this article\u0027I have to keep up with him, which is hard on me.

That\u0027s what you\u0027re expected to do,\u0027 he said.With full-time work declining for those aged 18-34, it is thought many Japanese people are worried about getting married and having children without long-term job security and sound finances. Hashimoto also explained that the abundance of alternatives to sex means there is less urgency to find a girlfriend.           people said they are working increasingly long hours with low job security and poor prospects for higher pay, meaning they are struggling to find time to date (stock image)          Japan has multibillion-dollar sex industry made up of hostess bars, fetish clubs, masturbation clubs, and more. Pictured: Neon lights in the red light district of Kabukicho in Shinjuku, TokyoJapan has multibillion-dollar sex industry made up of hostess bars, fetish clubs, masturbation clubs, love hotels, sex shops, maid cafes and a rapid rise in the popularity of increasingly realistic sex dolls and robots. \u0027Men go to brothels or massage parlours, fuelled by after-work drinks with their colleagues. That sort of thing is common,\u0027 Hashimoto explained.Relationship therapist Ai Aoyama added: \u0027There are lots of places for men to have fun. Men don\u0027t have to bother having a girlfriend.\u0027 It has long been know that people\u0027s reluctance to enter relationships is affecting the county\u0027s birthrate. In May, statistics revealed the number of children in Japan has fallen for the 37th consecutive year despite the country\u0027s efforts to offset its ageing population.          A sign at a sex shop in TokyoThere were 15.53 million children under the age of 14 in Japan as of April 1, 2018.This is a decrease of 170,000 from the previous year and continues the downward spiral which started in 1981, according to the data by the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry.The decline in numbers also isn\u0027t likely to end soon as older children made up the largest section of the category, with 3.26 million 12 to 14-year-olds.Only Tokyo showed an increase in the amount of children compared to the previous year, despite efforts by the Shinzo Abe government to encourage adults to have more youngsters.Children made up just 12.3 per cent of Japan\u0027s total population of 126 million - in contract to the US\u0027s 18.9 per cent and China\u0027s 16.8 per cent, report CNN.Japan wishes to increase its fertility rate - the average number of children a woman in the country has in her lifetime - by 0.35 to 1.8 by the end of 2025, according to the Japan Times.The government is aiming to reach this goal through one time cash payments.Unlike many other industrialised countries who have been struggling with low birth rates, Japan has failed to increase its population through immigrants.Foreigners made up 1.3 per cent of Japan\u0027s population in 2013 compared to seven per cent for the US, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).A projection by the Japanese Health Ministry suspects that Japan\u0027s population will plunge to 86.74 million by 2060 - leaving the country\u0027s economy with a problem.The steady decline in numbers will mean less workers paying taxes to support an ever ageing population in need of pensions and healthcare.           Japan wishes to increase its fertility rate - the average number of children a woman in the country has in her lifetime - by 0.35 to 1.8 by the end of 2025, according to the Japan Times.

GP surgeries are already in crisis due to a shortage of GPs, combined with the growing pressures of the ageing population. An average of one in seven GP posts is unfilled.Professor Stokes-Lampard said many were leaving to work for Babylon and other firms where they could earn up to £120,000 a year. Others had cut down on their surgery hours to do a few sessions for these private firms a week, working from home, she said.\u0027It\u0027s the higher salaries, the ability to work from home and that they look after people, in terms of the training and perks and benefits. They\u0027re paying above what the NHS pays.\u0027Babylon Health offers patients ten-minute consultations – via smartphones or computers – for £25 a time. It provides these appointments free to patients who live or work in London if they de-register from their existing GP surgery and sign up with its practice in west London.A total of 32,000 patients have joined since its launch in November, including Mr Hancock, who described the service as \u0027revolutionary\u0027.The firm is planning to expand to Birmingham and Manchester over the next few months.A current job listing offers GPs a salary of £100,000 a year to work from home or £120,000 a year if they are based in the west London practice or one of four other London hubs.It promises doctors \u0027no home visits ever\u0027, \u0027no paperwork\u0027 and \u0027no never-ending duty days\u0027. This is where GPs have to remain on surgery premises to see emergency patients.Professor Stokes-Lampard is also concerned that the safety of online consultations has not been properly tested in a clinical trial – like a new drug.She will challenge Mr Hancock\u0027s endorsement of Babylon at a fringe event at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham next Monday.A Babylon spokesman said: \u0027The Royal College is absolutely right to highlight that practices all too often do not have enough GPs.

This undated image is alleged to show Chepiga (circled) posing with fellow members of the Russian military  The dark star of Russia\u0027s elite special forces school: Colonel who signed up at 18, was honoured at gaudy memorial to military and then sent to kill Skripal The highly-decorated spy blamed for the Salisbury poisonings was a veteran of Russia\u0027s elite special forces and had trained at one of the country\u0027s top military academies, it emerged last night.The man behind the alias of Boshirov was unmasked by the investigative website as Colonel Chepiga - a GRU intelligence officer bestowed with Russia\u0027s highest state award.His military career began at the age of 18 when he enrolled in a top military school just 25 miles from his tiny home village of Nikolaevka, near the Russia-China border.Col Chepiga studied at the Far Eastern Military Command Academy in Blagoveschensk, an elite training ground for \u0027Spetsnaz\u0027 special forces officers.His name features on a memorial wall at the school under the Gold Star honour list. After graduating from the school with honours in 2001, he was assigned to Russia\u0027s 14th Spetsnaz Brigade, based in the far-eastern city of Khabarovsk.  Dawn Sturgess (left) died after spraying Novichok on her wrists thinking it was a perfume. Her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, (right) fell critically ill but recoveredSpetsnaz units are responsible for highly-secretive missions and are equivalent to the British SAS.Under the command of the GRU, Russia\u0027s military intelligence agency, his brigade played a vital role in the second Chechen war and was also spotted near the Ukrainian border in late 2014.The information was revealed by investigative website Bellingcat, which had conducted a painstaking investigation into his background.It said that his unit had deployed three times to Chechnya, where Russia was carrying out what it called a \u0027counter-terrorist operation\u0027.The website of a state-run military volunteer organisation claims that Col Chepiga received more than 20 military awards and decorations in the course of his service.And his former military school proudly boasts on its website that he was bestowed his homeland\u0027s highest honour, Hero of the Russian Federation, in 2014. The award is often presented by Vladimir Putin himself.  This map shows the progress of the spies\u0027 assassination plot, as police managed to piece together using CCTV               The two men chose a hotel in east London, 127 miles from Salisbury, despite heading to the city twice in three daysWhile the achievements of his fellow award-winners are detailed extensively, Col Chepiga\u0027s simply says it was awarded \u0027by decree from the Russian president\u0027. Bellingcat speculated that he could have been given the award for operations in Eastern Ukraine – where Russia\u0027s military was secretly operating in 2014.Senior Russian military officials have since said that so-called \u0027little green men\u0027 – soldiers wearing uniforms with no insignia – were in fact members of Russia\u0027s Spetsnaz deployed secretly to Ukraine. The Bellingcat website also found an undated photograph of graduates from the Far Eastern Military Command Academy on assignment in Chechnya.It pointed out that the man on the far right looks strikingly similar to the man named as Boshirov by the Metropolitan Police – although it said it could not prove conclusively it was the same person.They came across the photograph after sources said the school was a likely place for a Russian military officer with a specialism in Western European operations to have trained.

Both were critically ill after the Novichok attack in SalisburyAfter further digging, they came across the mysterious Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. Address databases link him to the Military Unit 20662 – code for the 14th Spetsnaz Brigade.The logo of the brigade is a black bat with a yellow parachute behind it. It was formed in the 1960s and has been under the command of the GRU for much of its history. According to Yuri Shvets, a former KGB agent, GRU officers were referred to as \u0027boots\u0027 – tough but unsophisticated.Once a member of the GRU, it is believed to be exceptionally difficult to leave. And those who do so to join foreign agencies are punished savagely.Viktor Suvorov, a GRU officer who defected to Britain in 1978, said new recruits were shown a video of a traitor from the agency being burned alive in a furnace as a warning. The GRU has become adept as using so-called \u0027non-linear warfare\u0027, which uses a combination of covert special forces operations, spying, cyber attacks and internet trolls to destabilise enemy nations.It started as an intelligence-gathering agency for Trotsky\u0027s Bolshevik Red Army, and Lenin insisted it remain separate from the other intelligence organisations.Today it still sits apart from the SVR, the external spying service, and the domestic FSB (the equivalents of Britain\u0027s MI6 and MI5), which were created when the notorious KGB was split in 1991.  How will the West react to proof Putin lied?Commentary by Owen Matthews THIS sensational revelation – the seniority of the would-be assassin and the official state support for the mission – shows that the Skripal hit must have been ordered at the very highest levels of the Russian state.The evidence that Vladimir Putin personally ordered the attack grows stronger every day.Indeed, by presiding over one of the most farcically inept cover-ups in memory – when the two Russians caught on CCTV here claimed to have been tourists visiting Salisbury cathedral – Putin has condemned himself out of his own mouth.Days after British police released dozens of security camera images of the pair on their way from Moscow to Salisbury, Putin appeared on Russian television to defend them as \u0027innocent Russian citizens about whom we know nothing\u0027. His fingerprints were all over the operation.The following afternoon, \u0027Petrov\u0027 and \u0027Boshirov\u0027 themselves appeared to air a cock-and-bull story about being turned back from their mission to see Salisbury by slush – two days in a row.          Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the two suspects were just civilians and not members of the GRUBefore the denials by Putin and by the suspects themselves, it might have been possible to argue plausibly that the botched assassination attempt was some kind of rogue operation by Russia\u0027s secret services.But Putin\u0027s personal defence of the suspects and the inept cover-up job by the state-controlled media constitute strong, if wholly unintended, proof of the Kremlin\u0027s deep complicity.And now the Bellingcat revelations have added incontrovertible layers of detail to the emerging picture of a top-level GRU assassination squad operating on UK soil.Using mostly open-source data, Bellingcat\u0027s researchers first unearthed details of the passports the suspects used to enter the UK, published by British police.Petrov and Boshirov\u0027s passport numbers, it turned out, varied by just a single digit – and were issued by a Moscow office used exclusively for officials\u0027 travel documents. Even more suspiciously, Boshirov\u0027s passport file was stamped \u0027Do not reveal information\u0027.Then, yesterday, came the clincher. By trawling through the records of GRU academy graduation classes, Bellingcat matched the photos of \u0027Boshirov\u0027 to the real-life Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga. Once they had a name, details of Colonel Chepiga\u0027s secret service popped up all over the internet, in online posts by veterans\u0027 groups and even written in letters of gold on a stone monument to the decorated graduates of one of the GRU\u0027s secret intelligence academies.Chepiga served in Chechnya with the Spetznaz, the elite forces of the Federal Security Service, where by some reports he received 20 awards and decorations.In short, Putin has been caught out telling analogue lies in a digital world.          Counter-terrorism police released images of two suspects in connection with the Salisbury attack and named them as Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov (circled right)Bellingcat became famous for its painstaking investigation into the downing of a Malaysian Airlines Boeing over Eastern Ukraine in July 2014, collecting photos from social media and intelligence data showing the hour-by-hour progress of the Buk missile system which downed the plane, from a military base inside Russia into Eastern Ukraine and back again.Russia\u0027s vehement denials of involvement were shown to be false. Now, with Bellingcat\u0027s dozens of detailed revelations about the true identity of one of the would-be Skripal assassins, another of the Kremlin\u0027s brazen lies has been carefully picked apart.Perhaps the most terrifying part of the whole tragic story of the Skripal poisoning, which resulted in the death of an innocent British bystander, is the shocking combination of the Kremlin\u0027s deadly intent and utter incompetence.Instead of quietly disposing of a \u0027traitor\u0027, Chepiga and his as-yet-unnamed accomplice succeeded in contaminating parts of Salisbury, murdering an innocent woman, and revealing themselves to the whole world as bungling idiots.Attempting extra-judicial execution on British soil is bad enough. But to spread deadly nerve agent around a cathedral city is irresponsible bungling on an epic scale.The question now, of course, is what the response of the West will be to this damning revelation.Will Theresa May call for renewed sanctions?

But he then began to ask me questions about my husband asking how I satisfy him and what would I do if he was feeling sexual.\u0027Dr Ihsan then asked me how I would pleasure my husband and I responded by saying manually. I felt uncomfortable and I tried to get back on to my symptoms rather than answering his questions.\u0027          A medical tribunal heard he asked one woman to have sex with him on his desk while other patients waited in the next room to see himThe woman said Ihsan became more \u0027explicit and irrelevant\u0027 and asked her about her orgasms. She later reported the matter to the health centre.The second woman saw the doctor for a review about her contraception and he told her: \u0027I can tell you are in a good place - you look good.\u0027In her statement, the second complainant said: \u0027Dr Ihsan then moved his chair towards to me and said \u0027I\u0027m horny me\u0027.Is your GP surgery at risk of closure?

He said I was beautiful and I had soft skin. He then touched my right cheek with his left hand.\u0027She reminded him he had patients waiting outside, but he replied: I can lock the door if you want me to. He added: I can tell you look after yourself by looking at your nails. I want to show you something, I want you to see my balls - I really, really want you to see my balls. He then offered to clear his desk and have sex on it.\u0027Last November Ihsan who admitted ten charges but denied 21 others was found guilty of sexually motivated misconduct towards the second woman but a disciplinary panel found his conduct towards the first complainant was not sexually motivated.           Two complaints were made while Dr Ihsan was working as a locum at the Church View Health Centre in South Kirkby near WakefieldAt the time his mentor - a senior doctor - wrote a testimonial on his behalf saying: \u0027I believe that Dr lhsan is showing insight about the seriousness of the case, and has the ability to reflect on what has happened and to behave differently if such a case arises in future.\u0027The latest incident took place in April 2017 after Ihsan moved to Kings Lynn, Norfolk to take up a job at Queen Elisabeth Hospital. He exposed himself to the housekeeper whilst she was retrieving cleaning items from her trolley.The woman claimed he locked the door to the flat then pushed into her a corner before dropping his towel and grabbing her bottom. She said she managed to break free when her mobile phone rang and she unlocked the door before escaping.Ihsan admitted being wearing nothing but a towel in front of the housekeeper but was cleared of making sexual advances towards her.He denied being a \u0027serial abuser\u0027 and claimed a \u0027good and useful doctor who got on well with patients and colleagues.\u0027Of the incident with the housekeeper he told the hearing: \u0027I told her I needed to go out and asked if she would mind if I had a shower... I asked about a shower in part to gauge her reaction.\u0027In making the tribunal\u0027s ruling panel chairman Jane Wheat said: \u0027The Tribunal had regard to the additional information about Dr Ihsan\u0027s previous GMC history, in particular, the previous finding of sexually motivated conduct.\u0027It concluded that having had two adverse findings of sexually motivated conduct, on two occasions less than a year apart, demonstrated Dr Ihsan\u0027s lack of appreciation of sexual boundaries. Erasure from the medical register is the appropriate and proportionate outcome in this case to mark the seriousness with which it viewed Dr Ihsan\u0027s behaviour.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Pictured Woman 49 remains Yorkshire cottage","story":"    Police asked anyone with information about Rina Yasutake, 49, to get in touch with themPolice have released the identity of the body found in the home of a reclusive Japanese family in a historic market town.She was identified as Rina Yasutake, 49, whose address was given as a property in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, the house where her remains were found.However neighbours reacted with astonishment when shown her picture.One said: \u0027I have lived near them for years and I can\u0027t recall ever seeing that lady. They were so secretive in the way that they lived that no one really knew exactly who lived at the address.\u0027North Yorkshire Police issued an appeal for anyone with information about Ms Yasutake to get in touch with them.She has the same family name as the registered owner of the property, a woman named Michiko Yasutake.A man aged 46, a woman aged 51, and a woman aged 75 were arrested and released on bail under investigation after police were called in on Tuesday.

Now, more than 53 years later, Schatzberg is releasing a book titled Dylan By Schatzberg that showcases a comprehensive collection of both photos and countless stories. Dylan is pictured above posing inside of Schatzberg photography studio in 1965          For more than six decades,  Schatzberg has used his camera lens to capture dozens of A-listers, artists, politicians and elite musicians. Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Andy Warhol, Sammy Davis Jr., Duke of Windsor (the abdicated King Edward VIII) and Ted Kennedy have all posed for him. But of all the high-profile iniduals the 91-year-old photographer has interacted with,  Dylan was his best photographic subject. As Schatzberg says: \u0027You just point the camera at him and things happen.\u0027 The singer is pictured above in a photo while smoking a cigarette in 1965          Schatzberg shared that the pair became fast friends and would often hang out together along with other musicians at restaurants or night clubs. The photographer remarked that people have often asked if the out-of-focus image on the cover of Blonde on Blonde represented a drug trip. It doesn\u0027t. They were just really, really cold. \u0027It was something that actually is an honest image. He was cold and I was shaking, I was cold and the camera was shaking,\u0027 he said. Pictured above is another image taken of Dylan from the same shoot for the Blonde on Blonde cover in the Meat Packing District of Manhattan Schatzberg was so moved that he asked a mutual friend if the musician would agree to being photographed. The next day he was surprised to receive a phone call from Dylan\u0027s then-wife, Sara Dylan. Her husband had agreed. \u0027I showed up the next day and he was great,\u0027 Schatzberg said of his initial encounter with Dylan in a recording studio in 1965. \u0027Immediately he wanted me to hear something that he had just recorded. I was a little intimidated, but it was great.\u0027Schatzberg explained that after showing him the first set of photos he captured with his Nikon camera  that Dylan liked them and agreed to being photographed more by Schatzberg, who was then aged 38 and had already shot covers for Vogue, Life, Esquire and Glamour.\u0027The first set of pictures were done in the studio pretty much under his control. …He would feel at home in the recording studio where he knows everything that\u0027s going on. And so I asked him to come to my studio and he said yeah,\u0027 Schatzberg said.\u0027I didn\u0027t tell him that I wanted him to come to my studio because I have more control there. I wanted to be the boss. \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent.\u0027          Schatzberg, pictured above at home in his apartment with his new book, remarked: \u0027After we got to know each other, we had no problem at all, anything I suggested he took in his mind and we built a good relationship. He was just like anybody else. He was very funny and he\u0027s a very special talent\u0027          During some of Dylan\u0027s early performances, Schatzberg recounted how he did not always receive rave reviews from his audiences. When Dylan showcased a few new songs from his album Highway 61 Revisited while performing on August 28, 1965, he was booed. \u0027He said \u0027f*** \u0027em, I don\u0027t care\u0027 in response to being booed. He knew what he wanted to do with his music – he was a country singer, folk singer and that\u0027s a certain style,\u0027 Schatzberg said.

It was the beginning of February 1966, so it was very cold and he was wearing a light jacket,\u0027 he recalled of the chilly weather, which can be as low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-6 Celsius). \u0027So I asked him if he would go outside because I didn\u0027t like the shots I was getting into the studio. It was okay, but it wasn\u0027t something special. So he said yeah and had on a little jacket.          Of Dylan, Schatzberg said: \u0027I think of him as one of my greatest subject matters and I protect that a lot. I still do today, I just won\u0027t give my pictures to everybody or sell them to everybody.\u0027 Dylan is pictured above holding a picture frame as prop inside Schatzberg\u0027s photography studio in the mid-1960s          Schatzberg said, \u0027He\u0027s just got something to him and I felt working with him and knowing him, I was able to get into his soul and get deeper into him and a lot of my photographs I look at them and I find them amazing.\u0027 The Blowing in the Wind singer is pictured above looking deeply into the camera in another image captured by Schatzberg inside his studio           Schatzberg said that Dylan is \u0027a very special talent\u0027 and the images that are included of him in his new book showcase that. The Like a Rolling Stone singer is pictured above releasing cigarette smoke in a striking image that Schatzberg captured in the mid-1960s  Schatzberg\u0027s book also reveals a several stories about his experiences with Dylan during the 1960s while showcasing dozens of images that coincide with those stories. The now-77-year-old musician is pictured above in an image while smoking a cigarette and holding a prop inside Schatzberg\u0027s photography studio in the mid-1960s          Schatzberg, who has also directed several films starring Willie Nelson, Morgan Freeman, Faye Dunaway and Al Pacino, said that he and Dylan haven\u0027t seen each other since they both were guests at a mutual friends wedding in the 1970s as both of their careers had moved into different directions and locations.

I\u0027d give him a drum and he straddled the drum or do something else, because he didn\u0027t feel that I was going to make him look like a fool or anything,\u0027 the award-winning photographer stated.\u0027I think of him as one of my greatest subject matters and I protect that a lot. I still do today, I just won\u0027t give my pictures to everybody or sell them to everybody.\u0027I made him feel that he could do anything he wanted and it would be okay, and I didn\u0027t impose things on him that he felt was silly. He was able to make somethings up, you can see in my photographs.\u0027He\u0027s just got something to him and I felt working with him and knowing him, I was able to get into his soul and get deeper into him and a lot of my photographs I look at them and I find them amazing.\u0027Schatzberg, who has also directed several films starring Willie Nelson, Morgan Freeman, Faye Dunaway and Al Pacino, said that he and Dylan haven\u0027t seen each other since they both were guests at a mutual friends wedding in the 1970s as both of their careers had moved into different directions and locations.   Dylan By Schatzberg will go on sale in the United States on October 25 and can be purchased in the U.K. beginning on October 1.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/08/50AE5F7000000578-0-image-a-11_1537948016675.jpg","title":"Jeff Flake says vote confirm Kavanaugh","story":"    Democrats including Sen.

Kavanaugh issued his own tearful and emotional denial, then attacked panel Democrats of being part of a conspiracy to bring his nomination down. Democrats, outnumbered on a committee and helpless to stop the pace of the nomination, inveighed against Kavanaugh\u0027s testimony – where he accused Democrats of running a \u0027search and destroy\u0027 mission against him.Even with Judiciary approval, which now appeared nearly certain  on a party-line vote, a handful of Republican and Democratic centrists hold Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s fate in their hands after an electrifying day of testimony which saw him fight for his professional life and Christine Blasey Ford repeat her detailed claim that he once sexually assaulted her.The White House still would not say Friday it has the votes to prevail on the floor. \u0027AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT\u0027: DIANNE FEINSTEIN ATTACKS KAVANAUGH\u0027This is someone who was aggressive and belligerent,\u0027 Feinstein, the senior panel Democrat said at the hearing.In the 25 years on this committee, I have never seen a nominee for any position behave in that manner. Judge Kavanaugh used as much political rhetoric as my Republican colleagues. And, what\u0027s more, he went on the attack,\u0027 she said. \u0027I have never seen a nominee for any position behave in that matter,\u0027 Feinstein said, defending herself against charges that she or her staff were involved in the leak of Ford\u0027s allegations, something she denied at Thursday\u0027s hearing.Furious Democrats walked out of the hearing while it was still ongoing, delivering angry denunciations of the majority and its decision to sprint ahead.Among those walking out were Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Kamala Harris, Mazie Hirono, and Sheldon Whitehouse. The protest created a televised split screen, while senior panel Republicans sang Kavanaugh\u0027s statements in prepared statements, while Democrats delivered finger-pointing attacks on the majority outside.Mark Judge IS available for speeches and interviews says his...\u0027You\u0027re telling me that my assault doesn\u0027t matter!\u0027 Dramatic...\u0027I was pissed\u0027: Lindsey Graham recounts his angry...Share this article    Republican senators say the Judiciary Committee plans to vote Friday morning on Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination to the Supreme Court\u0027He volunteers in the community,\u0027 said senior Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah, while Democrats fumed outside the room.  \u0027I\u0027m sure a lot of people are irritated right now and I\u0027ll let express that irritation, said Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the committee chairman.\u0027We are an arm and a very weak arm of the Trump White House,\u0027 complained Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont.  Harris tweeted: \u0027Setting a vote on Kavanaugh less than 24 hours after yesterday\u0027s testimony shows what a sham this process has been. I just refused to vote and walked out.\u0027During the final hours before the Friday afternoon vote, senators took turns saying their piece.LINDSEY GRAHAM: I WILL NOT SHUT UPAfter an explosive intervention on Thursday, Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, doubled down.\u0027I know I\u0027m a single white male from South Carolina, and I\u0027m told I should shut up, but I will not shut up, if that\u0027s OK. Because I got here the same way anyone else did,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m going to vote yes, and I\u0027m going to tell his two daughters that I\u0027m proud of your dad, and I really, really believe he\u0027s a good man. And I\u0027m going to tell Dr. Ford I am sorry you had to go through this, too.\u0027 He added: \u0027I do believe something happened to her. I don\u0027t know when and where, but it wasn\u0027t Brett Kavanaugh.\u0027 Graham called the allegations against Kavanaugh a case which would be impossible to prosecute \u0027in Maryland or anywhere else\u0027, saying it \u0027wouldn\u0027t get out of the batter\u0027s box\u0027.And he called the handling of the allegations \u0027the beginning of a process that will tear this country apart..\u0027And if I am chairman next year, if we keep the majority and Senator Grassley moves over, I’m going to remember this,\u0027 he added.\u0027If you try to destroy somebody you will not get away with it.\u0027 REPUBLICAN JOHN CORYNYN: RIGHT NOT TO CALL MARK JUDGESen. John Cornyn of Texas defended the decision not to call Mark Judge to testify. \u0027He submitted his statement under penalty of felony,\u0027 said Corynyn.\u0027He admits to being a recovering alcoholic as well as a cancer survivor. He said he struggles with depression and anxiety, so much that he avoids public speaking. And our colleagues across the aisle believe that the appropriate course of conduct is to drag Mr. Judge into this circus-like atmosphere and to subject his battle with alcoholism and addiction to public investigation and scrutiny and ridicule.\u0027\u0027That is cruel, that is reckless. That is indecent,\u0027 said Corynyn.DEMOCRAT SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: \u0027PARTISAN SCREED\u0027 Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse brought up his interrogation of Kavanaugh about his high school yearbook entry, suggesting the nominee provided less than truthful explanations.  \u0027His partisan screed yesterday was telling,\u0027 said Whitehouse.\u0027As to yesterday, let me be frank. I believe Dr. Ford. I may be wrong but I believed her. And I believe Kavanaugh dodged and dissembled, ranted and raved, filibustered and prevaricated. I did not find him credible. I don\u0027t believe \u0027boof\u0027 is flatulence, I don\u0027t believe the \u0027Devil\u0027s Triangle\u0027 is a drinking game and I don\u0027t believe calling yourself a girl\u0027s \u0027alumnius\u0027 is being her friend. And I think drinking til you \u0027ralph\u0027 or fall out of the bus or don\u0027t remember the game or need to piece together your memory the next day is more consistent with dr. ford\u0027s and others\u0027 testimony than his own,\u0027 Whitehouse said.\u0027If Dr. Ford\u0027s testimony is true I hope we can all agree Kavanaugh has no business on the court and I for one believed her. But set aside my own belief. \u0027As a prosecutor, I am horrified at what the committee has done. Terminating the FBI background investigation before these new allegations were even considered. Doing partisan interviews by partisan staffers declaredly determined to force the nominee through. \u0027Letting Kavanaugh\u0027s alleged accomplice in the assault, the guy in the room with him when it happened, get away with a lawyer\u0027s letter and no testimony, no cross examination?\u0027 Whitehouse added.             The news comes after a nearly 8-hour day that saw both Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh take the stand in what was an emotional hearing before the Senate Judiciary CommitteeJEFF FLAKE - I WILL VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH Flake issued a definitive statement after leaving both sides guessing with his vague speech at Thursday\u0027s tense hearing.\u0027After hearing more than 30 hours of testimony from Judge Kavanaugh earlier this month, I was prepared to support his nomination based on his view of the law and his record as a judge. In fact, I commented at the time that had he been nominated in another era, he would have likely received 90+ votes,\u0027 Flake said.He then referenced Ford\u0027s allegations of sexual assault.\u0027When Dr. Ford\u0027s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh surfaced two weeks ago, I insisted that she be allowed to testify before the committee moved to a vote. Yesterday, we heard compelling testimony from Dr. Ford, as well as a persuasive response from Judge Kavanaugh,\u0027 Flake said.\u0027I wish that I could express the confidence that some of my colleagues have conveyed about what either did or did not happen in the early 1980s, but I left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty.\u0027\u0027What I do know is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us to the rule of law. While some may argue that a different standard should apply regarding the Senate\u0027s advice and consent responsibilities, I believe that the constitution\u0027s provisions of fairness and due process apply here as well,\u0027 Flake said.\u0027I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh,\u0027 Flake concluded.As the panel met Friday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal immediately moved to subpoena Kavanaugh friend Mark Judge. Blasey Ford claims Judge was present during the alleged assault. Judge never appeared before the panel or met with the FBI, although panel chair Charles Grassley of Iowa read a letter by Judge\u0027s lawyer.\u0027The ram job continues,\u0027 said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse.    Blumenthal said of Judge as the tense hearing began: \u0027Evidently he has never been interviewed by the FBI. He has never been questioned by any member of our committee. He has never submitted a detailed account of what he knows.\u0027\u0027He has submitted a cursory, conclusory 6-sentence letter,\u0027 Blumenthal complained. \u0027We cannot in good conscience, vote without hearing at least from Mark Judge ... We should hear from the other sexual assault survivors who have come forward with incredible and powerful stories.\u0027 Within minutes of the conclusion of the riveting Senate hearing, Republicans announced that the Judiciary Committee would meet Friday morning for a vote on Kavanaugh\u0027s confirmation.Kavanaugh is expected to clear a committee roll call. But even if he doesn\u0027t, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will start turning the Senate\u0027s wheels with a procedural floor vote as early as Saturday.Key holdouts huddled in the Capitol on Thursday evening, including SusanCollins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona.West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, facing a difficult re-election fight in a deep-red Trump state, has sent signals that he could vote with Republicans.If not, Republicans could withstand just a single defection if they want to confirm Kavanaugh, who has emphatically denied Ford\u0027s allegations.Other Democrats sitting on the fence as of Friday morning included Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Bill Nelson of Florida. All three are looking to avoid alienating Republican voters in advance of the midterm election just weeks away. Flake, a retiring Arizona lawmaker who has crossed swords with Trump, failed to question wither Kavanaugh or Ford during Thursday\u0027s Judiciary Committee hearing – instead delivering an equivocating speech.\u0027I\u0027m sorry for what\u0027s happened to you and your family. I\u0027m sorry for what has happened to hers. This is not a good process, but it\u0027s all we\u0027ve got,\u0027 Flake said.After the hearing Flake said it was a \u0027tough call\u0027 on whether he would support Kavanaugh, saying Ford\u0027s account was \u0027compelling\u0027 but lacked \u0027corroboration from those who were there.\u0027Asked how he would vote, Flake only said \u0027let me process it.\u0027 \u0027There have been no decisions,\u0027 Manchin reportedly said outside the hearing room. \u0027There are some concerns that people have, and we\u0027re going to try to close the loop.\u0027  While Flake is the only senator among the four who is a member of the Judiciary Committee, all are considered key to determining Kavanaugh\u0027s ultimate fate if his nomination were to reach a full vote in the Senate.They talked for around 30 minutes before Thursday night\u0027s GOP conference meeting.Former President George W. Bush personally reached out to all four senators, including Manchin, hoping to help sway them to Kavanaugh\u0027s side, according to The Washington Post. The former president has a long history with Kavanaugh, who worked for him during the crucial Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2003.Meanwhile, moderate Democratic Sen. Doug Jones revealed Thursday night that he would oppose Kavanaugh\u0027s Supreme Court bid.The Alabama senator, who defeated right-winger Roy Moore in a bellwether special election last year, called the nomination process \u0027flawed from the beginning\u0027 and said he found Ford to be both credible and courageous. Jones added that he was concerned voting \u0027yes\u0027 on Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination would send a bad message to sons, daughters, and victims of sexual assault.   Several Senate Republicans likewise acknowledged Ford\u0027s \u0027credibility.\u0027 But GOP leadership from still scheduled a Judiciary Committee meeting and Friday vote immediately after the end of Kavanaugh\u0027s testimony.          Three Republicans (Collins, Murkowski and Flake) and five Democrats (Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin, Nelson and Tester) are thought to be \u0027in play\u0027 and could switch sides when a final Kavbanaugh vote is called on the Senate floor          Kavanaugh and his wife Ashley Estes Kavanaugh, hold hands as they leave a holding room after the hearing on Thursday           Trump tweeted his support for Kavanaugh just minutes after the 8-hour hearing came to an end on Thursday nightShocking moment police drag couple to the floor at Tesco storeDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingHorrific moment tsunami crashes into Palu beach in IndonesiaIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushHorrifying moment man breaks his neck in bucks party prankTheresa May rules out General Election before Britain leaves EUHandcuffed Bill Cosby gets loaded into a police vehicleOwner wrecks truck while trying to take it back from tow truckTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica HermanShocking moment police drag couple to the floor at Tesco storeDavid Beckham\u0027s lawyer Nick Freeman arrives at court hearingHorrific moment tsunami crashes into Palu beach in IndonesiaIncredible moment seal slaps a kayaker in the face with an octopusSheffield school shut down after mass brawl breaks out on siteHilarious moment man fails to get in car after giving it a pushHorrifying moment man breaks his neck in bucks party prankTheresa May rules out General Election before Britain leaves EUHandcuffed Bill Cosby gets loaded into a police vehicleOwner wrecks truck while trying to take it back from tow truckTiger Woods attends Ryder Cup Gala dinner with Erica Herman\u0027It was not related to sex,\u0027 he said bluntly. \u0027I\u0027m so sorry for her for that yearbook reference,\u0027 he added, choking up as he proclaimed: \u0027She was and is a great person.\u0027Sen Richard Blumenthal brought up the yearbook statement again later in the hearing, referencing Dolphin\u0027s own quote to the Times that the \u0027Alumni\u0027 joke was \u0027horrible, hurtful, and simply untrue\u0027.\u0027Renate Alumni clearly implied some boast of sexual conquest,\u0027 Blumenthal added.   Kavanaugh became agitated at the senator\u0027s suggestion, instead trying to claim it was Blumenthal who was doing \u0027great harm\u0027 to Dolphin, despite the fact he was referencing her own direct quote regarding  the yearkbook.\u0027You\u0027re just dragging her through the mud,\u0027 Kavanaugh said. What was not addressed during the hearing was the fact that Kavanaugh\u0027s lawyer claimed he shared a kiss with Dolphin after an event, to which she specifically told the New York Times never actually happened.On Thursday Kavanaugh also reiterated a claim he made during his Fox News interview on Monday that he was a virgin in high school and for years afterward.\u0027This is not a topic I ever imagined would come up in a judicial confirmation hearing,\u0027 he said. \u0027I never had sexual intercourse or anything close to it during high school or for many years after that.\u0027Kavanaugh also admitted he liked beer and still likes beer, but added it doesn\u0027t mean he sexually assaulted anyone.\u0027I liked beer. I still like beer. But I never drank beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted someone,\u0027 he said.He then issued a warning that attempted to tie his sexual assault allegations to the fate of any young American who enjoys beer.          Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin  exits after meeting privately with Republican Senators Jeff Flake, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski following the hearing. The four are considered the key holdouts that could block Kavanaugh\u0027s nomination\u0027If every American who drank beer in high school is suddenly presumed guilty of sexual assault we are in a new place in this country,\u0027 he proclaimed. Whether Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking was a frequent topic of discussion during the hearing, as he continued to claim he was far too focused on his football practice to ever do such a thing on weekdays in the summer.Yet later in the hearing, Kavanaugh had to concede to  Booker  that on July 1 - a weekday - he had \u0027brewskis\u0027 with his friends after a football practice. The proof was in his much-discussed calendar. \u0027You drank on weekdays, yes or no?\u0027 Booker asked. \u0027Well, yes...on July 1,\u0027 Kavanaugh replied. Blumenthal also brought up how Kavanaugh had once described needing to \u0027piece things back together\u0027 after \u0027falling off the bus on to the front steps of the Law School at 4.45am\u0027 while he was a law student at Yale.   Her voice quavered as she described her trauma following the house party where she claims Kavanaugh attacked her as Judge watched.\u0027I don\u0027t have all the answers, and I don\u0027t remember as much as I would like to,\u0027 she said. \u0027But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.\u0027 \u0027When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom.

It is very like an earlier painting now in Berlin and art historians have been arguing about them both for years.Both paintings ostensibly show the infant Jesus in the temple. The one at the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin, is agreed to be the work of Andrea Mantegna. The Venetian painting, made 20 years later, was credited to Mantegna also. But it is now accepted as by Giovanni Bellini.There is something unnerving about seeing it so close up on its easel the black background, the heads packed together, the baby as tightly swaddled as a chrysalis – apart from his poor little fingertips.Recently, an experiment was carried out in the former palace in Venice – a heart-stopping moment for Caroline Campbell. She is the curator of an exhibition at the National Gallery in London that will bring the two paintings together again in the first show to directly compare the work of both men. (The origins of the exhibition lie in the years she has spent puzzling over two more related works – Mantegna and Bellini’s versions of The Agony in the Garden, which have hung together in London since the 19th century.)A tracing of the Berlin Jesus painting on an acetate sheet was overlaid on to the Venice version. The six central figures matched exactly. “Anyone with eyes could see that there was a relationship between the two artists,” said Campbell, “but this was the first solid evidence of one man working directly from the other.”The relationship between the two men was well known. They were both giants of 15th-century Italian art: one, the stroppy son of a carpenter from a tiny village outside Padua the other, a mild-mannered Venetian born into the city’s most acclaimed family of artists.Bellini’s precise birth and death dates, where he lived and the exact site of his grave are not known, though he lived to the great age of 86 and died in Venice, rich and revered. A prodigy apprenticed as a child to a Paduan artist, Mantegna is less elusive because he was an argumentative soul and his life can be tracked in legal actions. He went to court to escape adoption by the master who trained him but wouldn’t pay him against a wealthy patron who felt he’d cheated her on the number of angels in her altar piece or, when he thought a studio assistant was stealing his ideas.Furthermore, Mantegna married Bellini’s sister Nicolosia – a beauty, if she was, as is presumed, the model for the Virgin. The match was probably made by her father Jacopo to bring the brilliant young man, already more famous than either of Jacopo’s artist sons Giovanni and Gentile, into his workshop without having to pay him. Although the two families remained in contact, Jacopo lost his prize when Mantegna accepted an invitation to become court painter to the Dukes of Mantua.While the Bellinis prospered in Venice, in later years Mantegna’s extravagant lifestyle, and problems with actually getting paid his princely salary, meant that he died in poverty near the church where he is buried, long after the sale of the extraordinary house he designed and built. It is still standing, although now a shell in use as a contemporary art gallery.His Jesus in the Temple painting may have been made to mark his marriage to Nicolosia and the hope of a child. Campbell believes that Bellini may have recreated it, incorporating more family portraits to mark the death of his father, Jacopo.The exhibition studies the relationship between their work and the extent to which they inspired, borrowed from, or even directly imitated one another. Campbell attributes to Mantegna the dramatic black backgrounds, which bring out the sculptural qualities of the figures in many of the smaller works the audacious experiments in perspective and foreshortening and his fascination with the architecture of classical Rome and Greece. (Roman fragments burst through the soil of Padua at every street corner.) She gives Bellini the prize for suffusing his paintings with light and for creating emotional warmth even when he was borrowing the figures from his brother-in-law or his father’s notebooks.As to which was the greater, visitors will be joining an argument now more than five centuries old. The 16th-century biographer Giorgio Vasari called Mantegna “praiseworthy in all his actions”, and predicted “his memory will ever live not only in his own country but in the whole world”.In 1504, a Venetian art dealer wrote to Isabella d’Este, patron of both artists: “Nobody can beat Mr Andrea Mantegna for invention in which he is the height of excellence … but in colour Giovanni Bellini is excellent.” Albrecht Dürer, a jealous assessor of the genius of other artists, wrote of Bellini, who was then working aged about 90, “still he is the best painter of them all”.Campbell keeps her counsel on the ancient debate, but there may be a clue in her intake of breath on a recent visit to the wondrous Bellini altarpiece in the Frari in Venice – the honeyed light in which the figures stand magnified by the golden rays of an autumn afternoon pouring in, as Bellini intended, from a tall window in the side wall. It is one of the masterpieces she never contemplated borrowing for the exhibition. “I don’t think this picture has ever left this space – and I hope it never will. It is just perfection.“To admire one is not to take from the other,” Campbell says firmly. “Mantegna for invention, Bellini for light, both are wonderful.”• Mantegna and Bellini is at the National Gallery, London, 1 October-27 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5f654603300e56df8b7ab96369cffdeaa3b854/0_0_2362_2362/master/2362.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=44dd27c669de62dcd302bd60e649779b 1760w","title":"paul trevor ping pong portraitist in pictures","story":"Using the fast-moving skills he honed as a table tennis champ, Paul Trevor wandered through London’s financial district and a market in Brick Lane, taking spontaneous closeups.

A grave philosopher or a grim sort of comedian? A cosmopolitan lady’s man or a profound, ascetic seeker? Jew or Buddhist? Hedonist or hermit? Across his 82 years, the Montreal-born Leonard Cohen was all of these things – and in his posthumous book of poetry, given the Lawrentian title The Flame by his son Adam, all sides of the man are present.Other than that, Adam Cohen won’t say much more. “This was all private,” he says, sitting in an office on Los Angeles’s Wilshire Boulevard, near the house where his dad passed away after a late-night fall almost two years ago. “My father was very interested in preserving the magic of his process. And moreover, not demystifying it. Speaking of any of this,” he says, his voice dropping to a whisper, “is a transgression.” But after a few more remarks – stressing that Cohen wrote entirely in solitude, that he would consider discussion of his work a dangerous sort of “vanity” – Adam describes his late father, his sense of himself, and the heart of his achievement reasonably well.“It’s all song, and it’s all poetry – for him there wasn’t any delineation,” he says of the decades of wrestling over the nature of his father’s gift. To Cohen himself, though, it was never enough. “He’d call himself slow,” Adam says. “He’d write poems about how Leonard Cohen was a lazy bastard living in a suit.” In fact, Cohen was a fierce perfectionist, devoted to an almost impossible level of rigour, and the bearer of what his son calls “a monastic discipline”.Adam nods toward a finished copy of the book: “This is what he was staying alive for.” Cohen had leukaemia, and dropped hints about his impending demise on You Want It Darker, his final album. (“I’m leaving the table  I’m out of the game,” he sings on one of its tracks.)“He was a man on a quest, on a mission,” Adam says, describing his father’s increasing sense of purpose and dedication in his last months, which included sending “do not disturb” emails to friends and family so he could finish the project. “That probably bought him some time on Earth.”Countless rock singers, from folkies to CBGBs punks, have been lazily dubbed “poetic” but Cohen was, by any measure, the real thing: he published no fewer than four books of verse, across a decade, before the release of his first LP, the mostly acoustic, finger-picked Songs of Leonard Cohen, which led off with the undeniably poetic “Suzanne”. (Oddly, he actually made early forays into music as a teenager, forming a country-folk band with friends called the Buckskin Boys, but he largely let music drop until the release of his debut at age 33.) Those first poems emerged from a close-knit group of Canadian versifiers reading stanzas to each other in cafes and flats, printing mimeographed copies. “There were no prizes or grants or awards,” Cohen said in a 1993 radio interview. “There weren’t even any girls.” It seems appropriate that his last words – despite the power of You Want It Darker, released just weeks before his death – would come in the form of a posthumous book of verse.As a young man, Cohen’s favourite poet was perhaps Federico García Lorca he’d later name his daughter after the doomed Spaniard. But his sense of the art stretched back thousands of years and great writing would, he knew, outlive what he saw as his own meagre contributions. “He could recite to the letter,” Adam says. “Byron, Shakespeare, Rumi, the Bible … The guy was outrageously fluent.” Cohen once said his training, and sense of vocation, went back to Robert Burns, the French troubadours, Homer and King David. Adam calls his style “mytho-romantic,” which seems as good a term as any.Cohen was an exacting reader of the verse of others. In 2005, he sued his longtime business manager, a decade or so after she began taking his money. “He didn’t know where the accountant was cheating,” Adam says. “But you could present him with a poem, and he could tell where the poet was cheating.” For Cohen, faking it was not an option: his own work, Adam says, “was a mandate from God”.In the same way it’s hard to imagine Cohen with even an untucked shirt – in later life he almost always appeared in full suit and tie, typically with brimmed hat and leather shoes – it’s difficult to conceive of an unfinished song, a number that would have been improved with an additional verse, or played in a different key.For his final publication, he left almost nothing to chance. Unlike, say, the mass of work, unfinished and otherwise, that often appears after a writer or musician dies – the endless songs and demos authorised by the Jimi Hendrix estate, for instance, or the obsessive mining of Tolkien’s Middle-earth – The Flame shows the emphasis Cohen put on distillation. “Nothing about this book,” Adam says, “is haphazard.”Though Cohen came up during the beat era and admired Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, the cult of spontaneity never appealed to him. (“That’s never worked for me,” he said in 1993. “My first thoughts are dull, are prejudiced, are poisonous. I find last thought, best thought.”)The Flame is ided, as per Cohen’s instructions, into three sections, and organised by editors Robert Faggen and Alexandra Pleshoyano, scholars in California and Quebec respectively. The first is a selection of 63 poems, some of which have been published before, going back several decades. Adam calls the first, “Happens to the Heart,” the “blueprint” of the entire collection. Most of it is in rhyme and metre at least half could be described as light verse.The second section reprints the lyrics (sometimes differing from their recorded versions) from Cohen’s last three albums, plus “Blue Alert”, a 2006 recording by his former backing vocalist and romantic partner Anjani Thomas. (Cohen produced and wrote the lyrics.) On the page, the poise and polish of these songs remain striking.The third part is a selection from Cohen’s notebooks – distilled from more than 3,000 pages across roughly 60 years, up to and including, apparently, the day he died. A 2001 acceptance speech for a Spanish award serves as a brief coda. (There is also an email exchange with a friend even his online correspondence seems to be in rhyme and metre.)Included in various proportions are love, sex, death, regret, exaltation, piety and gentle fondness. The blending of the earthy with the spiritual – in his last years Cohen was as influenced by a Hindu teacher as much as the Buddhist guru he studied with on a California mountain – would give John Donne and Marvin Gaye a run for their money.Throughout the book are sketches by Cohen, mostly self-portraits, with a few, unsurprisingly, of musical instruments and topless women. Even as the body failed, the flame of Cohen’s libido seemed to continue burning.While the notebooks are uneven, reading them makes for a bittersweet experience: it’s hard not to see these as the seeds of Cohen songs we never got to hear, finished poems we’ll never get to read.But Cohen never rushed his output, and could go almost a decade between albums. This wasn’t because ideas and images didn’t flow: he apparently filled notebooks every day of his life, and Adam describes finding them, as a child, in the poet’s desk drawers and jacket pockets, even, later, while seeking a bottle of tequila, coming upon a chilled, forgotten notebook in the freezer.This is an artist who worked on a single song – what would become “Hallelulah” – for several years, writing 80 drafts and as many verses, only to have it rejected by his record label. (The final, much shorter, version became, after covers by John Cale and Jeff Buckley, Cohen’s most recorded song.)He wasn’t, then, one to dash things off. Despite the generous and world-weary humour that emerged in his last decades, – his early, folkie work was denounced as “humourless” –the task of writing was deadly serious. He surely knew the line from Yeats – a poet he deeply admired – about how “The intellect of man is forced to choose  Perfection of the life, or of the work.” On this wager, Cohen was unambiguous.“Religion, teachers, women, drugs, the road, fame, money,” Adam quotes his father saying “nothing gets me high and offers relief from the suffering like blackening pages, writing.” It was also, he writes in his foreword, “a statement of regret”, since Cohen sacrificed so much – he never married, considered himself a poor father, let his health and financial state decline – for the Muse. Amidst numerous liaisons and botched relationships, poetry is the one thing he remained entirely faithful to. The Flame is the incontrovertible proof.I was always working steady But I never called it artI was funding my depression Meeting Jesus reading Marx Sure it failed my little fire But it’s bright the dying spark Go tell the young messiah What happens to the heartThere’s a mist of summer kisses Where I tried to double-park The rivalry was viciousAnd the women were in charge It was nothing, it was business But it left an ugly markSo I’ve come here to revisit What happens to the heartI was selling holy trinketsI was dressing kind of sharp Had a pussy in the kitchen And a panther in the yardIn the prison of the giftedI was friendly with the guard So I never had to witness What happens to the heartI should have seen it comingYou could say I wrote the chart Just to look at her was troubleIt was trouble from the startSure we played a stunning couple But I never liked the partIt ain’t pretty, it ain’t subtleWhat happens to the heartNow the angel’s got a fiddle And the devil’s got a harpEvery soul is like a minnow Every mind is like a sharkI’ve opened every windowBut the house, the house is dark Just say Uncle, then it’s simple What happens to the heartI was always working steadyBut I never called it artThe slaves were there already The singers chained and charred Now the arc of justice bending And the injured soon to marchI lost my job defending What happens to the heartI studied with this beggarHe was filthy he was scarred By the claws of many women He had failed to disregard No fable here no lessonNo singing meadowlarkJust a filthy beggar blessing What happens to the heartI was always working steady But I never called it artI could lift, but nothing heavy Almost lost my union cardI was handy with a rifleMy father’s .303We fought for something final Not the right to disagreeSure it failed my little fireBut it’s bright the dying spark Go tell the young messiah What happens to the heartover Reykjavik, the “smokey bay”\u0026nbspwhere W.H.

First, Italy is the third biggest economy in the eurozone after Germany and France. Second, its banking system is fragile after two decades in which the economy has posted precious little growth. And third, it has a new populist government – a coalition of the League and the Five Star Movement – with a radical agenda that includes raising pensions and introducing a basic income.Yes. The Italian banking system is seriously burdened with bad debts and that has meant its capacity to lend has been impaired. Low interest rates and the money creation programme known as quantitative easing have had much less of an impact in Italy than elsewhere in the eurozone. If monetary policy – interest rates and QE – is not working, there is an argument for fiscal policy – taxes and spending – to play a bigger role in generating demand. Stronger growth should eventually lead to higher tax revenues and a low deficit.Italian banks have been big buyers of the bonds sold by the government, and their financial position becomes shakier if those bonds go down in value. The markets are worried about a “doom loop” of weak growth, a rising deficit, losses on bonds and failing banks. They fear, also, that Italy’s problems will spill over into the rest of the eurozone, since banks in other countries – most notably, France – are big holders of Italian debt.Not yet, but all the ingredients are there. The comment by Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister, that jobs and pensions matter more to him than the views of “EU bureaucrats” shows that Rome and Brussels are on a collision course at a time when the eurozone economy is slowing and financial markets are jumpy.

But the government’s removal of its cap on funded undergraduate numbers has allowed universities in England to expand and aggressively compete for students and their tuition fees.While there is little recent evidence to show whether pupils with unconditional offers achieve disappointing final grades, private school heads have long been hostile because of the potential impact on their school’s results and league table rankings.Some employers pay close attention to A-level grades in recruiting for graduate trainee programmes, meaning that students who underperform may later struggle in the job market.The HMC’s call follows that of Sam Gyimah, the higher education minister, who said in July that the rise in unconditional offers was “completely irresponsible to students, and universities must start taking a lead by limiting the number they offer”.In most cases, universities make conditional offers, detailing specific A-level grades that applicants need to achieve to take up a place . However, greater competition has seen the use of unconditional offers spread to universities in the more selective Russell Group of research-intensive institutions.Ucas said the offers were more common for older students who already held qualifications, to creative arts course applicants who submit portfolios or attend auditions, and for students with mental health difficulties.Vice-chancellors have defended unconditional offers as allowing earlier engagement between universities and students, and making it easier to plan courses and accommodation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb42c6815d3bc6c4cd277acb9e79685867f61c4/0_0_3888_2592/master/3888.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99342a40ab2af3a6a9a5c344a0bbdec8 1010w","title":"celine and the mystery of the vandalised posters","story":"Celine’s new creative director, Hedi Slimane, shows his first collection – but why has the brand’s advertising been defaced?Earlier this month, Celine’s newly appointed creative director, Hedi Slimane, announced the start of his tenure at the French fashion house by doing two things that say a lot about how fashion works in 2018.Firstly, he deleted the brand’s official Instagram account. Secondly, he changed the logo, principally finessing the spacing between the letters and dropping the acute accent over the e. Céline became Celine. “RIP Céline”, they wrote. And then came a mass defacement of posters in which the acute accent was reinstated.The posters for the new Celine campaign – glowing models with bobs, and gold foil curtains – were on every street corner. But few went unmarked. Some were streaked with a Sharpie, some scratched with a sharp object. One in Milan appeared to have been marked with blood (though on closer inspection it was more likely paint). And then in the run-up to Paris fashion week, where on Friday Slimane will show his first collection since taking over, a rash of other fashion labels apparently papered over Celine’s posters. In turn, Celine papered over them.New designers often tweak old logos. Slimane had already changed the YSL logo to Saint Laurent when he worked there in 2013. And for a fan of industrial design, Slimane’s decision to create a new logo hinged around proportion which also paid homage to the original 1960s version, wasn’t exactly a surprise. Raf Simons rejigged the Calvin Klein logo, Balenciaga’s was slightly reworked by Demna Gvasalia and Diane von Furstenberg’s logo was changed by Jonathan Saunders in 2017. In August, Burberry’s new head Riccardo Tisci launched a pop art version of the logo designed with Peter Savile. Incidents of Burberry posters being papered over have also been reported.And yet the reaction to Celine’s missing accent hit a nerve, eventually prompting linguists to question its necessity in the first place. During the 1960s there was no accent on Celine, nor was there one during Michael Kors’ term in the early 00s.The truth is, it was never really needed. One French colleague explained: “It doesn’t affect the word or its pronunciation, it looks like it’s purely a stylistic decision in order to change the logo and font. He added: “Spelling and accents seem to have lost their importance in France anyway.”Pfeiffer thinks this form of brandalism – in which logos or brands are deliberately (and often artfully) vandalised – could be part of a wider anti-imperialist movement, starting with culture: “La Femme, Juliette Armanet and lots of bands chose to sing in French only – there is a return to chanson Française.” All this after accusations that the government is dumbing down the French language by removing accents – two years ago #JeSuisCirconflexe campaigners criticised the Académie Française for changing more than 2,400 words.These theories have weight, though it’s more likely the motive was purely sentimental. In this case, the departure of Phoebe Philo and the appointment of Slimane.

Fresh from its sojourn to Seoul earlier this month, where it showed off its latest see-now, buy-now collection, the brand popped up in Paris on Wednesday. It’s all a part of its push “to show the brand in different countries and to become more known”, according to creative director Johnny Coca, who joined the heritage house famous for its much imitated Bayswater and Alexa handbags in 2015.When it comes to the collections, however, the UK is a regular source of inspiration for Coca. Whereas in previous collections he has explored rebellious and aristocratic icons, the springsummer 2019 collection shown in Paris this week drew from the swinging sixties, a period “of freedom, emancipation and revolution”, according to the designer. Psychedelic prints and patent rain macs with big buttons were met with multicoloured platforms and go go boots – the uniform of starlets such as Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton and their imitators on Carnaby Street and King’s Road. “The 60s is one of the strongest moments in the UK for music, art, design and the power of the girls. They took the power and decided how they wanted to be.”This ode also comes at the same time as a pressing concern for Mulberry: the implications of Brexit. Despite it being the market leader in leather goods and having its own production line based in Bath and Somerset, the company is limited in terms of the materials it can source and so relies upon mainland Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6733788c8e9c755ff25034f71e0baf15807c632/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=997ca559d44027e60591e6ec9ad8b849","title":"rose mcgowan apology asia argento","story":"Fallout over sexual assault accusations appears to be at an end after McGowan says she regrets ‘not correcting mistakes sooner’The actor and activist Rose McGowan has issued an apology to Asia Argento after the latter threatened legal action over what she termed “horrendous lies” in connection with sexual assault allegations made against Argento by the actor Jimmy Bennett.McGowan said that her most “serious” mistake was to allege that Bennett had sent explicit text messages to Argento when he was 12 years old and that Argento had not acted appropriately on receiving them. McGowan said she had “misunderstood the messages that Asia exchanged with my partner Rain Dove”.Argento had on 17 September given McGowan 24 hours to apologise before, the following day, saying she had instructed lawyers Mishcon de Reya to “seek substantial damages for deception, fraud, coercion and libel”. However, Argento appears to have accepted McGowan’s apology, posting a message on Twitter in response reading: “Although I am grateful to @rosemcgowan for her full apology following her groundless allegations about me, if she had issued it earlier, I may have kept my job on X-Factor and avoided the constant accusations of paedophilia which I have been subjected to in real-life and online.”Argento then followed it up by posting: “Now go on, live your life and stop hurting other people, will you Rose? Best wishes.”The confrontation between two prominent figures in the Harvey Weinstein scandal arose after Argento was accused of sexual assault by actor Jimmy Bennett in a New York Times article in August. Bennett claimed she had paid him $380,000 (£290,000) to keep the accusation quiet. Argento has denied the assault allegation, and claims her then partner Anthony Bourdain paid the money to Bennett to help him with “severe economic problems”.Police in Los Angeles are investigating Bennett’s claim after it emerged no report to police had been made at the time of the alleged assault in 2013.

In January 2009 it was reported that Nottingham Forest had agreed a deal to take Bale on loan with an option to buy only for him to say that he wanted to stay and fight for his place.Bale, who is now at Real Madrid, would break through at Tottenham in January 2010 and go on to become one of their finest players – his move from left-back to left wing was key – but Pochettino said that the club had simply lucked out with him.“In football, sometimes something appears but it’s so lucky. Yes or no? That’s the truth! Come on, after four years, we know each other and we need to be honest.”Damien Comolli, the club’s sporting director between 2005-2008, is on record as saying that Harry Redknapp, who took over as the manager in October 2008, “tried to get rid of Bale” while Clive Allen, who was on the coaching staff, said: “It did go pretty close. I know that the clubs had agreed the potential of the move. It got to the stage where it was Gareth’s decision to stay and fight.”Redknapp has always strenuously denied that he wanted to move Bale on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bde53bfab45f752f0423461a10de1c7b166975/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f40f06a7976a63d80404621f00899d","title":"nine simple ways to revamp your workspace for a healthier environment","story":"Improving your posture at work, adding some greenery to your desk and moving to a window seat are just some of the quick fixes that can transform your productivityThere’s a lot more to happiness in the workplace than a comfortable salary. In fact, working more than 40 hours a week may well be doing you a considerable disservice and directly affecting your health and performance at work. Thankfully, taking a few minutes of your day and deploying intelligent fixes can turn your office from a dreary workspace to an area that transforms your productivity and mindset. Here are nine ways you can make your office work for you.Take a standThere’s a reason standing desks – no longer the reserve of agile Silicon Roundabout startups – are quickly making their way into the offices of multinationals. Encouraging employees to be considerably more aware of their posture at work, adjustable desks and workstations such as Varidesk and the Yo-Yo desk are quickly becoming adopted by offices across the UK. What’s more, sitting for more than six hours a day leaves you at greater risk of anxiety and depression, according to the Association for Psychological Science – meaning that an eight-hour day spent on your rear quickly becomes an unhealthy habit.Spring cleaningOld meeting notes, dirty mugs, empty sandwich boxes and a dirty keyboard all add up to an unhappy desk. According to a study by Princeton Neuroscience Institute, “multiple visual stimuli” – also known as unwelcome desk clutter – compete for attention in your brain, meaning you can remove distraction with a desk free of unnecessary mess. Similarly, you’ll want to give your keyboard a wipe-down every week or so, as the average keyboard has 20,000 times more bacteria than a toilet seat.Stretch it outStressful experiences – at work and at home – have the potential to age the human brain by four years, according to a 2017 study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association’s conference. Thankfully, you can de-stress and fight poor posture at your desk by working through this stretching routine. To open up your back, bring your hands behind you and press your palms together. Bring your elbows back and downwards, slowly tucking your chin – hold the stretch for 30 seconds and repeat three times. Consider this your first step to become a more supple – and pain-free – human.Make a moveFor now, there are no stringent laws on taking screen breaks, but the Health and Safety Executive recommends a five- to 10-minute break every hour. Standing up and walking around will help stretch your body, adjust your posture and increase productivity and attention, as well as the quality of your work.Give yourself a handSpending 35-plus hours at a desk each week is hardly appealing, the very real prospect of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) – a condition in which a nerve in your wrist is under pressure, causing numb hands, weakness and tingling – is far worse. Common in men and women over 40 years old, CTS stems from repetitive actions such as using a mouse and keyboard. Handily, ergonomic office equipment – Microsoft Surface and Mac-friendly Kinesis Freestyle are two of the UK’s most popular options – can help stave CTS off. The oddly shaped equipment improves forearm posture, adds comfort and supports your hands. You’ll agree that it’ll be worth a few odd looks.Thirsty workWorkplace absence in the UK is costing £18bn annually, according to analysis from Centre of Economic and Business Research. That’s a total of 168m working days lost annually. While there’s no sole reason for this, it’s important to adopt everyday habits to keep you as healthy as possible in the workplace. Dehydration, for example, even at a mild level, directly affects both physical and mental performance, meaning that you’ll find it hard to concentrate during work hours and struggle with that post-work run. Women should aim for two litres a day, and men for three litres.Light workIf constantly feeling tired is making office life a miserable reality, it could be because of the light levels in your office. A 2013 study from the Netherlands found that when office workers were exposed to more daylight during the working week, they were less sleepy and considerably more energetic. Similarly, researchers from Turkey found that study participants who had three hours or more of daylight a day felt considerably happier and more satisfied – muting the chance of office burnout. Push for that window desk and reap the rewards immediately.Pain in the neckYour career, rather unfortunately, is wreaking havoc on your neck. A combination of poor posture and stress, which affects your sleep, is likely to be causing unnecessary neck pain. Rarely a sign of something more serious, neck pain can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers such as Voltarol, which can be taken orally or applied directly to the affected area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ace37f5742fa7b02242b994afd8e4db63e8e91/0_6_1555_933/master/1555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d71aa0df02f4feea5014f5a575e75bc","title":"should you delete social media oliver burkeman","story":"When you’re addicted to something, you’re obviously biased in favour of arguments suggesting it’s unrealistic to quitShould you delete your social media accounts right now? The title of Jaron Lanier’s excellent recent polemic, Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, leaves no doubt which side he’s on. His view is that Facebook, Twitter and the rest have sucked us into an addictive spiral of outrage, isolation and extremism, while making it ever harder for those who create the culture off which they leech – musicians, artists, journalists – to make a living.But as this stance grows more popular, so does an objection: for many, it’s impossible. “What #DeleteFacebook tech bros don’t get,” writes the activist Jillian York, is that “leaving is, for many, a luxury they can’t afford”. Like it or not, people now rely on the network to run a business, stay in touch with friends and family, or even maintain their mental health, thanks to online support groups. Telling them to fulfil those needs elsewhere is unrealistic – precisely because everyone else is fulfilling them on Facebook. Being able to walk away is a matter of “privilege”, a Slate essay argues. It’s also another case of lecturing people about the need for self-discipline, when the real problem is capitalism and insufficiently regulated corporations bent on profit.The thorny issue here – when it comes to whether you, personally, should abandon social media – is that the latter viewpoint has plenty of truth to it, yet also serves as a convenient excuse. When you’re addicted to something, you’re obviously biased in favour of arguments suggesting it’s unrealistic to quit. So, while some people may genuinely face social isolation by deleting Facebook, or professional ruin by leaving LinkedIn, chances are you’re not among them – even if you feel pretty sure you are. It’s more likely you’re telling yourself that story to spare yourself being deprived of social media’s comfortably sedative effects, and being left alone with your thoughts instead.Of course, that’s easy for me to say. (And a bit hypocritical, since I’m still on Twitter, and just about still on Facebook.) But that doesn’t make it wrong. Sometimes the glib advice it’s easy for columnists to dispense is the right advice for you, even if you’d rather it weren’t.This is part of a broader hazard, whenever left-leaning people confront the world of self-help: we’re so primed to see things in structural terms – as matters of privilege and power – that we convince ourselves we’re more powerless than we are. Every inidual-level “happiness hack”, from digital detoxes to meditation to therapy, is open to the retort that what we really need is a fairer, more humane society – and self-help just serves to make us more accepting of the status quo. I don’t disagree. But the danger is of what Jean-Paul Sartre called “bad faith”: convincing yourself you lack choices, when actually you don’t, because it’s less scary than facing your freedom.The truth is, you could choose, right now, to jettison social media, or indeed many other unfulfilling aspects of your life. You might choose not to, concluding that the downsides outweigh the upsides in your case. But you do have a choice. Even telling yourself you don’t have a choice is a choice.One of Lanier’s previous books, 2010’s You Are Not A Gadget, makes the prescient case that the web is leading us to “digital Maoism”, a collectivism that undermines iniduality and slides easily into mob rule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980436e5e9f1eea9c3624d34e54c245db1daf05b/0_1155_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f766009d19687900153f79ae0b11b42d","title":"easy feasting spanish spiced roast rack of pork","story":"Smoked paprika and aromatic fennel add fire and flavour to a roasted rack of pork that’s low on effort, high on impact and perfect for sharingOutdoor late summer gatherings don’t always have to mean firing up the barbecue.

The bidding public disagreed and left the group in deficit.They attempted to claw back some cash by including a signed vinyl copy of their Different Class album with a vintage gramophone they were auctioning, but this also raised limited interest from bidders.Cocker, who bucked the show’s traditions by refusing to wear the typical branded polo shirts, said he had been “scarred for life” by his previous attendance at auctions. “I attempted to be in the antiques trade for about a fortnight. It didn’t really work,” he said.The Happy Mondays team ended the programme with a profit of £8 after buying a “vintage rustic novelty mirror” in the shape of a horse collar, a biscuit tin and a mid-century record player. But a member of the Bargain Hunt production crew noticed the winning bidder for two of their lots was Bez’s girlfriend, breaking show rules and forcing the ending to be reshot – with victory handed to Pulp.“It was a genuine error,” said Bez, who was made to pay the £8 profit out of his own pocket. “My girlfriend thought she was helping out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac7e021296cfb953476dd858810a12222b3e901/0_0_3500_2362/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d46efb91eedf0a2ce231a91b145c6f8f 480w","title":"food supplier suggests vegetarian dishes in case of no deal brexit","story":"Bidfood UK may not be able to source meat for care homes, schools, prisons and hospitalsOne of Britain’s biggest food suppliers to pubs, prisons and royal palaces has held talks with customers over switching to vegetarian dishes to avoid meat shortages that could be triggered by a no-deal Brexit.Bidfood UK, which is the sole provider of food served in prisons and also supplies schools, hospitals and care homes, has approached customers about changing their menu choices as part of contingency plans for border delays.With six months until the UK leaves the EU, growing numbers of companies are preparing for a no-deal Brexit against a backdrop of political turmoil and an impasse between London and Brussels. Firms fear that a collapse in the value of the pound could push up costs, that they could face a shortage of EU workers and that delays at British ports could hold up deliveries.Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood UK, said the company had lined up additional warehouse space to stockpile food and drink and had discussed cutting down on meat options to avoid potential shortages.“A lot of meat products like chicken in the UK come from Holland and Poland, so, could you look at more non-meat dishes, vegan or vegetarian options?” he said.The prospect of meat shortages caused by a hard Brexit is reminiscent of Britain during the second world war, when the government encouraged families to bake vegetable Woolton pies as other meals became harder to prepare. About half of all food consumed in the UK last year came from abroad, with almost a third arriving from the EU.Bidfood uses about 1,000 trucks to make more than 12,000 deliveries from 24 depots across the country each week. Two-thirds of its 15,000 food items are domestically sourced, but Selley said a hard Brexit risked shortages of EU products including chips imported from Belgium, pasta and olive oil from Italy and meat from eastern Europe.Unless there is clarity over the political situation before Christmas, Selley said the company would be forced to order extra supplies before Britain exits the EU on 29 March. He said: “We’d need safety stocks in for some of those items, if we felt it was going to be a hard Brexit and we felt those border delays would happen.”According to a survey this week by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, whose members have to navigate import and customs procedures, as many as one in 10 UK firms fear bankruptcy in the event of a no-deal Brexit if it results in even relatively short port delays of up to half an hour. Deliveries of perishables such as food, drink and flowers would be most at risk because they could deteriorate while delayed in transit. A quarter of firms plan to stockpile supplies.HM Revenue and Customs has written to 145,000 firms who only trade with the EU to advise them of the risks of a no-deal Brexit. A spokesman said that its border staff had “well developed plans to ensure that on day one of a no-deal scenario there will be a functioning customs, VAT and excise system”.Businesses up and down the country are however starting to prepare for the very worst outcome, saying they have little choice.The fashion chain Next this week warned border delays could lead to higher prices in its shops and devoted 10 pages of a stock exchange update to explain its contingency plans. BMW plans to shut its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after the UK leaves next March, while Jaguar Land Rover has cut staff working hours. Honda has said a no-deal Brexit could add 60,000 extra pieces of paperwork for imports and exports to the UK while costing the firm tens of millions of pounds.Studies show small firms are less likely to have made preparations as “Brexit fatigue” sets in, although some are gearing-up for a no-deal scenario.Mark Bradley, who runs Digital Image Solutions, a printing business with an annual turnover of £2.5m, said he would stockpile raw materials at the firm’s Wolverhampton warehouse. The firm, which makes giant posters for Manchester City and branding for Virgin Active gyms, needs to protect against a sudden increase in the price of aluminium sheets, vinyl and LED lights from German and Irish suppliers.“We will increase stock, there’s no two ways about that. It just depends on how the negotiations go and the news in the next quarter as to how much we tie up in it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a15ac8701bbce932b63fbaf93575dffdfeda8c6e/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91988971c0d60d326d125342201870bb","title":"theresa may tory grassroots brexit tension boils over","story":"Conservative constituency groups backed the PM after Salzburg, but many are livid about her Chequers planOn a Friday night at a Conservative club in a slightly run down part of Hornchurch in east London, local party members gathered for a pint, a round of darts and to chat about the week gone by. Around a table in the corner, under the watchful eye of portraits of the Queen and Winston Churchill, the local constituency chair, Bob Perry, sat with several of his members.As they sipped their drinks, the conversation turned to Brexit. Earlier in the day, Theresa May had issued a message of defiance from No 10, having been humiliated by the EU rejecting her Chequers plan at the end of the Salzburg summit.The activists were dismayed. “They’ve treated both her and us appallingly,” said Perry. “She’s been tough today but I don’t think she’s gone far enough. But my respect for the prime minister has grown after today. A lot of people say she doesn’t have a backbone, but I think she’s shown them wrong. She has my sympathy.”Sandy Scott, a retired accountant, added: “This is going to be a terrible year for her. She’s trying as hard as she can, but the way she was treated was despicable.”There was a general murmur of agreement from around the table. Even though the Tory party grassroots were furious about May’s Chequers plans, the EU appears to have overplayed its hand.The prime minister’s decision to metaphorically wrap herself up in the union flag with her message of defiance in the wake of Salzburg has achieved its aim, boosting her street cred with the Tory grassroots.“We just want to get through party conference,” said one Whitehall aide. “We had been hoping for warm words at Salzburg to tide her over, but we didn’t get them. So we had to pursue a different strategy.”Downing Street has been starkly aware of the danger posed by bringing together thousands of febrile MPs and party activists at a time when May’s Brexit strategy was still hanging in the balance.“It’s going to be difficult,” acknowledged one senior No 10 adviser. “The PM knows the country, let alone the party, is very polarised and that she needs to get on the front foot to address that.” Uniting the UK after Brexit was expected to be at the heart of her conference speech.Back in Hornchurch, which sits in the Brexit-supporting heartlands where London merges into Essex, it is clear that while the membership’s sympathy could get May through conference, she still faces fierce opposition over her Brexit plans longer term.Perry described her proposals as unworkable. Scott added: “She’s trying her best to get a deal but personally I’d rather have no deal than a bad deal … If this country had a chance and an opportunity it could look after itself. In the second world war we were feeding ourselves.”Elsewhere in the Tory party the atmosphere has been more hostile. In a wood-panelled private dining room at a members club in central London last week, the executive committee of the group Grassroots Conservatives met to discuss the government’s approach to Brexit.Afterwards, the group’s chair Ed Costelloe, a former constituency chair from Frome in Somerset, set out his concerns. “The government and the prime minister have utterly failed to explain how we can do international trade deals while also following EU rules and how will that work,” he said.“If you’re selling something, it doesn’t matter whether it’s a washing machine or a treaty, you’ve actually got to say this is how it works. We haven’t had any of that. I cannot understand what kind of politics it is that says ‘this is a great deal, I’m the PM, I say so’, and there it stops.”Grassroots, a campaign group not officially affiliated to the party, has been deluged by hundreds of emails and letters from activists worried that the prime minister was going to compromise still further with Brussels.“Most people cannot conceive a situation where Theresa May can give any more concessions without totally losing face in the party and the country,” said Costelloe. “Unhappy would be far too mild a word. The membership would be absolutely incandescent.”Delyth Miles, another committee member and former constituency chair from Wales, added: “She has categorically stated that she won’t move her boundaries this time. I want to believe her very much but the outcomes she’s selling to us just don’t make any sense to me and not to thousands of our supporters either.“In all my years as an activist and building up the profile of the Conservatives and the membership, I’ve never experienced such anger and sense of betrayal from people. She’s totally betrayed us.”Hostility towards May runs deep. Costelloe, who has chaired two different constituency associations and speaks regularly to local chairs across the country, believes it has its origins back in 2002 when she offended thousands of members by describing them as “the nasty party”.The options available to the membership, currently thought to be around 125,000 strong, were limited. Their only real power, beyond lobbying local MPs and threatening to withdraw financial and campaigning support, was the final say on who becomes their next leader.Costelloe said: “We’re not making a big stir because of this business of loyalty to the prime minister. We’re not campaigning to change the leadership. The question to ask is would the next general election campaign be led by Theresa May? That’s the key question because I think she has lost the trust of the average Conservative voter.”May’s departure has been widely regarded as a matter of when, rather than if, and activists have openly discussed who might succeed her. Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson’s names come up the most frequently. In Hornchurch, Rees-Mogg will be the star guest at next month’s constituency dinner. Tickets sold out immediately.Others believed the party needed a fresh face, although they conceded May could hang on. Grant MacMaster, a 17-year-old student who has just joined the Hornchurch Tory association, said: “I’m moving towards somebody who isn’t particularly outspoken about Brexit because after Brexit I think there needs to be domestic consensus.”There has been deep frustration at local level at the party’s perceived lack of interest in the grassroots. “They don’t want to know. Talk to any Conservative association. Many will feel that CCHQ and a certain caucus in the upper echelons of the party hold the local associations more or less in total contempt,” said Costelloe.But they have a warning for the government. “They rely on us for financial support and our time but they need to remember we are also expressing the views of Conservative supporters in terms of voters. At the moment there’s real bitterness and frustration out there in the country,” said Miles.While they may feel dejected that the MPs harbour most of the power in the party, rumours of deselection of remainers to assert their authority seem wide of the mark. “There is a mechanism, but why would we want it?” asked Perry. “The possibility exists but it would be extremely rare,” Costelloe said.Tory MPs warned of the threat of entryism over the summer after the former Tory donor and Ukip backer Arron Banks urged thousands of Leave.EU supporters to “flood” the Tory party to elect a “true Brexiteer”, such as Johnson or Rees-Mogg. But the threat did not come to pass.“We have a new computerised membership system which would enable us to recognise a spike, and we haven’t seen one,” said one senior CCHQ official. “Banks is good at publicity but rubbish at logistics. I could be a teenager having a party at my parents’ house with 100 people and say there were loads of people. It’s all relative.”In Hornchurch, over another round of drinks, the group, which also includes Perry’s wife Carol and MacMaster’s mother Karen, agreed that despite the prime minister’s desire to strike a deal, they would prefer to crash out rather than accept Chequers.“We’d all love a deal but the deal has to be on our terms, not the EU’s terms,” said Perry. “I know he’s Ukip but Nigel Farage made a very valid point when he called them gangsters. These people are just bully boys.” The fragile truce in the wake of Salzburg could come to a brutal end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/560e760a24018f5ad2df84eb2ec6a19eb315eeb6/2_3_829_497/master/829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9352731ff96dac3ae87d3e62802abb3d","title":"russia lose to poland at olympiad","story":"The No 2 seeds were visited by Vladimir Putin at their training camp before the tournament, but lost 1.5-2.5 at the Olympiad and now face a battle to win a first title since 2002Thursday’s fourth round of the 184-nation Batumi Olympiad produced a major shock when the No 2 seeds, Russia, desperate to capture their first gold since 2002, lost 1.5-2.5 to Poland. Former world champion Vlad Kramnik was actually checkmated.Earlier, Russia’s top-seeded women lost in round two to Uzbekistan. There are six rounds left after Saturday’s rest day, so both could yet recover, but these were embarrassing setbacks. The Russian squad had prepared for several days at a training camp in Sochi, which Vladimir Putin himself visited to encourage his players.United States and China, seeded first and third, were both held to draws in Friday’s fifth round, after which the unlikely quartet of Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine were the only teams on a maximum 10 match points.Fabiano Caruana, who challenges Magnus Carlsen for the inidual world title in London in November, began with two draws but then defeated India’s ex-world champion Vishy Anand in only 26 moves. After another win in round five, Caruana is now only nine points behind Carlsen in the live ratings, and will surely try in next week’s closing Olympiad rounds for the psychological boost of claiming the No 1 ranking which the 28-year-old Norwegian has held without a break since July 2011.England, seeded ninth, rode their luck in the early rounds. They made heavy weather of the opening match, 3-1 against Angola, then produced a more assured 3.5-0.5 against Belgium before escaping from the verge of defeat for 2.5-1.5 against Brazil thanks to the endgame skills of David Howell and Gawain Jones. Azerbaijan proved too strong in round four, winning 3.5-0.5 as the world No 3, Shak Mamedyarov, outplayed Michael Adams, but England then kept within a match point of the leaders by beating Italy 3-1.The best way to view all the games live and free, including the England open and women’s teams, is at the official website batumi2018.fide.The bitter war of words between Greece’s Georgios Makropoulos, the current deputy Fide president, and Arkady Dvorkovich, Russia’s former deputy prime minister and chief Fifa World Cup organiser, has spilled over to the Fide Ethics Committee before the Fide presidential election on 3 October.Nigel Short, standing as an anti-corruption candidate, has been marginalised by two serious snubs. First, an English Chess Federation board meeting announced that its vote would go to Makropoulos, whose No 2 is the ECF’s international director, Malcolm Pein, already a candidate for Fide president in 2022.Secondly, both Makropoulos, who is probably the narrow favourite, and Dvorkovich, but not Short, have been allocated booths at the Olympiad Expo.3586 1 Nf1! exf1Q 2 Qf8+!

The spectator, who has not been named, was pictured on the ground following the accident on the par-four sixth hole at Le Golf National in Paris. She was attended to by officials before being taken away for further treatment. A Ryder Cup spokesperson said: “She has been taken to the hospital as a precaution but doctors have confirmed the injury is not serious.”Koepka, the reigning US Open and US PGA champion, went on to win his match with Tony Finau, beating Justin Rose and Jon Rahm, but was still upset about the incident afterwards.“I haven’t gotten an update,” Koepka, 28, said. “I actually just asked in the locker room and nobody knew. I obviously saw her. It looked like it hurt. She was bleeding pretty good. It looked like it hit her right in the eye, so hopefully there’s no, you know, loss of vision or anything like that.“But it’s not a fun feeling. I probably do it way more than I should. It seems just about every week we’re hitting somebody, and you know, it’s unfortunate. You’re never trying to.“It doesn’t feel good, it really doesn’t. You feel terrible for them. You know exactly how they are feeling, especially when you’ve got to go over there and apologise, because they are in pain, usually bleeding, and then to hit her in the face - you don’t want to hit anybody in the face, especially not a woman, and it’s not a good feeling.“I just wanted to get out of there, so I’m glad Tony was able to chip-in and leave.”The tee on the sixth hole had been moved forward to allow players to attempt to drive the green, but Koepka’s shot was pulled left into the crowd. “I didn’t actually see her at first,” he added. “I didn’t know I hit anybody and then someone from the crowd yelled: ‘You hit someone.’“And I turned around and then obviously you see someone’s lying on the ground, and you’re thinking: ‘Oh shit – I did it again.’“You can yell fore, but it doesn’t matter. If you’re 150 yards, you’re shouting fore, you can hear it. But from 300 yards, even if none of us said fore, she’s going to get hit, and that’s the unfortunate thing.”A Ryder Cup spokesperson said: “A spectator was hit on the head by a golf ball this morning at the sixth hole. She was immediately supported by marshals and assessed by the medical team on site.“She has been taken to the hospital as a precaution but doctors have confirmed the injury is not serious.

Sarah Taylor is the inaugural winnerOn 19 November last year the two things Sarah Taylor knew were that she did not want to be where she was, and that she could not bring herself to go anywhere else. Two days earlier, England had lost a T20 match to Australia in Sydney. The defeat meant England could not win the Ashes. After it, Taylor’s thoughts drifted. She started to worry about the long flight home later that week. Taylor tries to avoid aeroplanes. It is not a phobia – she likes flight, even enjoys the turbulence – it is that once the plane is up, there is no way off. And she is someone who needs to know she can make a quick getaway. That is why she decided to drive to the next match in Canberra, when everyone else flew.The journey was supposed to take three hours but seemed to go on so long she was utterly exhausted by the time she arrived. There was no time to recover because England had to play again the very next day. The panic started when she got to the ground. “It’s hard to explain,” she says. “Sometimes I tell people it’s like when you’re hungover, you feel really dehydrated, and like someone’s sitting on your head. Sometimes you’re in a crowd and you just feel like everyone’s on top of you, and you start to feel warm, and you just completely lose control. Anxiety is about losing control of your own thoughts.”Always though, her breathing goes. It turns shallow and she starts to feel faint. “It’s completely irrational at the time, and you know it’s irrational, but you can’t change it.” She was not sure she could play that day. Then she saw her teammate, Tammy Beaumont, put on a pair of wicketkeeping gloves and start to warm up and something in her snapped. “As soon as I saw that I was like: ‘Nah, I’m not having that, I need to get my gloves on.’” She told England’s coach, Mark Robinson: “We need to get me through this.” So Taylor played. Between every over, her teammates fed her sweets to help her control her breathing, and put an iced towel around her neck to cool her down.Half an hour into Australia’s innings, England’s quick Katherine Brunt was bowling, and Taylor was standing up to the stumps behind Elyse Villani, Australia’s No 3. Villani stepped from her crease, swung her bat across the line and missed the ball. Taylor caught it, Villani stretched her foot back towards the crease, and in that split-second Taylor broke the bails. Villani was out for one run, stumped. It was a brilliant dismissal any time, let alone by a keeper fighting off a panic attack and feeling as if they might faint any minute. Brunt did not celebrate with Taylor but folded her into a hug and whispered, “Well done”. England won by 40 runs.“Weirdly enough, I think actually playing that day did me more good than sitting in the changing room worrying,” Taylor says now. “Sometimes cricket is the trigger but then sometimes it’s my comfort zone, too.” Sport can be both the cause and the cure. Not that Taylor ever expects to be entirely rid of her illness, just that she hopes to learn to cope with it. “I think I will always have it to be honest, I think it is just an ongoing battle. But I’m not ashamed of it. I’m still a good person, I can still have a laugh. And I still can’t accept compliments or awards.” Which is unlucky, because she gets a lot of both.This is another. Taylor is the first winner of the ’s new women’s cricketer of the year award, because of her batting and keeping, of course, and also the work she has done to raise awareness about mental illness. This year she was a key part of the England team who won two one-day series and a T20 tri-series against New Zealand and South Africa, of the Sussex team who won promotion to the county championship first ision, and the Surrey team who won the Kia Super League. Her keeping has become so good that Adam Gilchrist, who may well keep in the all-time team to play Mars, says that right now she is the “best in the world – male or female”.On Friday it was announced that she will miss the World T20 in the West Indies later this year as she continues to manage her anxiety, a mutual decision taken by Taylor and England’s management team. When Taylor talks about her year so far, the word she uses most is “unscathed”. She is happy she came through it. Taylor is 29, and says a bad year might have pushed her into retirement. It is not difficult to see why she has therefore decided to skip the tournament in the West Indies.There have been low moments along the way. When England broke the world record T20 score, Taylor watched as her teammates blazed 147 from the first 79 balls for the opening wicket. “I was like: ‘I can’t do that’ and all of a sudden you doubt yourself, your anxiety kicks in and then you go into panic mode. The last thing I wanted to do was go out there and bat.” She did not. England sent Nat Sciver in instead. “And then you breathe out in relief.”Taylor has suffered like this for a long time. Only when it first started, she did not know what it was, and the team, even the sport, was not set up to provide her with the necessary support. “I’ve had games where I was sick because I was so nervous. And I thought it was normal. I thought: ‘Everyone goes through this.’ But actually I was having a panic attack.” She started to blame the game. “I thought: ‘Cricket’s done this to me, I don’t have this in my normal life, I hate cricket.’ And I did. I hated cricket for such a long time.” She tried to tell people about it but she did not have the words and they did not have the understanding.“There was almost a stigma, it was a case of ‘brush it off, you’re fine.’ It was a sign of weakness to say anything.” She does not blame anyone, “because at the time if someone had said that to me I would have been like: ‘It’s all right, just go have a good night’s sleep.’ But I like to think that now it would be dealt with a lot better.” It would. She says Robinson has been “unbelievable”. He maps out her season, looking for stress points like long trips between back-to-back matches, and tells her that when she is struggling he will be happy if she can simply get into her kit and out on to the field, let alone score any runs.Taylor does not say it but she has helped push through that change too, by talking so honestly about her illness. In her lowest moment, when she took an indefinite break from the game in 2016, she decided she wanted to give an interview to the BBC to explain what was going on. “I think initially England said I had ‘personal issues’ and I wasn’t happy with that. I didn’t want people second-guessing me. So I said: ‘No, look, this is what’s going on.’ I’m not ashamed of it and I never have been. There’s a ridiculous amount of the population that suffers from it. And I wanted to let people know that it was OK to just talk about it.”Eighteen months later, Taylor’s teammate and friend Kate Cross felt able to speak about her own depression and anxiety too – how it had been so bad that she had spent three days in bed, crying to herself before England’s tour of the West Indies. “We were best mates for years but we never told each other,” Taylor says. “But I guess we didn’t know what it was at the time.” Now the team is a lot more open. “There’s a handful of girls who will say they have suffered with something, or they feel like they might be.” Taylor worries that in the lower levels of the sport, around the counties, players are not getting the support they need and that they will not until the women’s game has turned professional.As we finish talking, a shy young boy in a Middlesex kit comes up to ask for Taylor’s autograph. This happens a lot these days. “I even get the dads coming up to me saying: ‘Can you sign my gloves?’ I think that just shows where the women’s game has gone.” But the fans she really treasures are not always the ones who want to talk cricket.“I had one girl get in touch this summer. She suffers from anxiety as well. I think she’s from Essex, and she got a train all the way to Guildford to come and watch me play for Surrey, and it was, I think, one of the hardest things she’s done. So if people say to me: ‘What did I win this summer?’ Well I got a message from her and a card at the end of the season. That’s what I won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54ca8a803fc4ce5b2b2a3f8c2a3c63b8d5137811/0_132_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d1be36f675b17eb1a1d277b60f3c437","title":"sebastian vettel russia lewis hamilton sight","story":"• German has fallen 40 points behind in title race• Vettel and Ferrari have paid for series of errorsApproaching the Russian Grand Prix as simply another step in his title challenge may feel like the appropriate mental preparation for Sebastian Vettel. Yet if that challenge is not to collapse around him he cannot afford to put a single foot wrong when it matters this weekend.There is more at stake in Sochi than maintaining pressure on Lewis Hamilton. Vettel badly needs to reassert himself to prove he has a credible chance of staying in the fight and ensuring he is in a position to take advantage should Hamilton fail to finish a race before the championship is decided.Hamilton leads Vettel by 40 points on the back of four wins from the last five races and a series of errors that have punctuated Vettel’s season. The Ferrari driver can afford no more. Six races remain, enough for the German to take the title if he wins and Hamilton is second in all of them. It is an already unlikely scenario but for Vettel, who has enjoyed the quicker car since the mid-period of the season, the win he requires is needed as much to show he can still put Hamilton under the cosh as it is to keep the title mathematics ticking over. He insisted the championship is not yet lost but that he must perform to his full potential at the Sochi Autodrom. “You never know what happens but anything is possible,” he said. “I’m not aiming to win all six races. First of all, I’m aiming to win here, then once that’s done we go to the next one and the next one. I don’t think there’s much point looking five, six races ahead. I think you’re much better off staying in the moment at what lies in front of you.”The first critical moment is qualifying. Last year Ferrari locked out the front row with Vettel on pole but he was beaten through turn two by Valtteri Bottas who went on to win. It proved to be the vital pass. Indeed it was the only on-track pass of the meeting and similar overtaking difficulties are expected on Sunday.The track in Sochi is low on tyre degradation and it will almost certainly be a one-stop race. Hamilton has suggested that the pace advantage required to pass will be up to 1.5 seconds – a gap unattainable with drivers on similar tyre strategies. Pole will be key and Ferrari are aware their driver has no breathing room. They have brought a major aero upgrade to Russia, including a revamped front wing. But they too have to execute ruthlessly, failure to do so in qualifying at Monza and Singapore put Vettel on the back foot.Vettel and the Scuderia have been found wanting but the German seems to be wearing the pressure well. He is aware that he can only control his performance but perhaps his greatest difficulty is that Hamilton will be making that task as hard as possible. His team principal Toto Wolff explained how relentless Hamilton’s pursuit of the title remains. “He’s the only driver I’ve ever heard saying: ‘I haven’t driven well, first we have to look at my driving and then we look at the data.’ This constant drive for perfection happens every year,” Wolff noted.Always strong in the second half of the season the British driver has been in imperious form, buoyed by how well Mercedes have been performing of late. “Because of the great rapport in the team, the effort that’s gone in,” he said. “The results we have produced considering we have started weekends on the back foot or slightly behind, yet performed better over all.”Vettel knows then that he must triumph in Russia while Hamilton, who has won at Sochi twice before, is aware he holds all the cards and can play the percentages. “The stakes are as high as they have ever been,” he said. “The money is in the middle of the table, every weekend is a gamble and the risks versus rewards you take means different things.” Vettel was quickest in first practice, with Hamilton in third.In the afternoon session Hamilton and Bottas took a one-two, with Vettel in fifth but with Ferrari expected, as has been the case all season, to really dial-in their car on Saturday morning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0ea4dd662f650f7cb5e0360be7c8384db54def0/0_283_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af7afddf1261a7aa762fb794f6841de","title":"the brexit bogey fans of ryder cup focus on putts not politics","story":"Golf tournament’s united European team offers chance for continental solidarityThe Ryder Cup, one of the world’s biggest sporting events, has teed off outside Paris with golfers vowing to keep politics off the fairways.The tournament, which pits the top US golfers against a united European team, comes as the UK prepares its departure from the EU and Brussels’ relationship with the golf-loving, isolationist US president, Donald Trump, is strained.The transatlantic golf showdownis the third most-watched sporting event in the world after the Olympics and the football World Cup.The European team captain, Denmark’s Thomas Bjørn, said before the tournament opened that his players were an example of how the continent “stands as one”. Six UK players are in the team, including Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy.Bjørn avoided name-checking Brexit, as did other players. England’s Paul Casey, when asked whether the unity of the European fans was heartening at such a tumultuous time for Britain, said: “I haven’t even thought about it. Hopefully I’ve got some matches to play the next couple of days.”With the added interest of Tiger Woods returning to the tournament, most fans were focusing on sport, not global affairs. Many were in stars-and-stripe outfits or wrapped in blue and gold European flags. Of the 51,000 supporters expected each day at the three-day event, at least a third will be British. Some of the British fans on Friday were proudly waving European flags, wearing European caps and saying it was a good excuse to get away from Brexit politics.Donna Capindale, an IT worker from Camberley and a Ryder Cup regular, was wearing matching union jack trousers and a flat cap, teamed with an EU T-shirt. “Britain is still part of Europe, whatever happens,” she said. “I liked Thomas Bjørn’s opening speech saying that we’re united and we’re all in this together. It’s good to bring Europeans together, and it’s a shame if we become ided.”Several US fans said sport was a form of escapism from Washington politics. “It’s all very friendly, there was a tiny bit of booing here and there but nothing more than usual,” said Tim, 35, a wealth fund manager from Minneapolis who was dressed in a stars-and-stripes suit and tie. “Sport is best kept separate from politics.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5002b2b6f2385394f74252cca26b17b57a5028a9/123_30_3783_2270/master/3783.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=123da62acc896732331fef07e5e18ce2","title":"ryder cup 2018 europe v usa day one live golf fourballs foursomes","story":"Europe recorded their first foursomes whitewash in a Ryder Cup to come from 3-0 down and power clear in FranceIt’s been a long day for the American team ... and it’s been a long day for this blog. So that’s your lot. We’ll be up with the lark again for tomorrow’s morning fourballs, followed by some more foursomes fun in the afternoon. If the action’s even half as good as today’s to-and-fro classic, we’ll be in for a treat. Can Europe build on their first-day lead as they attempt to wrest back the cup? Or will the holders regroup and come back at the hosts? It’s going to be a blast finding out. Thanks for reading, and see you tomorrow!For the record, while this is Europe’s first-ever clean sweep in the foursomes, the USA have managed this particular feat on five previous occasions. They swept past Great Britain in 1947 and 1963, Great Britain \u0026amp Ireland in 1975, and Europe in 1981 and 2016.A word from Europe captain Thomas Bjorn. “We believe in ourselves as a group. There were a few guys sitting it out this morning that you would normally see in the first session. But they were very keen to go out and prove we are a team, and we do it with all 12. We are one team. It’s our plan. We wanted to get everyone on the golf course today. And I am proud of the guys this morning too, because they came out and showed quality and class. This was obviously a wonderful afternoon. A disappointing morning, but there’s a long way to go. We go home with a good taste in our mouths and we regroup for tomorrow. Tommy stood up and holed putts on 15 and 16 this morning and gave us belief through the team. This American team is very strong, but we take up tomorrow and fight again. I don’t have to do too many changes, but I will assess everyone.”And then he says: “I believe in Sergio.” Preach on, Captain Bjorn. Amen to that.The afternoon foursomes, then. It’s almost beyond belief. Europe’s first foursomes whitewash in a Ryder Cup their first session whitewash since the Friday fourballs at the Belfry in 1989.MolinariFleetwood beat ThomasSpieth 5\u0026amp4. In goes the birdie putt, and it’s the first time Europe have won all four matches in a foursomes session. This has been a simply sensational display by the home side, especially after the misery of the morning. What a day of golf this has been!Amid all that palaver, Molinari and Fleetwood won the 13th. That means they’re now four up with five to play. This session is a rout. On the par-five 14th, both teams in the final game find the green in regulation. Both have putts from roughly eight feet. Spieth lets his slide by, and briefly considers picking up Molinari’s marker. But the Open champ will have to putt out for the victory.GarciaNoren beat MickelsonDeChambeau 5\u0026amp4. Off the green at the par-five in two, Noren takes out his putter and rolls a gorgeous effort up the bank, nearly holing out from 40 feet. It’s a delightful touch, enough for a share of the hole, enough to close out a sensational victory!McIlroyPoulter beat WatsonSimpson 4\u0026amp2. McIlroy clacks his tee shot at the par-three 16th pin high. Maybe 15 feet away. That ups the pressure on Simpson. He’s got to go close. But he sends his shot over the back and into the rough. Bubba can only pop the ball out without much control, rolling past the flag and away down the green. Bubba takes off his cap and offers McIlroy and Poulter a hand of congratulation!Two putts each for the teams on 15. That means McIlroy and Poulter are 3UP with three to play. The USA can now only win the final game of the afternoon ... but can Europe close out the two dormie matches? They should ... of course they should. But nothing’s ever certain in the Ryder Cup. Remember a young Monty coming back from four down with four to play against Mark Calcavecchia at Kiawah Island in 1991? Well, then!StensonRose beat JohnsonFowler 3\u0026amp2. Dustin leaves his putt well short. Rose, who managed to close out the FedEx Cup last week for a $10m purse, lags up nervelessly to kick-in distance ... and Europe claim the first point of the afternoon! Mickelson and DeChambeau win the 13th as expected, in the wake of Sergio’s rank tee shot. Mind you, Sergio very nearly rescued a par with a rake across the green that stopped a dimple short. Mickelson then had two putts for his par, from 25 feet, and made the birdie. They’re still alive! But for how much longer will Dustin and Rickie survive? Fowler’s tee shot into the par-three 16th is 35 feet short of the flag. Stenson knocks his tee shot to 15 feet. Dustin will most likely have to drain his now.In it goes! That keeps the USA alive, though Europe are now dormie three. In the last match, 12 is halved in par. And with the wind swirling around, McIlroy and Simpson are both extremely happy to find the green, surrounded as it is by water, with their second shots.Johnson is left with a 40-footer, slightly downhill. For a second his birdie putt looks like dropping, but it slides by on the right. Eight feet maybe coming back. That leaves Rose with an outside chance to close out the match from the fringe. He lags up to three feet. His putt is conceded, leaving Fowler that putt to save the match.Jon Rahm lipped out through 360 degrees on 14 in the morning now Ian Poulter does it on the same green. It’s an escape for the USA, Europe unable to get up and down from just off the green, 15 feet from the flag. Careless. Meanwhile Fowler and Stenson take turns to be extremely fortunate at 15. Both of their approaches look like getting wet, but Fowler’s doesn’t quite roll off the back of the island green, while Stenson’s only just gets over by a yard or so. Sergio’s tee shot at 13 does find the drink, though is the great MickelsonDeChambeau comeback on?!DeChambeau fluffs a chip at the side of 12. It leads to bogey. Noren is pretty aggressive with his birdie putt, leaving Sergio with a nervy tiddler coming back. But Sergio strokes it in, and Europe are closing in on victory in that match. They’re dormie six and unless a comeback for the ages is about to take place, it’s surely a matter of time before Europe chalk up a second point. Meanwhile as expected, the par-three 11th goes the way of Thomas and Spieth, the reward for the latter’s magnificent tee shot.Molinari slices his tee shot into nonsense to the right of 11. Spieth fades his to six feet. He sounded angry as he was shouting after it as a general rule, the madder Spieth sounds when he’s hollering at the ball, the better the shot. Chances are the Americans will be grabbing a hole back there. Meanwhile the spoils are shared between the teams in the opening match at 14. Rose looked to have won it, bumping a long pitch from the back of the green to kick-in distance, leaving DJ with a 20-footer to halve the hole. The big man makes the putt without breaking sweat. How can he miss those tiddlers earlier, then do that under extreme pressure? The US would have been down dormie four had that not dropped. But that, dear readers, is the reason why we all lovehate golfourselves. Good old golf!Yep, what a steal! Bubba can’t make birdie from 25 feet, but Poulter can from 20! He pounds his chest, and well he might because that was a crazy birdie by the Europeans! McIlroy turned that hole from a loss to a win with one of the shots of the week, no question. He was halfway down a bank, knees bent, unable to ground his club. Most of us would have fallen face down into the water! But what core strength! He kept strong and whipped a stunner over the water guarding the green, setting up Poulter for his birdie putt. Meanwhile on 10, Thomas can’t get close from a greenside bunker, and another hole goes south for the States.Yes, they’re beginning to jangle all right. Sergio misses a short one at 11, and that’s two bogeys in a row for Europe. Mickelson makes a fuss-free par to further reduce the arrears. Just five holes behind now! Then on 12, Poulter very nearly finds water with his tee shot at 13. Simpson sends America’s second into the heart of the green. Europe are in trouble. But Poulter’s tee shot snagged on the bank. McIlroy then plays an outrageous shot from the hazard, crouching down to whip a ball out of thick grass, over water, and inside Simpson’s on the green! McIlroy’s intervention might turn the tide again!Well, well, well. The opening foursomes match looked done and dusted a few minutes ago. But then on 13 the Europeans were forced to lay up, allowing Fowler to attack. He found the centre of the green, leaving Johnson with a straight 20-footer for birdie. In it goes, and that’s back-to-back holes for the USA! I wonder if a few European nerves are beginning to jangle? There’s been a slight but not insignificant shift in momentum.What’s the Hole-by-Hole equivalent of the half-time entertainment in the MBMs? The Halfway House? Anyway, we’ve no power bars or overpriced cans of Coke to sell. Just this very pretty series of pictures, and you can have them for nix as well.One step forward, then another back, as Thomas and Spieth make a pig’s ear of the 9th. From the centre of the fairway, Thomas sends their third into thick rough to the left of the green. Spieth fluffs the chip out, then Thomas leaves a second chip well short. Europe make their par, but Spieth can’t make the eight-foot saver. Meanwhile another slip backwards for the US team on 12: Poulter sends his approach on 12 into the heart of the green Bubba shoves his into the thick stuff to the left of the dancefloor. The Americans can’t get up and down, and Poulter’s bumping his chest with his fist two putts later. But Mickelson and DeChambeau win the 10th as expected, in the wake of Noren getting wet off the tee.Another win for Garcia and Noren as Mickelson and DeChambeau hack their way down the right of the 9th. This is absurd! Noren’s just sprayed his drive at 10 into the water on the left, mind, but they’ll still be six holes to the good after it all comes down. Another shaft of light though for the USA in the first game, as DJ finally makes a short putt to punish a European bogey and win a hole.You know, it could be! Things change quickly at the Ryder Cup. McIlroy’s tricky downhill birdie putt at 11 slides by on the right Simpson taps in and the Americans reduce Europe’s lead by half in one fell swoop. Magic from Bubba there: just as it looked like Europe were closing in on a three-hole lead, it’s just one! And Fleetwood’s hot putter cools a bit on the par-three 8th he can’t salvage a par from ten feet and Europe’s lead is reduced to two. Some hope for the USA! Ff they can somehow turn around matches two and four, an afternoon that threatens to be disastrous could end up giving them a boost.The pin’s tucked away awkwardly behind water at the par-three 11th. Poulter sends a lovely high fade to ten feet. It’s a glorious shot, and the crowd celebrate accordingly. But then Bubba sends his tee show straight at the flag. As the ball sails through the air, there’s a sole defiant cry of “mashed potato”. It’s well timed, because Bubba lands his ball three feet from the flag. Astonishing! Could this be the moment that the USA launch a sensational comeback?Another hole, another missed tiddler by Dustin Johnson. This one’s shoved to the right from four feet at 11. This is an abysmal putting display by the USA. And to further illustrate that, Rory sends a greenside chip into a bunker at 10, but Poulter splashes out to kick-in distance, limiting the damage to bogey for Europe. Simpson should half the deficit from eight feet, but lets the chance drift by. Europe are playing very well collectively this afternoon, but I’m not sure what the American team had for lunch. They need to get their gamefaces on, and quick.Alex Noren is making his Ryder Cup debut this afternoon. The 36-year-old Swede is 6UP through eight holes. He’ll be wondering what all the fuss was about. This time he sends his tee shot at 8 over the back Garcia chips up to five feet, and he guides in the one coming back.Stenson can’t quite dribble his tricky downhill putt into the cup. But it’s enough for the hole anyway, because DJ pulls a miserable putt left of the cup from short distance. Meanwhile McIlroy comes close with a birdie putt on 9 not quite. And preposterously, it’s another Hole For Europe Anyway, as Bubba waves his putter like a ining rod and yanks a tiddler right. McIlroy looked close to tears earlier today, as he was comforted by his captain in the wake of his heavy fourballs defeat now he’s bouncing off the green like Tigger, all smiles and energy. It’s good to witness his revival. This leaderboard is barely believable.Mickelson and DeChambeau have fallen apart. Another hole goes by the wayside, as Garcia curls in a 15-foot right-to-left putt on 7 Europe have won five of the last six holes! On 10, Johnson can only hack out into the bunker front left of the green Fowler gets to six feet, but Stenson will have a putt from 20 feet to snatch another hole.This is nothing short of sensational from Europe right now! Thomas has a look at birdie on 6 from 25 feet, but doesn’t quite hit it. Fleetwood has a go from similar range ... and it’s never going anywhere but in the hole! When you’re hot, you’re hot. And the USA need to find some inspiration, and quick.Stenson swishes an iron off the 10th tee, and down the centre of the fairway. Fowler takes out Big Bertha and slices into more deep rubbish down the right. This pair are struggling. And they’re not alone. Back on the par-five 9th, both teams are just off the front of the green ... but McIlroy has got Europe there in two, while Simpson’s loose second into thick rough down the left means Bubba can only hack them there in three.For a second, it looks as though there’ll be some much-needed succour for the USA in the opening match. Stenson sends a heavy-handed chip a good ten feet past the flag on the par-five 9th. It leaves Rose with work to do. But he strokes his putt good and true, then clenches his fist in a mixture of relief and defiance.And nothing is going America’s way now. DeChambeau leaves the 6th green powered by the steam from his ears, as he misses a putt to halve the hole from ten feet. All the fault of that errant drive. They’re in deep trouble now. And there’s clear blue water between the teams in the final game too, as Fleetwood guides in a 25-foot par saver, while Thomas misses the USA’s putt from half the distance. This is quite some response from the Europeans, after a disastrous morning!Spieth isn’t enjoying himself at 5. His tee shot whistles into filth down the left Thomas can only plonk him in a greenside bunker. Then he catches the ball first with his sand splash, and he thins it a good 15 feet past the cup. Meanwhile on 8, Simpson shoves a six-footer right of the hole, and though Poulter had left his partner with work to do after leaving yet another putt well short, McIlroy tidies up. Perhaps the dam really has broken after a morning of frustration, and falling two behind early in the afternoon, he’s just won three holes in a row!But it isn’t! DJ misses the short putt, and Europe remain three holes to the good when Stenson tides up. Poulter chips close from the left of 7, forcing Simpson into a miss from 15 feet that match is all square again. And Mickelson and DeChambeau shed another hole, this time at 5. They’re barely functioning right now - and DeChambeau flays another wild one down the left of 6. This couldn’t be going much better for Europe right now ... but there’s plenty of twists and turns to come yet, I’ll be bound.Thomas, having sent Spieth into trouble off the tee, sends America’s third over the flag at 4 and spins it back to five feet. Molinari’s approach topples off the right side of the green. Both end up with pars, a relative success for the US. And the US could be on the comeback trail in the first match, as Fowler’s tee shot at 8 lands six feet from the flag. Stenson’s tee shot falls away down a swale to the left. Rose chips it up to three feet, but par probably won’t be enough.While DJ and Rickie have been hacking their way up 7, Stenson and Rose have been chugging along nicely. A common-or-garden par for them. Fowler can’t salvage par from distance, and the USA are in a spot of trouble in this opening rubber. Europe haven’t even had to do that much: Stenson and Rose are level par for their ball, while Johnson and Fowler are three over.Fowler can’t get out of the filth. He can only hack the ball 30 yards further up the hole. Dustin forces the ball onto the green, but they’ll be looking at salvaging par from 30 feet. Meanwhile McIlroy drives the green at 6. Poulter leaves a miserable eagle putt well short. McIlroy, bereft of confidence, is left with a real tester from ten feet for the win. But he makes it! And how he celebrates, punching the air with a mixture of determination, passion and sheer relief. That’s his first birdie of the day! Finally. Will the dam break now?The US are rocking a wee bit, all of a sudden. While Rose pearls a drive down the middle of 7, Dustin hoicks a dreadful drive into utter dirt to the right. Fowler will have a job extricating their ball from that oomska. Meanwhile on 3, Molinari and Fleetwood make a no-nonsense birdie. So should their opponents, but Spieth pushes a tiddler right, and stares at the sorry scene in disbelief. I wonder if he expected that putt to be conceded. It wasn’t, and for good reason. Suddenly there’s a spring in the collective European step a glide in their stride. A long way to go, of course, if they’re to repair the damage of this morning.Sean Ingle is at Le Golf National. He’s been hanging around the 1st tee, lapping up the atmosphere. Here’s his dispatch!Thanks to John ... and Europe will be happy enough with the way these foursomes are going. Mickelson and DeChambeau are always in trouble down 3 after Lefty’s nonsense tee shot. DeChambeau nearly drains a monster to salvage par, but it lips out and that leaves Europe with two putts to win the hole from 12 feet or so. The US make them putt out. Affronted, Noren makes sure to hole the birdie putt. Europe go 2UP. And they’re 2UP in the first match, too, as Fowler sends Johnson out of position down the left of the 6th hole, and they can’t get up and down.So with things beautifully poised, I’m going to hand back to the man, the myth, the legend – your very own Scott Murray.Molinari whistles his putt past so that’ll be a half. Meanwhile, Fowler misses his putt and Europe go one up in the lead group.Spieth splashes out of the bunker on the 2nd but Molinari will have a great chance of taking the hole with his putt. Rose has Johnson and Fowler under pressure at the fifth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18e06191612690d4145ae82d05f7344de889d38/0_0_4328_3068/master/4328.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0635c9f78cdee6e534685a94434f2688 880w","title":"jeff flake brett kavanaugh latest confirmation senate","story":"Committee vote may ensure nomination will receive a vote on the full Senate floor despite allegations of sexual assaultSenate Republicans are poised to advance Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s embattled pick for the US supreme court, in a committee vote on Friday, ensuring his nomination would receive a vote on the full Senate floor despite allegations of sexual assault.Moments before the Senate judiciary committee convened to formally consider the nomination, Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, the lone Republican swing vote on the panel, announced he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh to America’s highest bench.Flake said Kavanaugh was entitled to the “presumption of innocence … absent corroborating evidence”. A committee confirmation vote was set for 1.30 pm ET.“While some may argue that a different standard should apply regarding the Senate’s advice and consent responsibilities, I believe that the constitution’s provisions of fairness and due process apply here as well,” Flake said. “I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.”Flake’s declaration of support marked the dramatic culmination of the last 24 hours, which saw Ford and Kavanaugh deliver dueling testimony on Capitol Hill about an alleged sexual assault that occurred when the two were teenagers in the early 1980s.The emotionally charged hearing underscored not only the potential ramifications of sending Kavanaugh to the supreme court, where he would play a role in shaping decades’ worth of policy, but also the societal impact of the #MeToo movement and recourse for victims of sexual assault.In the aftermath of the hearing, protesters continued to roam the hallways of Capitol Hill with a sense of urgency rarely witnessed for a supreme court nominee in recent memory.In one particularly contentious exchange, two women cornered Flake in an elevator as he headed to the committee room and implored him to change his mind about his Kavanaugh vote.The confrontation could be seen in TV footage blocking the Arizona senator from closing the elevator door. Through her tears, one woman said she had been a victim of sexual assault, and begged Flake to look her in the eye. She said: “Look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me.”Another woman said Flake was allowing someone who “violated someone” to serve on the supreme court. Flake did not respond. He looked at them, and looked at the ground as he listened. Eventually, a member of Flake’s staff said they needed to go and the doors closed.Kavanaugh is a darling of the conservative right in America but his path to the supreme court has been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations from three different women.Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee assailed their Republican colleagues ahead of the Kavanaugh vote for what they said was an effort to “railroad” his nomination forward. Several of the committee members walked out in protest, while others reiterated calls for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s top Democrat ﻿also sounded the alarm over Kavanaugh’s fiery testimony before the committee on Thursday, stating the judge had been “aggressive and belligerent”.“I have never seen someone who wanted to be elevated to the highest court in our country behave in that manner,” she said.Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, lamented the committee was “no longer and independent of government”.He said: “We are an arm, and a very weak arm, of the Trump White House.”The Senate judiciary committee is narrowly split with an 11-10 Republican majority. Democrats are expected to unanimously oppose the nominee. The full Senate could start taking procedural votes as early as Saturday on Kavanaugh, setting up a possible final vote on Tuesday.It remained unclear if Republicans possessed the necessary votes from the full chamber to confirm Kavanaugh. With a narrow 51-49 seat majority in the Senate, Republicans can afford to lose just one vote.Even as the committee pressed forward on Friday, the critical swing votes of the Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two of the Senate’s most prominent Republican women, remained in question.Red state Democrats facing tough re-election battles in November, some of whom crossed over the aisle last year to confirm Trump’s other supreme court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, also appeared to be undecided. At least two of them, Senators Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, announced they would vote against Kavanaugh on Friday.“As I have made clear before, sexual assault has no place in our society,” Donnelly said in a statement.“When it does occur, we should listen to the survivors and work to ensure it never happens again. That should not be a partisan issue.”The sharp partisan ide was nonetheless readily apparent as the judiciary committee pushed ahead with its vote.Although Republicans praised Ford’s bravery in coming forward, most of them were unmoved, stating her account would not affect their support for Kavanaugh.“I feel sorry for her and I do believe something happened to her and I don’t know when and where,” said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Trump’s. “But I don’t believe it was Brett Kavanaugh.”Trump also made clear that he was sticking by his nominee in the aftermath of Thursday’s explosive hearing. “His testimony was powerful, honest and riveting,” he tweeted. “The Senate must vote!”Meanwhile, there were signs the remarkable testimony had registered negatively with at least two organizations whose Kavanaugh had earlier received.The American Bar Association, which previously gave Kavanaugh its highest rating of “well qualified”, asked the Senate judiciary committee and the full Senate to delay the vote until the FBI could do a full background check. Trump has declined to take such a step.Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, dismissed the idea on Friday, telling reporters Kavanaugh had already “been through six separate background investigations by the FBI”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2950b01ac9981ad599448a437fd15164e543a9a/0_20_6590_3954/master/6590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58b07082fb57206cba77266763479e8f","title":"jeff flake the man who may hold brett kavanaugh future in his hands","story":"Senator falls into line and announces he will back Trump’s supreme court nomineeShortly after Jeff Flake released a statement saying he intended to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, two women confronted the Arizona Republican senator in an elevator, identifying themselves as sexual assault survivors. Flake’s vote had remained in doubt until this morning.One of the women said she had recognized from her own experience being assaulted that Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses the judge of sexual assault when they were both teenagers, was telling the truth.“What you are doing is allowing someone that actually violated a woman to sit on the supreme court,” she said, in the tense and emotional exchange broadcast live on CNN.“I cannot imagine for the next 50 years they will have to have someone in the supreme court who has been accused of violating a young girl. What are you doing, sir?”A second woman told her story as Flake, giving the appearance of conflicted guilt, remained trapped in the elevator.“I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me. I didn’t tell anyone and you’re telling all women that they don’t matter. That they should just stay quiet, because if they tell you what happened to them you’re going to ignore them. That’s what happened to me and that’s what you’re telling all women in America,” she said.Flake’s aides attempted to usher the two women out of the elevator, to no avail.“Look at me when I’m talking to you,” the second woman continued. “You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter and that you’re going to let people who do these things into power … that you’ll let people like that go to the highest court in the land and tell everyone what they can do to their bodies.”“Thank you, thank you,” Flake responded, as they asked if he believed Kavanaugh was telling the truth.“Thank you is not an answer. This is about the future of our country, sir,” the first woman said.Voices from the hallway can be heard joining the fray. “You could be a hero today,” one man said.Flake has been one of the most prominent Republican voices standing up for Ford, telling the Senate before the committee hearing on Wednesday: “I do not believe the claim of sexual assault is invalid because a 15-year-old girl didn’t report the assault to authorities, as the president of the United States said just two days ago. How uninformed and uncaring do we have to be to say things like that, much less believe them?”He released a statement on Friday morning saying he left yesterday’s hearing with “as much doubt as certainty”.“What I do know is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us to the rule of law,” he said. “While some may argue that a different standard should apply regarding the Senate’s advice and consent responsibilities, I believe that the constitution’s provisions of fairness and due process apply here as well.”Flake’s announcement leaves three other senators whose votes are unknown, Maine’s Susan Collins, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia.Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee who, like Flake, has been a rare Republican to occasionally criticize Donald Trump, announced on Thursday evening that he would also support Kavanaugh. Corker said nothing presented on Thursday corroborated the allegations brought against Kavanaugh.“There is no question that Judge Kavanaugh is qualified to serve on the supreme court, and in a different political environment, he would be confirmed overwhelmingly.”Flake has been a consistent thorn in Donald Trump’s side, refusing to endorse him in 2016 and last year announcing his retirement from the Senate because there was no room for him in a party dominated by the current president.“When the next generation asks us: ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up? What are we going to say?’” he asked his Senate colleagues in his speech telling them he would be joining a large number of Republicans standing down in the wake of Trump’s victory, something that analysts think will help the Democrats’ chances at the midterms this November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d795c8c92b5be99806e64e31a97c966bedcf3032/0_409_6176_3708/master/6176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce81b92b98f9c84c50fc83b04027ff3","title":"kavanaugh senate committee vote live","story":"Republican senator says Kavanaugh is entitled to the ‘presumption of innocence … absent corroborating evidence’The dean of Yale law school, which Kavanaugh attended, has also called for an additional investigation before the confirmation process proceeds. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who walked out of the hearing earlier, said he has to “disbelieve” Kavanaugh, who he calls an “angry” man. Senators on both sides have largely avoided saying explicitly that they believe one person and do not believe the other. Blumenthal addresses Dr Ford’s sons, calling their mother a hero. It’s an interesting comment as the Republican senators have repeatedly mentioned Kavanaugh’s daughters and how the process has impacted them. With 30 minutes to go until the vote, here’s a brief roundup of reactions on Twitter to the morning’s news:John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, has called the process an “intergalactic freak show.” He spends his allotted time roundly criticizing the entire procedure. “There were no winners in this room yesterday,” he said. “None. All I saw were two people, two human beings in pain.”Booker has overrun his allotted time and resisted Grassley’s initial calls to wrap it up. “We should not brush aside her comments,” Booker says. “We should listen to her. We should listen to women.” He concludes his statement and walks out of the room. It is unclear if he will return in 40 minutes for the vote. Montana senator Jon Tester, a Democrat, has said he’s voting no on Kavanaugh. So this is where things stand: Democrat Cory Booker, of New Jersey, is now up. He walked out earlier in protest but is back to use his time in the meeting. “This is not a partisan moment for our country,” Booker says. Action is also happening off camera, with senators Flake, a Republican from Arizona, and Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, meeting privately off to the side. Flake surprised many this morning when he said he would vote yes to Kavanaugh. Some pictures of the women who challenged Jeff Flake in the elevator of the Senate building on Capitol Hill. One woman stopped the elevator door from closing and said to Flake: “Look at me when I’m talking to you. You are telling me that my assault doesn’t matter.”You can read the story here:US senator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat from Indiana, said he opposes Kavanaugh’s nomination. He was one of a handful of Democrats who could have swung in favor of Kavanaugh.“I do not view Supreme Court vacancies through a partisan lens, which is why I have used the same thorough process to evaluate nominees regardless of who the president is at the time. That was the case regarding the nomination of Judge Garland and also when I voted for Justice Gorsuch, who was President Trump’s first nominee. It has remained my approach with Judge Kavanaugh.’s Lucia Graves spoke with three women who accused Donald Trump of sexual harassment about the pain they experienced watching the hearing:“This is about character and someone who clearly has no respect for women leading our nation and we’ve just let that continue,” says Rachel Crooks, who alleges Trump kissed her forcibly on the lips in 2005. “We should not be surprised he’s nominated Brett Kavanaugh and stood by Roy Moore and other men who have been in similar situations.For Melinda McGillivray, a Florida resident who was among the first accusers to speak out against Trump, Kavanaugh’s indignation and categorical denials on Thursday carried echoes of the president’s response to her.“I truly feel like Donald Trump had a big influence on his testimony as to deny, deny, deny,” she said of Kavanaugh’s approach. “The mere fact that she wasn’t granted and FBI investigation is completely misogynistic and political.”Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, is speaking about the possibility that Brett Kavanaugh won’t be able to teach law ever again.The Harvard Crimson, the university newspaper where Kavanaugh has taught as a guest lecturer for more than a decade, reported on the hearing yesterday: In a letter to this committee, my former students — male and female alike — wrote that I displayed ‘a character that impressed us all,’” Kavanaugh said Thursday. “I loved teaching law. But thanks to what some of you on this side of the committee have unleashed, I may never be able to teach again.”According to several Law School enrollees, students sitting in Harvard Law classrooms Thursday “applauded” and “burst out in cheers” when Kavanaugh said he might never return to a teaching role.Klobuchar is one of four women on the 21-person senate judiciary committee. “This is not a ‘he said, she said,’” she says. “This is a ‘he said, they said.’”Senator Mike Lee, Republican from Utah, retreading a Republican sticking point. Why wasn’t Ford’s anonymous letter immediately shared with the FBI? Now for Minnesota Democrat, Amy Klobuchar. This is interesting. She does not lead on the Ford allegations. Instead, she talks about Kavanaugh’s writings on executive privilege before moving on to the sexual assault allegation. Klobuchar says she understands that people are frustrated this process happened late in the process, but says the justice system and what matters is: “What do you do when it happens? When you are in a position of power?” Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat from Rhode Island, says he doesn’t believe Kavanaugh’s explanation of his own calendar. He says the FBI has resources to more seriously investigate the contents of the calendar and what they show about Kavanaugh’s actions that night. He also says a serious investigation would not rely solely on comments as evidence. “Over time I expect that facts to come out,” Whitehouse says. “Cover-ups never last. The sand is running through Kavanaugh’s hourglass.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597b7dae5b7558f0857687dbebbc78dd4e120460/0_77_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=406dc8fdd344dcb448c08f3af844991b","title":"fernando karadima pope francis defrocks chile","story":"Vatican said the pope defrocked the Rev Fernando Karadima, who was originally sanctioned to lifetime of ‘penance and prayer’Pope Francis has defrocked the Chilean priest at the center of the global sex abuse scandal rocking his papacy, invoking his “supreme” authority to stiffen a sentence originally handed down by a Vatican court in 2011.In a statement on Friday, the Vatican said Francis had defrocked the Rev Fernando Karadima, 88, who was originally sanctioned to live a lifetime of “penance and prayer” for having sexually abused minors in the upscale Santiago parish he ran.The “penance and prayer” sanction has been the Vatican’s punishment of choice for elderly priests convicted of raping and molesting children. It has long been criticized by victims as too soft and essentially an all-expenses-paid retirement.The Vatican did not say what new evidence, if any, prompted Francis to re-evaluate Karadima’s sanction and impose what clergy consider to be the equivalent of a death sentence. It said Francis made the “exceptional decision” for the good of the church, and cited the church canon that lays out the pope’s “supreme, full, immediate and universal power” to serve the church.The statement said the decree, signed on Thursday, takes effect immediately and that Karadima was informed of it on Friday.The decision appeared aimed at showing a get-tough approach to sex abuse after a series of missteps by Francis and accusations by a former Vatican ambassador that Francis had rehabilitated a now-disgraced former American cardinal early on in his papacy.While the move will be welcomed by Chilean victims as overdue, the decision could spark a religious debate for those who see it as a second punishment for the same crime. Francis’s conservative critics might also bristle at another display of raw papal power from the Argentinian Jesuit.Francis sparked a crisis in his papacy earlier this year when he strongly defended one of Karadima’s proteges, Bishop Juan Barros, against accusations that he had witnessed Karadima’s abuse and ignored it.Francis had claimed that the accusations against Barros were “calumny” and politically motivated, and he defended his 2015 decision to appoint Barros bishop of a small Chilean diocese over the objections of the faithful and many in the Chilean hierarchy.After realizing that something was amiss, Francis ordered a Vatican investigation that uncovered decades of abuse and cover-ups by the Chilean church leadership. Francis apologized to the victims and set about making amends, including getting every active bishop in Chile to offer to resign.To date, he has accepted seven of the more than 30 resignations offered, including that of Barros.Pollsters have cited the Karadima scandal, which first erupted in 2009, as the tipping point in the Chilean church’s progressive loss of credibility among ordinary Chileans.Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of Karadima’s abuse who has been a key driver in pushing for justice for victims and an overhaul of the Chilean hierarchy, thanked Francis for taking action against Karadima.“I never thought I’d see this day,” Cruz tweeted. “I hope many survivors feel a bit of relief today.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b29082534b0e691380c8cc0e238dca3117c9450/0_12_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45214caace58d27630030a97f6236772","title":"melting arctic ice opens new route from europe to east asia","story":"A Danish ship has successfully completed a trial voyage through the Russian ArcticA Danish-flagged cargo ship has successfully passed through the Russian Arctic, in a trial voyage showing that melting sea ice could potentially open a new trade route from Europe to east Asia.The Venta Maersk made the journey as a one-off trial, said Palle Laursen, the chief technical officer of A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s biggest shipping group.The ship, carrying a cargo of frozen fish, arrived in St Petersburg on Friday, after leaving Russia’s Pacific port city of Vlaostok on 22 August.“The trial allowed us to gain exceptional operational experience,” said Laursen, adding the ship had performed well in the unfamiliar environment.The Northern Sea route could be a shorter journey for ships travelling from east Asia to Europe than the Northwest Passage over Canada because it will likely be free of ice sooner due to climate change.Experts say it could reduce the travel distance from east Asia to Europe from the 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) it takes to go via the Suez Canal, to 12,800 kilometres (8,000 miles). This would cut transit time by 10 to 15 days.It’s not the first time a cargo vessel has completed the Russian Arctic route, and Maersk underlined that the journey was “to gain operational experience in a new area and to test vessel systems”.“Currently, we do not see the Northern Sea route as a viable commercial alternative to existing east-west routes,” Laursen said.“Today, the passage is only feasible for around three months a year which may change with time. Furthermore, we also must consider that ice-classed vessels are required to make the passage, which means an additional investment.”During the 37-day journey, Maersk was “in close and regular dialogue” with Russian authorities and ice breaker companies as precautionary measures.The company said the vessel which made the trip is among the world’s largest ice-class ships specifically designed to operate in cold waters.

Thick roots are entwined around fallen lintels. Elsewhere, the stonework is still daubed with orange plaster.“Imagine – there are lots of buildings left to discover in the forest,” he said. “And beyond, in the mountains: who knows?”The sprawling ruins are, scholars agree, the last capital of Vilcabamba: a holdout Inca state that resisted for decades after the conquistadors landed in Peru in 1532, executed the emperor Atahualpa, and occupied the Inca capital of Cusco.Forgotten for centuries, the city of Espíritu Pampa – also known as Old Vilcabamba – has only been cleared in recent decades.And the latest findings, a new site museum and fieldwork both scheduled for 2019 – along with the pending completion of a road through Vilcabamba – are bringing attention to the last stronghold of the Incas once more.Architect and explorer Vincent Lee first mapped out Espíritu Pampa in detail in the 1980s, when the region was under the control of brutal Shining Path guerrillas.“It was a step back into the 19th century just to go there – and a potentially dangerous one,” he said.The jungle “was so thick one could hardly see one building from the next,” Lee added.Today, three government workers use machetes to keep the foliage at bay from a palace compound, the remains of a huge hall with 26 doorways, and a labyrinth of rooms, streets and stairways. “The area is fascinating because it still hasn’t been disturbed or looted. The information is firsthand,” said Javier Fonseca, an archaeologist with Peru’s ministry of culture.“It’s the last capital of Inca resistance,” he added. “It has history, it has archaeology, it has everything. It’s genuinely a marvel to work in this place.”Four successive Incas ruled in Vilcabamba, venerating the sun, engaging in diplomacy and guerrilla warfare with the Spanish – and inspiring rebellions beyond their mountain refuge.Facing an overwhelming invasion in 1572, the Incas set the city ablaze and fled into the forest. The Spanish captured Peru’s last indigenous monarch Túpac Amaru I and executed him in Cusco, bringing the Inca empire to an end. Espíritu Pampa was swallowed up by the jungle.Yet recent research points to a far older origin for the site – and to a web of connections linking Vilcabamba with its European and indigenous neighbours.In one sector of Espiritú Pampa – dominated by towering matapalo trees that grip the ruins – Fonseca pieced together a unique ceramic vessel depicting Andean and Amazonian peoples, backed up by jaguars, united in battling the mounted conquistadors.Perhaps the most intriguing discoveries at Espíritu Pampa concern the Wari – a predecessor culture to the Inca that ruled swaths of Peru between 600 and 1100AD.In 2010, Fonseca identified a sumptuous Wari burial complex near the main site. One occupant – dubbed the Lord of Wari – was found with a silver mask, breastplate, axe blades and ornaments, golden bracelets and dozens of finely crafted vessels.And late in 2017, Fonseca identified a Wari temple nearby, containing both Inca and Wari gold and silverwork.“This society doesn’t disappear overnight. Part of the Wari inheritance survives, thanks to the Incas,” he argued.These cross-cultural finds are currently ided between minor exhibits and storage units, Fonseca lamented, but there are plans to build a museum in Vilcabamba in 2019.The Cobos family would like to see it established in Huancacalle, the small village by Vitcos from where explorers have long set out on foot for Espíritu Pampa.But some fear this buccaneering tradition is coming to a close. Archaeologists are currently mapping the Inca path – to avoid any damage from a highway due to be extended into the valley below.The new road is eagerly awaited by some Vilcabamba residents, mainly Quechua-speaking smallholders who barter potatoes, yuca, coffee and cuy (guinea pigs) to get by.Even if it becomes more accessible, the last city of the Incas will still inspire wonder, and new techniques such as Lidar mapping may soon reveal the true extent of the city beneath the forest canopy.“I’m sure there’s a great deal more to uncover,” said writer and explorer Hugh Thomson.Benjamín Cobos, 90, agreed. As a boy, the Machiguenga peoples that lived at Espíritu Pampa told him of yet another city, even deeper in the forest.“They said you have to walk for five days, along a wide Inca road,” he added. He once followed a barefoot indigenous guide, scrambling up densely wooded slopes for hours.“But, because I didn’t care about ruins then, I turned back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ba8f416ba951bdd1d450b2b153a2ed0cc55b4fc/0_269_3892_2335/master/3892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c69ba4668c1af2cd4500d8a12dd73cc","title":"saudi foreign minister demands canada stop treating it like a banana republic","story":"Adel Al-Juebir escalates row, asking for apology from Trudeau’s government over tweet calling for release of jailed activistsSaudi Arabia’s foreign minister has demanded Canada stop treating it like a “banana republic” and called upon the government of Justin Trudeau to apologize for calling for the release of jailed human rights activists, further escalating a simmering diplomatic row that began over the summer.“You can criticize us about human rights, women’s rights … that’s your right. You can sit down and talk about it, but demand the immediate release? What are we, a banana republic? Would any country accept it?” said the foreign minister, Adel Al-Juebir, at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, as world leaders gathered forthe United Nations general assembly.Al-Juebirreferenced a tweet sent by Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, calling for the release of jailed activists Samar Badawi and her brother, Raif Badawi. Raif Badawi’s wife and children are Canadian citizens.It was a separate tweet of the same content, but translated into Arabic and sent by the Canadian embassy in Riyadh, that in August prompted a wave of anger from the Saudi government, culminating in the expulsion of Canadian diplomats, the near-cessation of trade and the removal of all Saudi medical students from Canadian universities.In his comments on Wednesday, Al-Juebir also attempted to return the criticism, alluding to issues of separatism in French-speaking Quebec and Canada’s treatment of indigenous communities.“It is outrageous, from our perspective, that a country will sit there and lecture us and make demands – we demand the immediate release. Really? We demand the immediate independence of Quebec. We demand the immediate granting of equal rights to Canadian Indians,” he said.“We don’t want to be a political football in Canada’s domestic politics. Find another ball to play with. It’s very easy to fix. Apologize and say you made a mistake.”Earlier in the week, Freeland had expressed optimism that the two countries would be able to mend what has become a fractious relationship.Freeland has previously refused to apologize for the comment and on Tuesday, reiterated her support for the activists.“Canada will always stand up for human rights … we feel a particular obligation to women who are fighting for their rights around the world,” she said on Tuesday, before the Saudi request for an apology. “And we feel a particular obligation to people who have a personal connection to Canada.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc2bbf1627321ddb79f70c2556bdd324d0bfdc99/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=febdb3b7be1d3262c0b542d32ce91f25","title":"un envoy announces plan to restart yemen peace talks","story":"Martin Griffiths says there is huge appetite for a solution, as experts’ mandate extendedEvery day the war in Yemen goes on “is a day that a mother loses their child”, the UN’s envoy to the country has said as he announced a plan to restart peace talks.The scheme would introduce a set of confidence-building measures within a week, including reopening Sana’a airport, prisoner swaps and payment of civil service salaries.It was arranged by the UN special envoy Martin Griffiths after a frenetic round of meetings in New York designed to prevent Yemen from sliding towards a humanitarian disaster as fighting escalates.Griffiths said he was optimistic that overlapping steps could be agreed by Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led coalition that includes the United Arab Emirates and that backs the UN-recognised government of Yemen.He said: “There is a huge appetite for this. Both sides reconfirmed to me their desire to be reconvened, and they both recognise that there is no other solution to this war apart from through this process. We are now working on ways to get them back together as soon as possible.”He said as many as 5,000 prisoners on either side needed to be exchanged. Sana’a airport is blocked by the Saudis.Griffiths said the confidence-building measures had been due to be discussed at talks in Geneva a fortnight ago that did not in the end take place. He said there was no need for the two sides to be in the same building for the measures to be agreed.The talks in Geneva would have been the first between the two sides for two years, but the Houthis refused to travel from Yemen after seeking assurances about the safe passage of some of its wounded soldiers.Griffiths admitted he had no power to demand a ceasefire or prevent the Saudi coalition from pressing ahead with plans to capture the strategic Red Sea port of Hodeida, through which most humanitarian aid into the country flows.“What I won’t do is to make stopping the war a condition for us to resolve it,” he said.In the wake of the collapse of the Geneva talks, the UAE announced plans to restart the military action. In a letter to the UN security council on 15 September, it said: “The Houthis would not have engaged with the special envoy unless there was a fear of losing access to the Red Sea along with the supply of weapons and funds that sustain them. The capture of Hodeida is critical to re-engaging the Houthis in peace talks.”Aid agencies in New York urged the Gulf states not to press ahead with plans to besiege the city or to cut off the aid supply, including to the Houthi-held capital, Sana’a. The UK, which advises Saudi Arabia on military and political strategy, says it has been calling for restraint.In a sign of the complex diplomatic cross-currents over Yemen, EU states including the UK clashed with Saudi Arabia on Friday by backing a one-year extension of the mandate for an independent group of experts set up to investigate breaches of humanitarian law in Yemen.In a report in August that was rejected by the Saudi-backed Yemeni government, the experts said they had found widespread breaches of the law and said the predominant responsibility for deaths lay with the Saudi coalition.At a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council, the mandate to renew the experts’ work was passed by 21 votes to eight, with 18 abstentions. The Gulf states and China opposed the move, while the UK said the humanitarian situation and human rights in Yemen were deteriorating.The UK said: “It is important to give the group of eminent experts more time to fully examine the conflict and to ensure that their conclusions accurately reflect the conduct of all parties in future reporting. It is clear that many incidents and alleged violations committed by all parties have not yet been fully documented, particularly those committed by Houthis.”The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, met the Saudi and UAE foreign ministers on Thursday, in part to discuss the humanitarian crisis and to stress the need for a political solution.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said a fund set aside to rebuild Yemen would be doubled to $20bn due to the scale of the conflict.He said Saudi Arabia had lost “the communications battle at the beginning of the war and that is why our reputation has taken a big hit”."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsToday\u0026rsquos graduates want more from work than just the pay chequeStudents are well-positioned as the growing economy increases employment demand for graduatesHow can graduates make sure they\u0026rsquore appreciated and what do their bosses expect in return?Personal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryHow graduates can make sure they are skilled-up and job-readyEmployees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersWhat is likely to pay off the most \u0026ndash investing in furthering your education or starting your career instead?Graduates are well-positioned for jobs in policy, research, business and administration in the public and private sectorsInternships can be an effective way to gain work experience and increase your employability \u0026ndash but is there a downside?Jobseekers can take steps to maximise their chances of getting hiredHow employers use interviews to gain an understanding of what makes people tickAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interview"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3644913.1538148665!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paschal donohoe confronted by smithfield resident calling for local housing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Local resident Geoffrey Fox speaks to Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe  in Smithfiled, Dublin about his concerns about homelessness in the capital. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has said the Government is committed to building more social housing in central Dublin after being confronted by a Smithfield resident during a press conference.Geoffrey Fox, who has lived in a flat near Smithfield square for 16 years, cornered the Minister on Friday afternoon. Mr Donohoe was in the public meeting area area to announce that former Together for Yes campaign manager Deirdre Duffy would be joining him on the Fine Gael ticket in the next general election.Mr Fox, who was walking by while the press conference took place, called out to the Minister asking why expensive student housing was being provided in the Grangegorman area while people were sleeping on the streets. Assured by the Minister that works were taking place in Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street, Mr Fox interrupted saying: “I know that but listen, you can go home and have your dinner and sit down but these people can’t. They’re sleeping in doorways. It’s not fair.” Mr Donohoe reiterated that the Government was committed to building council accommodation in the city centre but Mr Fox responded with the question: “Is that was a promise?” “It’s happening at the moment,” said Mr Donohoe. “We’re doing a lot of work at the moment to change the derelict buildings into more homes . . . What I’m driven by and what the Government is driven by is trying to make sure that people have good accommodation, that you have a safe home and a roof over your head.”Asked earlier to comment on reports that more than 1,600 people have been removed from the official homeless figures since March, Mr Donohoe said the Government was “not attempting in any way to influence the measurement of figures” and that the focus was on securing housing for those in emergency accommodation. Mr Donohoe said he planned to present a tax code in the upcoming budget which would ensure people are able to take home enough of their salary to maintain their standard of living. “Any tax changes I make will be affordable, they have to be sustainable,” he said, adding that in a post-Brexit Ireland he wanted to have a tax rate where someone can earn an average income without paying a higher rate of income tax.The Minister said he believed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was leading “a very united parliamentary party” despite news that Fine Gael Louth TD Peter Fitzpatrick may contest the next general election as an independent. Mr Donohoe welcomed Ms Duffy’s decision to join the party as a “seminal moment” and described the barrister as “a candidate of really rare calibre” who would make an “exceptional TD for Dublin Central”. Asked to explain her decision to join the party for the next general election, Ms Duffy said there was no point entering an “echo chamber” to bring about change. “You have to have the conversations about the difficult things and you have to find a common ground in order to achieve that change.

Athens has blocked those hopes since Macedonia became independent in 1991, in protest at its use of the same name as a region of northern Greece and its perceived claim to that area and the legacy of its ancient ruler, Alexander the Great.Macedonia’s centre-left government calls this is an unmissable chance to end its dispute with Greece and take a crucial step towards the EU and Nato, and its call for a Yes vote has been backed by a host of top European and US officials who have visited the capital, Skopje, in recent weeks.Opponents say the deal is a capitulation to Athens that undermines Macedonian national identity, and they criticise the referendum question – which asks if voters are in favour of EU and Nato membership by backing the name deal – for combining elements that they say should remain distinct.“On September 30th, all together, consensually, we have a duty to come out and vote for a European Macedonia because our children and future are at stake,” the Balkan Insight news service quoted him as saying.The chief proponent of a boycott is Macedonia’s president, Gjorge Ivanov, an ally of it nationalist opposition party, VMRO-DPMNE. At the UN general assembly in New York on Thursday, Mr Ivanov described the name deal as “historical suicide” and the referendum as “a noose around our necks”.“This referendum could lead us to become a subordinate state, dependent on another country...We will become a state in name only, not in substance,” he said.“On September 30th, I will not go out and vote and I know that you, my fellow citizens, will make a similarly wise decision,” he added.The VMRO-DPMNE party – which only deepened the impasse with Greece during 11 years in power that ended in 2017 – opposes the deal but decided not to call for a boycott of the referendum.The Yes vote is expected to win but turnout may struggle to reach the 50-percent threshold for the referendum to be legally valid, especially given the absence of accurate voter lists that reflect mass emigration from Macedonia.Failure would be a blow to the government but – because the referendum is consultative, not binding – it is likely to move to a final vote on the deal in parliament regardless of the result."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3644482.1538119804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit ni secretary says only may s chequers plan meets uk s objectives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said the  Chequers proposal is ‘a good deal for Northern Ireland”’. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty Theresa May’s Chequers plan is the “only proposal” that delivers on Britain’s objective to leave the European Union, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has said. Speaking in Washington DC at the end of a four-day visit to the United States, Karen Bradley said the UK was committed to working with the EU on its concerns about the Chequers deal. But she stressed that is was the only viable option on the table. Ms Bradley said the UK government wanted to “take control of our laws our border and our money, we’re going to have an independent trade policy, and we’re absolutely committed to no border in the island of Ireland. There’s only one proposal that delivers that and that’s the proposal put forward. There is no other option that delivers on those objectives.”Ms Bradley said Chequers proposal is “a good deal for Northern Ireland” and a proposal that works for the “island of Ireland.”Addressing the fall-out from the Salzburg summit when EU leaders rejected Ms May’s plans, Ms Bradley said that Chequers is “not an easy answer for the UK,” noting that the prime minister had lost 13 members of her own government due to the proposal.”Pressed on how Britain would solve the border challenges in Northern Ireland presented by Brexit, Ms Bradley said: “We cannot see a system where there are two customs territories within a sovereign country,” but she also said that there could be no border on the island of Ireland. “70.5 million people voted to leave the European Union. As the government we have to respect that vote. We don’t want to stay in the European(Union) by the back door,” she said, adding that the Government was following through on what the British public asked them to deliver. She added that British people no longer wanted “bureaucrats in Brussels” dictating trade policy. Ms Bradley was in the United States meeting business, political and civic leaders in the United States. Her visit coincided with prime minister May’s visit to New York for the United Nations general assembly where she told US business leaders that Britain would have the lowest corporate tax rate in the G20 after Britain leaves the European Union, and would be an attractive, pro-business place to invest. Ms Bradley met a series of business leaders in Boston, including tech companies Rapid Seven and Black Duck, companies which have invested in Northern Ireland. “My message is that Northern Ireland is open for business. We may not have an executive, but in Northern Ireland is still functioning, is still striving, still succeeding.”She said Britain’s special relationship with the European Union would continue after Brexit. “The United States is the UK’s closest and more important ally. No two countries in the world do as much and share a much as we do. As the UK does leave the European Union we want to continue building on that incredibly relationship.. so we can stand there as beacons of free trade, beacons of freedom… values that we share.Noting that Northern Ireland is “a very different place” than 20 years ago when the Good Friday Agreement was signed, she said that 50 per cent of the population is aged 40 or under, unemployment is at record lows and tourism is booming. “Northern Ireland is a real success story,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

School cuts threaten the quality of education in this country. We have moral purpose to our young people. They are our future.”The headteachers wrote to parents across the country earlier this week to explain their absence from school.Headteacher of Saffron Walden County High School, Caroline Derbyshire, said: “It\u0027s a very sad reason to have to go and do something like this, I did it with a heavy heart”, but added the experience had also been heartening after seeing the amount of public support.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT),  said that it has been a “fantastic turnout” .The protest was organised by Worth Less?Earlier this year, figures from the Education Policy Institute (EPI) revealed the number of secondary schools in England running at a loss had nearly trebled.The study, published in March, said the number of council-run secondary schools in deficit dropped from 14.3 per cent in 201011 to 8.8 per cent in 201314, but between 201314 and 201617, the number in deficit nearly trebled to 26.1 per cent.In response to funding figures, the Government said it was spending record amounts on schools.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “There is more money going into schools than ever before, rising to a record £43.5 billion by 2020 – 50 per cent more in real terms per pupil than in 2000.“Every school attracts more funding per pupil through the National Funding Formula, high-needs funding has risen to over £6 billion this year, and the 3.5 per cent pay rise we announced for classroom teachers on the main pay range is backed by £508 million Government funding.”Department for EducationManhunt in Denmark shuts down bridges and ferries to CopenhagenComment: This is the lowest point in American politics ... until the next one Iraqi model Tara Fares murdered as she drove through BaghdadPope Francis defrocks Chilean priest at the centre of global sex abuse scandal Officers searching for missing Worcester student Thomas Jones, 18, recover body from River SevernLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowSenate committee expected to back Brett Kavanaugh nomination as key Republican announces yes voteJarvis Cocker pulps Bez in a very special, surreal episode of Bargain Hunt – reviewHeavy rainfall and soaring temperatures behind spike in mosquito-borne feverA Pointless existence?

It means the committee is now expected to approve Mr Kavanaugh’s nomination. That step will not end the confirmation process, with the full US Senate having to hold a vote. However his decision to support the nominee could influence other wavering Republican senators. Mr Flake said: Yesterday, we heard compelling testimony from Dr Ford, as well as a persuasive response from Judge Kavanaugh. I wish that I could express the confidence that some of my colleagues have conveyed about what either did or did not happen in the early 1980s, but I left the hearing yesterday with as much doubt as certainty.What I do know is that our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us to the rule of law. While some may argue that a different standard should apply regarding the Senate\u0027s advice and consent responsibilities, I believe that the constitution\u0027s provisions of fairness and due process apply here as well.Within minutes of the statement being released, Mr Flake, the senator for Arizona who is stepping down at the end of the year, was confronted in a  US Congress lift by sexual assault victims and campaigners demanding he explain his decision. Keeping the lift door open, a woman demanded that Mr Flake look her in the eyes as she heavily criticised his decision and recounted her own experience. One shouted: “Look at me when I’m talking to you! You’re telling me that my assault doesn’t matter.”“Look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me, that you’ll let people like that go into the highest court in the land and tell everyone what they can do with their bodies.”The dramatic scenes played out the day after Mr Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, the California professor Christine Blasey Ford, both gave emotional testimony before the committee as millions of Americans watched on television. Christine Blasey Ford testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on ThursdayProf Ford said that she was “100 per cent” certain that Mr Kavanaugh was the man who allegedly pinned her on a bed at a  1982 house party while they were teenagers, groped her and attempted to take off her clothes. Mr Kavanaugh categorically rejected the claim and hit out at the flurry of late allegations against him, saying the process had become a “national disgrace” and accusing the Democrats of orchestrating a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination”. A vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which vets nominees, will take place on Friday afternoon in Washington, DC. A full vote of the US Senate is expected to take place early next week. In the balance is a lifetime appointment on the top court in the country, bringing with it the chance to shape American society for decades to come. Mr Flake’s support does not guarantee Mr Kavanaugh will be confirmed. Two moderate Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, are yet to announce which way they will vote.If both voted no, he could be defeated, because the Republican majority in the Senate is only two . However Mr Flake’s support makes that far less likely. The three senators, plus one wavering Democrat, had huddled together on Thursday night to discuss the situation. Democrats have urged a delay to allow for an FBI investigation, a move backed late Thursday by the American Bar Association, which had earlier endorsed his nomination.Why are they shutting it down? I believe it’s because they are trying to hide something, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat on the committee, told NBC\u0027s Today program on Friday.Attention to the hearings moved far beyond the world of Washington politics. Prof Ford has emerged in the eyes of many American women as a compelling figure in the #MeToo movement usually associated less with the names of victims and more with a list of high-profile men accused of misconduct.Mr Trump called for senators to act quickly after Thursday\u0027s hearing, a message echoed by top White House aides early on Friday.It\u0027s now time for the Senate to step up and have the vote, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told ABC\u0027s Good Morning America program. Asked if Mr Trump had enough votes to confirm Mr Kavanaugh, she said: I certainly hope so, and I certainly think so.On Thursday, Prof Ford, her voice often filled with emotion, detailed her accusations against Mr Kavanaugh.She told the committee she feared Mr Kavanaugh would rape and accidentally kill her during the alleged assault. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes ... I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help, Prof Ford said.For his part, Mr Kavanaugh testified he was 100 percent certain the incident did not occur.He said: I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.Leonard Cohen\u0026#39s son announces plans for posthumous album of his father\u0026#39s unfinished workManhunt in Denmark shuts down bridges and ferries to CopenhagenComment: This is the lowest point in American politics ... until the next one Iraqi model Tara Fares murdered as she drove through BaghdadPope Francis defrocks Chilean priest at the centre of global sex abuse scandal Officers searching for missing Worcester student Thomas Jones, 18, recover body from River SevernHeadteachers march on Downing Street in \u0026#39unprecedented\u0026#39 protest against cutsLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowJarvis Cocker pulps Bez in a very special, surreal episode of Bargain Hunt – reviewHeavy rainfall and soaring temperatures behind spike in mosquito-borne feverA Pointless existence?

They proved so popular, it was hard to take them down. Women of all shapes and sizes grinned from the walls on their bikes: Muslim women with headscarves tucked under helmets, mothers with children strapped on\u0026nbspchild seats. Most were wearing wet-weather gear. This is Glasgow, after all.“So many people engaged with these portraits,” says Shgufta Anwar, a development officer for Bike for Good, a social enterprise that gets people cycling. “I think they were so popular because we’re trying to normalise women on bikes in the area and it isn’t the norm, at the moment.”Anwar runs many of the programmes out of Bike For Good’s community hub,\u0026nbspwhich opened in May last year\u0026nbspon Victoria Road on Glasgow’s Southside. The organisation was founded by Greg Kinsman-Chauvet after he learned to ride a bike\u0026nbspaged\u0026nbsp30 and found it to be a life-changing experience. He liked cycling so much he moved to Glasgow, sold his car and quit his job to volunteer.The charity arm of Bike for Good started with a small stall in Barras Market in July 2010, teaching people the mechanics of the bike and how to cycle safely. It has since expanded to include a for-profit social enterprise that makes money refurbishing bikes and selling them on. Anything that can’t be used is stripped and sold on as parts, to stop as many bikes and parts as possible from going to landfill.\u0026nbspBike for Good now employs more than 50 people. It is one of several cycling organisations in Glasgow working to meet the Scottish government’s target: for bikes to be used for 10 per cent of journeys made by\u0026nbsp2020, up from the current figure of 2 per cent. (As things are, hitting that target will take 350 years.)But there are positive signs on the front line. The Southside branch of Bike for Good is already outgrowing its premises and looking to relocate to somewhere larger. The main reason it needs more space? More bikes. For most, the key barrier to cycling is not owning a bicycle.\u0026nbspNextbike, a rental city bike scheme, offers over 500 bikes at 63 stations across the city for an annual fee of £60. This is too pricey for many. So Bike for Good joined with other cycling organisations in the city to offer loan bikes for £3 to refugees and other communities on Southside. It tops up the Nextbike supply with its own refurbished loan bikes, which have grown in number from 10 to more than 40.“For some people £60 is nothing, but for some people £60 is everything,” says Anwar. Then there are other barriers. Some people live or work far from the bike stations, others don’t have a smartphone to make the rental or good enough English to understand the process. Bike for Good worked with the other cycle groups to find interpreters to speak to potential cyclists. They welcome newcomers into the Southside hub to hire the bikes, rather than forcing people to sign up\u0026nbspon the phone. The work is ongoing. In its first phase of the project, surveys showed some people without financial barriers were taking the cheaper bikes. Now they are looking at targeting specific groups.\u0026nbsp“We’re also running training because a lot of people lack confidence on the roads,” says Anwar.\u0026nbsp“It’s not just, ‘Here’s a bike, off you go’, it’s support for them as well.”Govanhill is the most erse neighbourhood of Scotland, with more than 50 languages spoken across just 13 housing blocks. It is also the focus of the South City Way, a £6.5m\u0026nbspinvestment by the Scottish government into improved cycle paths to connect different parts of the city and promote cycling as an environmentally friendly, healthy activity. Anwar and the Bike for Good team now have a big job on their hands: to encourage the erse communities of Govanhill to believe that cycling is for them.“One particular culture barrier we had was clothing. People don’t want to wear Lycra, they want to be able to cycle in whatever they wear,” says\u0026nbspAnwar. Most of the Bike for Good fleet are step-through bikes with a low bar. “The ladies love these bikes, particularly for the Muslim and Asian communities because they’re wearing something a bit looser and longer on their figure.”Uber to shift focus to electric bikes and scooters for short tripsHow e-bikes make you feel like you\u0027re incredibly good at cyclingLack of bike lanes \u0027putting off more than half of potential cyclists\u0027Pedal Pathways, Bike for Good’s cycling group aimed at women, has now worked with more than\u0026nbsp200 women from across Glasgow. Sixty per cent of those surveyed said their health and wellbeing had improved thanks to the sessions, which can include yoga, bike maintenance, healthy food and, of course,\u0026nbspa bike ride.\u0026nbsp“The majority of people that come into us with barriers are ladies,” Anwar says. “Some of them are estranged, some of them are not talking to anyone other than their family members, or they’re migrants, they might have been through horrific experiences. The social aspect is really important.”For some of these communities, cycling is something people do if they can’t drive, Anwar says. “People say, ‘Now we have cars, why would you cycle?’” she says. “So you have to get them to think of the health aspect and the environment aspect. It’s about getting people to realise that at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter what you look like, you’re all the same underneath and you’re there for a common purpose, which is to ride a bike.”bike for goodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The loyalty penalty is clearly unfair – 89 per cent of people think it is wrong. The CMA needs to act now to stop people being exploited,”\u0026nbspTalkTalk most complained-about broadband and landline providerBritain must get out of the slow lane when it comes to broadbandA\u0026nbsp super complaint can be made by any government-designated consumer group in order to ask regulators to investigate an issue or practice working against the public interest.\u0026nbspThe CMA confirmed that it would investigate the complaint together with the Financial Conduct Authority and Ofcom and would publish a response within 90 days.FCA ​chief executive Andrew Bailey said Citizens Advice had raised a number of important points.“We expect firms to look after the interests of all customers and treat them fairly, whether they are new or long-standing,” he said.“It is important to get the balance right so that existing customers do not miss out on the benefits of competition and innovation, including when they purchase or renew their general insurance products.\u0026nbsp“The general insurance market study we have announced will help us examine the issues we have already identified in the market in more detail.”Richard Neudegg, head of regulations at uSwitch, said: “Citizens Advice is right to highlight that vulnerable consumers can often end up paying too much on their bills because there isn’t enough support from companies to ensure they get a fair deal.\u0026nbsp“While there are some schemes to financially support these customers in different sectors, these can be difficult to access and don’t have to be available through all providers.“As always, being switched on about the cost of your bills and taking action when companies’ offers aren’t good enough can lead to savings running into the £100s every year. The power should always be in customers’ hands and it is often more straightforward than people think to access better value across many household bills.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sterling subsequently fell sharply after the unexpected result came in, netting large windfalls for those who correctly predicted the result.Remain would be ahead in fresh EU vote, new polls tracker suggestsNicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee, has written to British Polling Council president Sir John Curtice expressing concern that the sale of private polling data threatens to undermine the integrity of financial markets.The warning follows a report by Bloomberg on the sale of private data by YouGov, Survation and ICM prior to the Brexit vote.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage also came under scrutiny after he conceded defeat seconds after the polls closed in the referendum before the result was known, despite apparently being in possession of data which suggested the nation had voted to leave the EU. Mr Farage has previously worked as a commodity trader and currency broker.Funds paid many times in excess of the normal rate for polling in the run-up to the vote having seen the exchange rate movements after the Scottish Independence referendum and realising the profits that could be made.The pound was trading above $1.50 on the eve of the vote, before tumbling to $1.32 when it became clear that Leave was to emerge victorious.“The integrity of UK financial markets is a key concern of the Treasury Committee, and the Bloomberg report raises concerns in this regard,” Ms Morgan said.“During election and referendum campaigns, polling companies present themselves as neutral observers of public opinion. Yet behind the scenes, they are selling private polling data to hedge funds to make profitable trades.“It\u0027s understandable why polling firms are attracted to this more lucrative private work. But there is a perverse commercial incentive to provide misleading information to the public, whilst providing more accurate - and lucrative - analysis to private clients.”The Tory MP is calling on the British Polling Council to modify its rules so pollsters are forced to inform respondents to polls that the information they supply may be used to help private clients to make money.In addition, polling firms would have to disclose, when publishing or discussing published polls, whether they have conducted similar work on behalf of private clients.Under her proposals, they would have to disclose whether published polls have been conducted free of charge, or at a discount to the usual fee such work would attract.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Bosses have since tried to convince investors that their proposed Dutch incorporation will “create a simpler, more agile and more focused company”.Unilever needs at least 75 per cent of votes of London-listed shareholders in order to get the green light for an exodus from the capital.Mr Sadan added: “As a supportive shareholder in Unilever for more than 25 years, we have engaged with the company on a number of issues including its decision to unify its corporate structure. \u0026nbspWe asked the company to ensure that any approach they take safeguards the ability of our clients to maintain their investment and benefit from Unilever’s continued success.”LGIM’s decision to vote against the relocation plans of the UK’s third largest company mirrors the opposition expressed by other shareholders, including Brewin Dolphin, Lindsell Train and Columbia Threadneedle.Nicla Di Palma, equity analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said: “We aren’t convinced that the move will realise tangible benefits for shareholders and plan to vote against.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The loyalty penalty is clearly unfair – 89 per cent of people think it is wrong. The CMA needs to act now to stop people being exploited,”\u0026nbspTalkTalk most complained-about broadband and landline providerBritain must get out of the slow lane when it comes to broadbandA\u0026nbsp super complaint can be made by any government-designated consumer group in order to ask regulators to investigate an issue or practice working against the public interest.\u0026nbspThe CMA confirmed that it would investigate the complaint together with the Financial Conduct Authority and Ofcom and would publish a response within 90 days.FCA ​chief executive Andrew Bailey said Citizens Advice had raised a number of important points.“We expect firms to look after the interests of all customers and treat them fairly, whether they are new or long-standing,” he said.“It is important to get the balance right so that existing customers do not miss out on the benefits of competition and innovation, including when they purchase or renew their general insurance products.\u0026nbsp“The general insurance market study we have announced will help us examine the issues we have already identified in the market in more detail.”Richard Neudegg, head of regulations at uSwitch, said: “Citizens Advice is right to highlight that vulnerable consumers can often end up paying too much on their bills because there isn’t enough support from companies to ensure they get a fair deal.\u0026nbsp“While there are some schemes to financially support these customers in different sectors, these can be difficult to access and don’t have to be available through all providers.“As always, being switched on about the cost of your bills and taking action when companies’ offers aren’t good enough can lead to savings running into the £100s every year. The power should always be in customers’ hands and it is often more straightforward than people think to access better value across many household bills.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But NOA\u0027s pitch is that it\u0027s not a competition at all, and that audio can be about showing off some of the best traditional journalism in an entirely new setting.While audio is perhaps the oldest of all forms of media, the ways it is being delivered to people isn\u0027t at all. The advent of Amazon\u0027s Alexa, for instance, heralded an entirely new form of listening within the home, favouring on-demand cuts of information that can be requested by shouting while doing the washing up traditional radio still exists but it is increasingly being delivered over the internet when people ask, rather than as traditional broadcast.And the growth of ways to listen has come with an expansion of the listening public, too. With on-demand audio, people have come to see (or hear) that there are various times of the day that go largely unfilled, and it\u0027s apps like NOA – as well as other major audio companies like Audible – that are rushing into stop them being so silent.Amazon Alexa will now listen for strangers in your houseNOA works in a relatively simple way: its team take the best of their partners\u0027 written content, have a narrator record it, and push it out into the world. Its audience can then listen however and whenever they want, simply by opening up the app on their phone or asking Alexa to do it for them.The great thing about it is the time you have each day to consume visual content is limited, says Gareth Hickey, co-founder and CEO at NOA. You might take a quick look at a screen in the morning, and an hour or two in the evening. And that time can be filled up not just with news or other media like on demand television and Netflix, but also social media, emails and WhatsApp.Audio, however, doesn\u0027t have to compete: it can be done while driving, walking, exercising or doing something else entirely, and so can be a complement rather than distraction.About half of NOA\u0027s consumption comes between 7am and 9am. That gap in the day there just gets a lot of traffic – it\u0027s people that are usually commuting.There are of course many companies vying for that time too, many of them new. Everything from the shortest podcast to the longest of Audible\u0027s audiobook is intended to take on that market.But there is an awful lot of that time, too, and it is often spent doing a variety of different things. That means that companies like NOA seeing themselves as complementing podcasts rather than challenging them.That\u0027s useful become some companies like the New York Times have invested heavily in podcasts.They try much own that experience, and they\u0027re doing a great job with that. They\u0027re putting a huge amount of thought and time into getting that right.Instead, NOA focuses on the traditional articles that continue to do so well for those publishers. It is not about the kind of lengthier chats that often make up the meat of podcasts, but rather taking the quality content that news organisations are already producing it and recording it so people can listen to it another way.The style of content that we tend to lean more and more towards is the opinion, analysis, features, he says. The kind of articles that you might come across on a busy Monday afternoon and might not have the time to read.When people do come to those articles, they tend to spend a decent amount of time: about 85 per cent of people coming to an article will finish it, and they\u0027ll stay for an average of four-and-a-half minutes.NOA, of course, has some of the same struggles as every other news publisher. One of them is ensuring that people feel they can make their way through the vast amount of information that\u0027s out there in a way that\u0027s comprehensive and meaningful – without feeling completely overwhelming.One of the things we\u0027re moving towards has been an attempt to bring finish-ability to news topics, he says. It\u0027s all very well reading one piece about Brexit or business or whatever else, but with those huge issues it cane difficult to know where to start or where to end.One approach that NOA has been taking is to gather those topics up into playlists. One about electric cars, for instance, might include a more general overview on the industry, a e into the cobalt shortage that is threatening the batteries that power them, and a look at the latest scandal Tesla and Elon Musk have become embroiled in.It all helps to make people feel like it\u0027s possible to reach the end of the news, even if it\u0027s just to find that some more news has happened. When there is such an often overwhelming amount of stories – and stories about those stories – NOA like other more traditional publishers in seeking ways to cut through the noise.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sterling subsequently fell sharply after the unexpected result came in, netting large windfalls for those who correctly predicted the result.Remain would be ahead in fresh EU vote, new polls tracker suggestsNicky Morgan, chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee, has written to British Polling Council president Sir John Curtice expressing concern that the sale of private polling data threatens to undermine the integrity of financial markets.The warning follows a report by Bloomberg on the sale of private data by YouGov, Survation and ICM prior to the Brexit vote.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage also came under scrutiny after he conceded defeat seconds after the polls closed in the referendum before the result was known, despite apparently being in possession of data which suggested the nation had voted to leave the EU. Mr Farage has previously worked as a commodity trader and currency broker.Funds paid many times in excess of the normal rate for polling in the run-up to the vote having seen the exchange rate movements after the Scottish Independence referendum and realising the profits that could be made.The pound was trading above $1.50 on the eve of the vote, before tumbling to $1.32 when it became clear that Leave was to emerge victorious.“The integrity of UK financial markets is a key concern of the Treasury Committee, and the Bloomberg report raises concerns in this regard,” Ms Morgan said.“During election and referendum campaigns, polling companies present themselves as neutral observers of public opinion. Yet behind the scenes, they are selling private polling data to hedge funds to make profitable trades.“It\u0027s understandable why polling firms are attracted to this more lucrative private work. But there is a perverse commercial incentive to provide misleading information to the public, whilst providing more accurate - and lucrative - analysis to private clients.”The Tory MP is calling on the British Polling Council to modify its rules so pollsters are forced to inform respondents to polls that the information they supply may be used to help private clients to make money.In addition, polling firms would have to disclose, when publishing or discussing published polls, whether they have conducted similar work on behalf of private clients.Under her proposals, they would have to disclose whether published polls have been conducted free of charge, or at a discount to the usual fee such work would attract.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They were sent back over a distance of around 180 million miles.They come after the space agency successfully landed two rovers on the asteroid, dropping them from a spacecraft floating just above the surface.The rovers dropped down onto the asteroid by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft are the first mobile exploration robots ever to land on an asteroid\u0027s surface. The images they are sending back are the first time that anything has ever autonomously moved and taken pictures themselves on asteroid, too.One of the pictures includes the shadow of the antenna and pin of the rover itself.​ The pin – which is the long line that can be seen sticking out of the rover – helps increase friction when they engage in the hops that they use to jump around the surface, among other purposes.Jaxa, the Japanese space agency, says that both of the rovers are in good condition and are transmitting images and data. The pictures they are sending back have confirmed that they are moving themselves around the asteroid\u0027s surface.The rovers will spend their time exploring the planet\u0027s surface by being joined by yet another visitor,\u0026nbspcalled Mascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.The new pictures are the second batch to be sent down by the\u0026nbspHayabusa-2 spacecraft. The first were taken as the two rovers tumbled to the surface, and show their whirling motion as they fall.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Those microorganisms could have been able to survive for hundreds of millions of years on the ancient planet.“We showed, based on basic physics and chemistry calculations, that the ancient Martian subsurface likely had enough dissolved hydrogen to power a global subsurface biosphere,” said Jesse Tarnas, a graduate student at Brown University and lead author of the study published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters. “Conditions in this habitable zone would have been similar to places on Earth where underground life exists.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

They cannot get energy from sunlight, so instead peel electrons off molecules in the environments that surround them.Nasa reveals what it plans to do with water on the MoonAround four billion years ago, Mars would have had the same conditions that sustain huge numbers of microbes down on Earth today.The researchers are clear that the findings don\u0027t definitively mean that alien life existed on Mars. But they are important evidence that if life did get started there it would have been able to sustain itself.By combining\u0026nbspa range of different data about the red planet, scientists found that it probably had a habitable zone that stretched for kilometres deep and all around the world. It would have existed for hundreds of millions of years.Scientists now hope the findings can be used to inform future trips to Mars that will attempt to find evidence of alien life.“The mission of the 2020 rover is to look for the signs of past life,” Mustard said. “Areas where you may have remnants of this underground habitable zone — which may have been the largest habitable zone on the planet — seem like a good place to target.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Absolutely.”The EU sees Brexit talks as Britain’s ‘managed capitulation’The comments are the strongest evidence yet that moderate Tories are flexing their muscles to prevent Theresa May carrying out her threat to allow the UK to crash out of the EU if necessary.Some senior cabinet ministers are also believed to be alarmed that the UK could end up facing a no-deal Brexit “by accident” and want the prime minister to adopt looser, Canada-style\u0026nbsptrade proposals as a fallback.Speaking on ITV’s Peston programme, Ms Rudd warned hardline anti-Brexit Tory MPs that continuing to obstruct Ms May’s efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels could backfire on them.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think no deal will happen,” she said, arguing a Norway-style EEA deal\u0026nbsp– effectively keeping the UK in the EU single market – remained a possibility.And she said: “It would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexity people in my party were unable to support the prime minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“So I think they have to think very carefully about the consequences of not supporting a negotiated settlement.”The Independent has launched its Final Say campaign, to give the British people the crucial decision on any Brexit deal. More than 835,000 people\u0026nbsphave signed our petition.The former home secretary, who resigned over the\u0026nbspWindrush scandal, put herself among “about 40” Tories opposed to a Canada-type deal, more than enough to defeat it, in alliance with opposition parties.May and Trump talk ‘big, ambitious’ post-Brexit trade at UNBrexit ‘poses severe threat’ to fight against drug harm and crime Jeremy Corbyn to meet with EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel BarnierCorbyn offers Brexit truce with May if her final deal is ‘sensible’She said: “There are so many reasons a Canada-type deal doesn’t work, starting with the Irish border, going on to manufacturing, that I think we can make those arguments.”The prime minister has continued to ramp up the threat of a no-deal Brexit as the only alternative to her Chequers proposals – which have been rejected outright by EU leaders.Last month, Nick Boles, a former Tory minister, warned party hardliners that their “dream” of a no-deal Brexit would be blocked by at least 40 fellow Conservatives.And The Independent revealed in June that they could use a “humble address” – the tactic Labour used to force the government to release Brexit economic assessments – to prevent it.Meanwhile, Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade secretary, told the same programme that Jeremy Corbyn’s conference speech did amount to Labour “bending” its red lines on Brexit.In the address, the Labour leader said he would back a deal brought back by the prime minister if it kept the UK in a customs union and protected jobs, workers’ rights and environmental standards.Mr Corbyn did not mention the “six tests” previously set out by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, which demanded the “exact same benefits” as the test for backing an agreement.Mr Gardiner said: “All of us don’t want the no deal that will take us off the edge of that cliff.“And if it means compromising, if it means you bending your red line to give us a customs union, we’re prepared to bend our red lines to give, to give this a deal.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I did have it in the back of my mind\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsBrodkin hands Theresa May a fake P45, on stage in Manchester last year On Wednesday 4 October 2017, two people woke in their hotel beds in Manchester with a certain trepidation about the day ahead.One had been struggling with a bad cold, a cough and a sore throat for almost a week. She had a long and important speech to give, a speech on which the morning papers claimed her job depended, and that job was prime minister.The other had a less lofty undertaking laid out before him, but it was a matter of life and death.Tories take aim at May ahead of party conference: ‘Stuck in the past’“I was flicking through the papers,” says Simon Brodkin, the doctor-turned-comedian-turned-professional prankster who, armed with a Conservative Party conference lanyard and a mocked-up P45 was about to make a small bit of British political history. “I was seeing a lot of pictures of snipers on rooftops. A lot of men with guns. Tensions were running high in the country at that time, and terrorists do make a prankster’s job that much harder.”Brodkin has got plenty of previous of this kind of stuff, on the England football team, on Kanye West, Manchester City, Sepp Blatter and Donald Trump, but this was something altogether more ambitious.“But this was different. There was so much tension around. I didn’t know if she’d have rules, you know, like, if you get within a certain perimeter of the prime minister, that’s it, it’s a code red, you go down. I did have it in the back of my mind.”P45 to Theresa May during conference speechBoth characters would end that day’s drama very much alive, albeit with\u0026nbspone having suffered the worst day of their professional life,\u0026nbspwhile the other enjoyed what was probably the best. Both performances\u0026nbsphad been a long time in the planning.\u0026nbsp“With the stunts that I do, you’re always looking for a target. You want to punch up, and there’s no more up than the most powerful person in the country, although that day, and in the many months since, she has seemed like anything but,” he says.“She had called that election on ‘strength and stability’, and it had all been utterly undermined. It just felt that there was this groundswell of public opinion, that it might be time for her to move on. That was what I felt the temperature was like at the time.“I just thought, ‘Oh my God, imagine handing the prime minister of this country a P45.’ That just made me smile. It represented the mood of the country. And then I thought, ‘Oh, hang on, if we can make that P45 from Boris Johnson it felt like tying all those things up together.”\u0026nbspIn the minutes, hours and now almost a full year since, people have complained about the “security risk” Brodkin posed to the prime minister. That “anything could have happened”, but that is far-fetched. “How did this idiot manage to get to within a few feet of the prime minister?” people have breathlessly asked. But the answer is straightforward.“Once you have an idea for a stunt it’s worth working out whether it can be done, where it can be done, how it can be done. And the conference started to feel like there could be the potential there. She’ll be making a speech, she’s up by herself. I thought, ‘Well how am I going to get access to the conference?’“And there is a very simple answer to that question. I applied online, under my own name. It was just a normal, boring application.”To watch the speech back now, it is clear Theresa May is struggling with her voice\u0026nbspright from the start. In fact, she had been struggling badly with a cough during her interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show three days beforehand.It has since been suggested it was Brodkin’s intervention, and the heightened nerves it engendered, that rendered the prime minister unable to speak. It’s also been said that the rousing applause that greeted his ejection unsettled the magnets on the backdrop, causing them to fall off moments before the end.She had just begun a passage attacking Jeremy Corbyn when Brodkin rose from his seat.\u0026nbspHe is certainly right that tensions were high. I was in the room myself, in the far corner, 50 yards or so to the prime minister’s right, in seats reserved for the travelling Westminster press pack. Most of us us had witnessed something highly traumatic out of our office windows just six month before.When a bizarre and eerily silent commotion started occurring at the front of the stage, and something was clearly going awry though nobody knew what, there was a palpable sense of fear and dread.No one was really paying attention to the giant screens above the prime minister’s head, where in the bottom corner, a shaky piece of paper appeared, with the letters P45 writ large in the bottom corner.Brodkin can be heard saying, “Boris told me to give it to you.”As Theresa May finally takes the piece of paper, desperate to to get rid of him, she loses it.\u0026nbsp“It’s the Conservative Party that has a vision of an open, global, self-confident Britain,” she says. Then adds: “While our opponents flirt with a foreign poricy of neutrality and prepare for a run on the ground.”“I was amazed that she took it,” Brodkin says. “She smiled as she did so. So thank you, Theresa, for that. I did it in a very non-threatening way. I never want to scare people, or cause alarm.“I’d dressed as a little Tory boy. Blue tie, blue cufflinks, side parting. So when I handed it to her, I looked like an aide trying to hand her something for her speech or something.“After she’d taken it, her security team were so unalarmed they just lowered me back down, as if they were going to sit me back in my seat.“So I went up to Boris and did my best Tory boy voice:\u0026nbsp‘That’s it Boris, I’ve given her it from you. Went well don’t you think?’ I gave him a slap on the thigh.“That was the point at which they appeared to work out, that guy should definitely not be there. The snappers were following me. Alarm bells were ringing with security. That’s when they realised, ‘Get this person out.’“That’s when the atmosphere did change, a visceral change, a wave of negativity towards me. The chants of ‘Scum! Scum!’ and then being dragged out did confirm that they didn’t want me there.”Created with Sketch.Tory conference 2017 – in pictures  Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

European Union flag during a protest on the opening day of the Conservative Party Conference, in ManchesterAs Brodkin was dragged out by security, a second wave of personnel rushed in. Huge sections of the press seats vacated in an instant and stampeded towards him, still not very much wiser about what exactly was going on. In the adjacent press room, scores of journalists jumped up and rushed towards the auditorium, seeking to cut him off at the exit.“I was sitting on the end seat and I could see he was going to be led out past me,” says the ’s chief political correspondent, Christopher Hope. It was he who, in the footage that went slightly viral later, was so penned in to the melee that his dictaphone appeared to be pressed like a Taser against Brodkin’s neck.\u0026nbsp“In more than 10 years in politics, my experience of these things is that when you have an intruder, or someone who eggs someone, or a protester, or someone who gets involved in a way that they shouldn’t, is that you’ve got about a minute before they’re led away.“I put my arm around him and just started yelling questions at him. Who are you? Are you an activist? What did you give to the prime minister? We didn’t know he was a prankster. You only have a minute to ask everything you can.”“Usually, after a stunt, there’s sort of an eerie\u0026nbspcalm. The security services remove you and it’s kind of quiet.“That is not what happened here. I was followed by this baying swarm of political journalists, trying to work out what was going on.“They were thinking, ‘Who is this guy? He is shouting all sorts of things.’ I don’t think any of them were thinking ‘comedy’.”“They were asking me these amazingly serious political questions. ‘Why have you done this? What have you done?’ And I said, ‘I’ve given Theresa May a P45!’ And they shouted, ‘Why?’ And I said, ‘Because Boris told me to!’“And this was the best bit. One journalist said, ‘When did he ask you? When did the meeting take place?’ That was one of my all time favourite moments. They were all having to walk backwards. They were hitting bins, they were hitting lampposts and shouting, ‘When did he tell you! When did he ask you to give it to her?’ I was just leaving a trail of fallen cameramen and journalists.”It was at that point, however, that things got a bit more tense, albeit briefly.“I was taken out of the melee and into the security zone and there was utter silence, and shit got serious. Six very large armed officers formed a ring around me. They don’t know what’s happened, they just know I’ve been dragged out by security having done something wrong. I’m stood there with these burly guys. In real life, I am a tiny Jew.Johnson unveils ‘better Brexit’ plan as he tells May to scrap ChequersEverything you need to know about the Conservative Party ConferenceMay told to end austerity by senior Conservative on eve of conferenceIf May offered a final say on Brexit, she would win another election“And they’re surrounding me with these guns and they’re all being very serious, right until one of the coppers looked to me and said, ‘Big fan of your stuff mate. But I think you might have pushed too far this time.’ That’s when I was thinking I’m in serious doodoo.“Then this detective came along, this smart looking woman. You know when they’re not wearing uniform they’re pretty high up the chain of command. She immediately thinks she’s got me bang to rights.“She flashed her badge to me and said, ‘Right. How the hell did you get in?’“I said, ‘I applied.’ She said, ‘What do you mean, you applied?’\u0026nbsp“Then you could see her thoughts, you know, what is she going to be able to do me for, just slowly ebbing away.“She said, ‘Okay, let’s just arrest him shall we\u0026nbspwhack him in the back of the van.’”Back in the conference hall, unbeknownst to Brodkin or to the phalanx\u0026nbspof media that had rushed after him, things had turned from bad to very much worse. Barely halfway through the speech, with whole pages still to go, Ms May had lost her voice entirely, and it was anything but clear how on earth she would make it to the end. By the point at which she did, the set was falling apart around her.“It was a very difficult day,” one of Ms\u0026nbspMay’s aides said. “I remember the huge outpouring of support for her in the hall. And there was that rather nice picture of Amber Rudd\u0026nbspgetting to her feet and willing her on. But if was a rather tough day.”\u0026nbspAs things were getting worse for the PM, things were getting better for Brodkin.“It was all over fairly quickly. At the end of the process they just said, ‘Sir, you are free to go.’“One of them said, ‘By the way, that was very funny.’ I got a couple of photos with them.“I guess it was Manchester, it was Theresa May, it was the police, who suffered huge cuts under her.”\u0026nbspBrodkin didn’t see the rest of the speech, and still hasn’t watched it. “They don’t give you live TV in the cells,” he says, which is not unreasonable. “But I heard reports she was struggling. I did feel sympathy for her.”Ms May has another speech to give this Wednesday, and Brodkin, who has worked for years as a standup,\u0026nbspsays he would be happy to meet up.“All of being a politician is about performance. If she wants to meet up we can try and work on delivery.”But he does offer one, more radical suggestion: “She still hasn’t used that P45, has she?”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . .

The most important issue facing the country right now and Labour had next to nothing to say about it.But we know they’re planning to support a second referendum on the issue. Selling down the river the millions of Labour voters who thought we were best out of the European Union.At first, Labour — with great principle — stuck to the decision of the referendum.Not now they see a chance of power, the prospect of hoovering up all those votes from Remainers who think we got it wrong two years ago.

that little Amy is clever because she knows all the answers.What he doesn’t realise is that Amy does her homework with her family every night.American comedian Rob Delaney ignited a lively debate when he tweeted: “Why do they give seven-year-olds so much homework in the UK and how do I stop this?I want my kid frolicking and drawing and playing football.”Fellow celebrities Gary Lineker and Jason Manford agreed.Piers Morgan disagreed, calling the arguments “lazy parenting”.I have to disagree too with Mr Delaney and his supporters.Homework is essential for a child’s education because revisiting the day’s learning is what helps to make it stick.So Catastrophe star Rob and Gary Lineker are wrong in attacking compulsory home-work in primary schools.Sure, you’ll get the odd exceptionally bright pupil who will excel just through what she learns at school, despite not having that support at home.But this is very rare.Teaching is not just the teacher’s job.It takes a village to raise a child.Children learn all the time and the environment surrounding them determines how much they learn.Genes play a part in how clever a child is, but how hard they work also matters.Work hard and you’ll learn lots.Work less and you’ll learn less.Don’t make the mistake of thinking homework is for a child to do on their own.When parents use homework to bond and learn together with their child, the child understands that Mum and Dad value learning.And because a child wants to please their parents, the child’s interest in their home-work will grow, year on year.These children can see the benefit of homework and will enjoy doing it because it makes them feel better about themselves.Everyone loves to feel successful.Ten years ago, author Malcolm Gladwell introduced the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in something.We get better at what we practise, whether it’s football or maths.Our brains have a working memory and a long-term memory.If your times tables are stored in your long-term memory, you will quickly be able to calculate what it will cost to buy 12 apples instead of two.If that knowledge isn’t there, you’ll have to resort to counting on your fingers.The more knowledge stored in long-term memory, the better equipped you’ll be to think imaginatively and solve complex problems.Homework revisits what you learn at school to cement it into your long-term memory.I do agree that some home-work is pointless.Silly craft projects that involve gluing things together, which the parent will inevitably end up doing, hold no value for me.I also understand why some parents don’t like homework — they feel that it’s a battle.Parenting is hard.I get that.But we need to stop thinking of homework as a chore that the child is sent off to do, cutting into the parent’s precious time with them.It shouldn’t be the case on Sunday night that Mum says: “Oh God, it’s homework time — let’s get it over with.”Instead, learning should be part of daily le, and an enriching time for both the parent and the child.Reading with your child for 20 minutes should not be a chore.Asking them to count peas on their plate should not be hard work.While you’re out in the street, talk to them about the world around them.This is the sort of homework that is often set for very young children and it can be done without making it feel like a formal lesson.It doesn’t need to be half an hour sitting at a desk.It can just be ten minutes of enjoyable time together.Homework can be written down but can also be spoken or done online, leaving little marking for the teacher.Secondary-school homework can help you learn with your child.You can learn some French again or be reminded of the beauty of Shakespeare!How wonderful is that?By scaffolding the support at home, you can gradually wean them off it, just like taking off bike stabilisers.Eventually, they learn to work independently, so that when they get to GCSEs, they will be in the habit of doing their homework each night.If you don’t get them into the homework habit from an early age, you risk having a battle with a stroppy teen as they approach their exams.And no parent wants that.Those who are against homework will argue that their children have no time for other hobbies.This is nonsense.Children generally finish school at 3.15pm, and younger ones tend to go to bed at about 8pm.That’s nearly five hours of free time.Are they really spending it playing hockey or going to Brownies?I doubt it.Half an hour of homework in five hours of spare time is a drop in the ocean, leaving lots of time for other things.The real worry for parents should be how much time children are spending on social media — something that is so very dangerous and takes up hours of their time, unlike homework.Katharine Birbalsingh is head of Michaela Community School, North London, and has been dubbed the country’s “strictest head teacher”.She introduced an ultra-disciplined approach to

Thick as he is, ­Corbyn sees no contradiction.Then it was on to Jezza curing all our ills with freebies galore and mass job creation, all presumably funded by the same tax on the rich. Since Labour aides now privately admit their 2017 manesto secretly covered up a £1TRILLION bill, Corbyn’s assurances aren’t worth the autocue they are written on.This smug, cocky Labour conference is an annual reminder of just what a dishonest rabble they now are. Sickeningly posing as defenders of the dispossessed while plotting to annul their Brexit votes with a second referendum, brought about by orchestrating chaos.One moronic MP even demanded a General Strike to oust the Government. Frontbencher Richard Burgon stood and applauded.

It is, in reality, a dog-eared hard-left roadmap to ruin on a scale we have never experienced.A Britain which would kill ambition and enterprise and drive out successful firms by stealing their property. Where investors would fear to tread and from which anyone who could would flee.Labour’s candidate for PM is a dim, vain, vindictive, unapologetically anti­-Semitic ball of rage who loathes scrutiny, lies habitually about his true beliefs and past terrorist connections and is, his aides admit, “not good in the mornings”.But the Tories must not mistake all that for a free pass. Corbyn’s plans have traction only because the Government has left the battlefield.Theresa May and Philip Hammond are timid tinkerers when we need radical steps to put more money in pockets and make homes affordable.

But there are options on the table to get out of this mess.“As the numbers show, instead of pumping more cash into failed ideas like Help to Buy, we should be building much more social housing to give hard-pressed families an alternative to the private rented sector.“Not only would this be a massive stride towards ending this crisis, but it’d be wildly popular too – so let’s get on with it.”Between 2001 and 2018 the size of the private rental sector doubled, from 11% of the adult population to 28%.The same period also saw a marked decline in the number who own their own home, falling from 73% of the population to 59%.The Tories are consumed by Brexit.

But in 1920, Elsies mum, Polly Wright, took the pictures to a mythical research group called the Theosophical Society to be investigated.Leading society member Edward Gardner was instantly taken with the photos. He blew them up into prints and started selling them at his talks.Then, in 1920, keen spiritualist and Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle came across the photos while he was researching a magazine article about the creatures.He believed they were real and when he published them, he created a national controversy which left some of the most esteemed scientists and thinkers of the time earnestly arguing whether fairies really do exist.Fairy buff Edward Gardner was also convinced. He went to visit the Wright family and set the girls up with a camera so they could capture more evidence.In the summer of 1920, they took three more images of themselves with the fairies, fuelling more interest in the bizarre debate.Doyle also contacted photo company Kodak, asking expert technicians to examine the prints for signs that they had been tampered with.The response was that the photos showed no signs of being faked, although Kodak refused to provide a certicate of authenticity. Doyle maintained that they were real.Newspapers soon picked up on his claims, with some writers agreeing that the photos seemed legitimate, while others poured scorn on the supernatural shots.Some sceptics noted that the fairies looked too traditional to be real, as  they had been plucked out of a nursery rhyme, while other criticisms included the claim that the fairies hairstyles were suspiciously fashionable.Knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that they have pulled one of them, one critic wrote.With nobody able to agree, the story eventually died down, only to be reignited decades later with a spectacular twist.In 1966, a reporter tracked down Elsie, who admitted that the fairies might have been figments of my imagination.Frances was also tracked down and quizzed about the photos. A rational person doesnt see fairies, she admitted, but she claimed the photos were genuine nonetheless.However, the cousins eventually confessed that the pictures were a hoax, and that they had made the fairies themselves, before throwing their props into a river to hide the truth.Elise and Frances, by that time old women, conceded in 1983 that they had drawn the mythical beings onto cardboard, cut them out and then arranged them in the garden with hatpins to make them stand up.Bizarrely though, Frances then claimed that one of the five photos - showing a cluster of fairies wading around long grass - was never faked, even though the others were.She also claimed at one point that she really had seen the fairies in real-le, but then staged the photos so she had evidence.Later, in 1985, Elsie revealed why she had gone along with the prank for so long, saying she had been embarrassed about fooling Conan Doyle and didnt want to show him up.Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle – well, we could only keep quiet, she said.Frances added: I never even thought of it as being a fraud – it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I cant understand to this day why they were taken in.A year later, Frances died, and Elsie followed in 1988. However, their hoax remains commonly thought of as one of the greatest ruses of the 20th century, and the legacy of their photos lives on today.Expected to sell for at least £2,000, the first two Cottingley Fairy photos are being auctioned off in Gloucester on October 4, when a new owner can get their hands on a piece of history - and a little bit of real-le magic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That means that your eggs cant meet sperm and therefore fertilisation cant happen. Your eggs will simply be absorbed into your body after being released from the oies.Most women go home the same day but as with any surgery, theres a small risk of complications.These include:And of course, theres a small risk that the operation wont work - blocked tubes can rejoin immediately or years after the surgery.But one things for sure - a successful surgery is very dficult to reverse, so you have to be sure that its right for you.Source:  NHSOne solution put forward was to have the mum moved to another hospital which is better equipped with more facilities and resources, and where she could be seen by a specialist who might be able to correct the errors made in the first operation.A spokesperson for the hospital told reporters that all clinical procedures were followed during Ms Caceres initial operation and that after her second surgery to insert the colostomy bag she was monitored correctly.Despite this, they do also claim that something is going to be done about Caceres current condition.As yet, its unclear whether she intends to sue the hospital for medical negligence."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000437635957.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"driver parking ticket driveway croydon","story":"Celia Hossenbux, 66, from South Croydon, claims the vehicle was only blocking part of the pavement outside her home for a couple of minutes but was still given a fine.She says she was forced to stop partially on the pavement as her home was having the guttering done and her husband had parked further back than normal.Mrs Hossenbux says she ran into the house to get him to move his car but in that time she had been given a ticket.She told the Croydon Advertiser: I came in as far as I could, I blocked a small area of the pavement but before I came in I checked behind to make sure I was not blocking too much of it.My son is disabled and uses a wheelchair so I am always aware that there needs to be room.By the time I came out there was a ticket, it was done it such a swt time which makes it more unbelievable - I was back out there in a couple of minutes.She added the reason she did not reverse out of the driveway when she knew she couldn’t park properly was because motorists regularly broke the 20mph speed limit and it was “suicidal” to reverse into road.Mrs Hossenbux received the ticket in May and has had two appeals rejected by the council since then.She has refused to pay the £195 fine and said she could be taken to court.She said: I think they really just want to make money out of people like me.There is no other reason why they would reject that [appeal].

As soon as a phone is submerged in water, especially sea water, it dies.“Even  it were to survive, it would not get signal from the bottom of the ocean. All this shows the plane did not crash into the sea.”A 449-page final report released in July by the Malaysian government only deepened the mystery - revealing that the plane’s sudden change in direction was a deliberate manoeuvre by somebody in the cockpit.However what caused the Boeing 777 to ert 37 minutes remains a puzzle with most of the pieces missing.Some feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH370.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.French ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.Malaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH370 could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Malaysia Airlines found a 15-inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH370 disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing 777s so it did not receive the warning.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.In the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had 220 passengers on board, on March 5, 2014.Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and erted into the communist nation.In September 2018, British video producer Ian Wilson claimed to have found the missing aircraft using Google Maps.Despite millions being spent on the search to located the wreckage, the Brit sleuth believes he has found the jet in a mountainous area of the Cambodian jungle.In response, the Chinese government used observation company Space View to focus in on the high-altitude area on the outskirts of Phnom Penh.However, the firm claim there was no sign of any plane, least of all the Malaysian Airlines aircraft which has been missing since March 2014."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436817828.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sizzling summer and cheap mouse traps have sparked a plague of maggots in the uk","story":"A plague of MAGGOTS is sweeping the nation after the warm weather caused a surge of infestations in homes up and down the country.The scorching temperatures have provided flies with the perfect nesting conditions, meaning their offspring - maggots - have been hatching and thriving in record numbers.But thats not the only problem.Now temperatures are dropping, rats and mice are are retreating inside, and homeowners are killing them with shop bought poisons.The rodents are then dying in the walls and vents of houses - and flies are feeding on them and nesting in their corpses. Now, more and more Brits are finding nests of maggots in their homes.The soft white wriggly worm-like larvae can hatch in as little as 24 hours in the heat - and live for five days before turning into flies.Peter Higgs, who runs PGH Pest Control and Prevention, tells Sun Online he has received an unprecedented number of call outs to deal with maggots over the past week.“We’ve had at least a hundred calls over the summer. That’s more than double what we’d normally receive, he says.It’s not just maggots in bins, they’re dropping from the ceiling in homes and shops.”And Peter says we are ALL responsible for the maggot population explosion.“Britain’s hot summer has meant there was a healthy fly count. We’ve all been outside in the garden or parks for picnics, he tells Sun Online.“When food gets left in the heat it rots quicker as bacteria forms much faster in warm temperatures. It’s a feasting ground for flies.“It means that maggots are hatching in gardens, bins and also on dead animals around suburban homes and gardens.”According to Peter, home and business owners are only now discovering they are living with maggots thanks to the recent drop in temperatures.“Rats and mice aren’t stupid. If a building isn’t rodent proof they know how to get in out the cold.The problem is, when well-meaning homeowners put down DIY poisoning theyll die in the walls – but flies lay their eggs on those rotting corpses.“This week we’ve been called out to an opticians with maggots falling from the ceiling in the client waiting area. That was as the result of a dead animal in the vents.“A restaurant also had to temporarily shut up shop because maggots were dropping down into their customers food. It is distressing for everyone involved.”Maggots can be killed with boiling water – but pest control experts advise to always look for the reason behind why the maggots hatched in the first place.Peter’s advice is simple: “As disgusting as they are there is always an even more sinister reason you’ve got them. Identy that and you’re sorted.“It could be a dead pigeon in the roof or a poisoned rotting mouse under the floorboards. Flies love bacteria-spewing corpses and will lay dozens of eggs on them.“If they are in your bins – you need to make sure clean them out regularly, with a disinfectant. They need a good seal and ensure that rubbish is properly bagged up.“Finally make sure your building is pest proof.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

via the A34.The normal journey would take less than ten minutes but the new route across two counties will take two hours.Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service described it as the biggest traffic ersion ever in the country. Duncan Buchanan, policy director for the Road Haulage Association [RHA], slammed the plans.He said: I am stunned by the suggested alternative route for HGVs, it is truly an enormous distance.“It is a monster ersion, taking lorries a zillion miles out of their way.We think of Highways England as having one job to do and that is to run the road network correctly for key users.Its a debacle and they are not focused on this and key road users.”The RHA said a single trip along the ersion route would cost a haulier an extra £35 in fuel alone.Malcolm Gibson, managing director of Hampshire-based international freight company Steve Porter Transport, said: It will certainly affect some of our customers who are travelling to us.“The section between junctions three and

He proved that Becks’ notice of prosecution had arrived a day later than it should have. Mr Loophole – real name Nick Freeman – is the lawyer of choice for celebrities who want to get off a driving charge .Sir Alex Ferguson avoided being punished for driving on the hard shoulder of the motorway after Freeman argued in court that the former Manchester United manager was having a “squeaky bum time”, desperately driving to use the Old Trafford toilet while suffering an upset stomach.No stranger to controversy, the lawyer caused a furore this year after suggesting that women who didnt want to be upskirted should “should dress more conservatively”.“The more provocative the attire,” he argued, “the greater risk of someone wanting to have a sneaky view.”Freeman clearly loves his job. He’s written before that loop-hole hunting has left him “almost shaking with excitement ”.If youre a Peeping Tom, or any other kind of law-breaker, in need of help, Freeman could probably mount an effective defence –  you can afford his astronomical fees.But helpfully, Freeman wrote a book, called, of course, The Art of The Loophole.It details his sneaky legal knowledge that has got the likes of Ronnie OSullivan, Sir Alex Ferguson, Freddy Flintoff and Charlotte Crosby off the hook.So  you cant afford thousands, here are some tips from his book that will help you beat the rap.As a rookie prosecutor, he lost a drunk-driving case because hed hadnt submitted a printout of the breathalyser record, only getting a police officer to say the reading in court. If you want to escape law, you should check  the prosecution has followed the law and submitted its evidence correctly. Any little cock-up by them could be your ticket to freedom.Having saved Fergie his licence by arguing for the poor state of the Scotsmans bowels , he thinks medical reasons can be a strong defence.If you couldnt blow into a breathalyser because you had a cold, “then it could be recorded on the station’s CCTV. And there may be ious officers who might remember whether or not you were sneezing or coughing.” But “you can’t simply make it up,” he counsels. “Otherwise you waste my time and your money”.“You might think that in our over-scrutinised, flash-happy age of the speed camera, proving the identity of the driver in a motoring case is fairly easy,” Freeman says. “Not so.” Having got footballer Ashley Ward off a speeding rap by arguing the prosecution couldnt prove the identity of the driver. “If a policeman doesn’t ask for some kind of concrete ID, such as a driving licence with a photo, he leaves himself wide open to being unable to confirm identity,” advises Mr Loophole, having seen the Crown lose many cases because lazy coppers didnt ask for official identication.He recalls another case: “Court papers referred to my client as exposing his penis. He claimed that it was his testes. Could the Crown be sure beyond reasonable doubt that they could ID his anatomy?”Don’t blab your story, even to your solicitor. “It’s not my job to prove he wasn’t disqualied,” he writes of a case, “it’s the Crown’s to prove he was”. So dont admit to any possible wrongdoings to a lawyer – and possibly compromising them – and just let them see  the Crown can make a case against, and there may be “a whole assortment of defects in the paperwork alone that might stop them from doing that.”When Lee Bowyer was convicted for speeding, allegedly peaking at 132mph in his Porsche, Freeman noticed slight dferences in the officers four reports. This weakened the case enough to help him to get the Crown to accept a plea of speeding at 99mph, giving Bowyer a ban of only six weeks and no penalty points. Similarly, Dwight Yorke was pulled over for allegedly driving at 102mph, but the officer made seven subsequent changes to his first report – making for a shaky case that resulted in only a fourteen-day ban.Freeman advises that we always check the small print: “wherever you get paperwork, human error isn’t lagging far behind.” The most common errors being “names are misspelt, or wrong addresses or dates are recorded, notices or,” as happened with Beckham this week, “summonses arrive after the allotted time for their dispatch has expired.” Each and any error is a possible escape route from conviction. “The trick then is to be able to spot such errors. There’s no real skill here – just a laser-like focus.”Freeman once got a client off the hook after hed refused to take a breathalyser test following crash that devastated a family. The police failed to charge him for his refusal, wanting to get him to take a blood test – the results of which were inadmissible because the rules hadnt been obeyed. “If the police had followed the correct protocol my client would have been convicted,” admits Freeman. “It was because of this error – this loophole – that he walked free.”A brilliantly successful lawyer, Freeman focuses on making sure the Crown has done its job properly.If it hasnt then whether you did or didnt commit a crime doesnt matter. No case is too big to fail  they havent made it properly, and can be beaten just by looking for the largely minor mistakes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a bit cramped, a bit tight, but it’s fine.”Today Anandamohanadas told The Sun he had no idea his property had been raided.He said: “This is the first I’ve heard of this. I was there at 10am yesterday.”In stark contrast to the property he rents to tenants making £1,000 a week, his immaculate home lies in a quiet cul-de-sac in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.A white Toyota Rav 4 in the driveway and the house has large extension with a private garden.Outside the rented property occupied by Romanian builders a tenant said: “I sublet from another tenant. I’ve been in the UK since 2010 so I’m kind of a British citizen.”Furious neighbours Karson Mepani, 64 and his we Manbai, 62, have complained to the council about the slum housing and claim food and cigarette butts are thrown into their garden.They also claim their Romanian neighbours play loud music from 10pm at night and are regularly heard fighting and shouting between each other in the house.Karson Mepani said: “It has been let out for the past two or three years.“But the landlord does not know about what the letting agent is doing.“They play loud Romanian music from 10pm until the early hours especially on Saturdays, the noise is dreadful.“We also regularly hear them fighting inside, shouting and screaming at each other.“We are p****d off, I would not mind 50 people living next door  they weren’t so noisy.“Several times we have had food and cigarette ends thrown into our garden.“They are also hanging clothes out to dry on the fence between our houses.“They are disruptive neighbours and we are delighted that someone is finally doing something about it.”A spokeswoman for Brent Council said it was one of the worst illegal HMOs it has uncovered.She said: Aside from seeing rodents or cockroaches it is one of the worst we have seen.The loft was just appalling - really awful conditions."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004371736252.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"how boris gove sajid and more are using tory conference to launch their leadership campaigns because theyre convinced may is toast","story":"Bookies predict the gathering which starts on Sunday will be Theresa Mays last as PM - Ladbrokes is offering odds of 4/6 that a new leader will be in place within a year.So several of the top candidates to replace her are now competing to boost their popularity with activists and their fame among the public.Well-known Tories are planning to speak at multiple fringe meetings, setting out their vision for Britain and their election pitch.Here we profile the top candidates who are clamouring for position over the four-day conference.Boris Johnson is the bookies favourite to take over from Theresa May - with odds of 10/1 that hell be the leader a year from now.At the party conference hes keeping his powder relatively dry, doing just one fringe event.But that meeting - in a hall with a capacity of 1,000 - is set to be one of the standout moments of the conference.Boris will be keen to prove hes still a superstar among the Tory faithful who have the last say on who will succeed Mrs May.Michael Gove, who as Environment Secretary is hailed as one of the most dynamic Cabinet ministers, is listed to speak at least five times.He is attempting to burnish his green credentials by appearing at events hosted by farming and environment groups.Mr Gove hopes that developing a pro-environment image will help him with swing voters around the country.Sajid Javid is seen as the frontrunner for the leadership among ministers who voted Remain in the EU referendum.As well as making a speech from the conferences main stage, hes expected to appear at a number of carefully picked fringe events.He will address one meeting debating the importance of law and order - his current brief as Home Secretary.And crucially, Mr Javid is helping to host a reception for MPs elected since 2015 - who could hold the key to the next leadership election because theyre seen as being less committed to a particular candidate already.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is fast developing a reputation as the Cabinets resident Tigger because of her upbeat demeanour and raft of policy ideas.Shes now regarded as a dark horse for the leadership, with her quirky Instagram account gaining her fans from among young activists.Ms Truss is speaking at several fringe events - mostly aimed at promoting free-market ideas and appealing to the youth.Priti Patel was forced to quit the Cabinet last year after meeting Israeli politicians in secret.But she still harbours leadership ambitions and hopes to overtake Boris and Mr Gove among Brexiteers.So she is appearing at a number of high-profile fringes, including a pro-Brexit rally and a think-tank debate on the future of Conservatism.Amber Rudd is another ex-minister who still hasnt given up on the aim of making it to 10 Downing Street one day.As a former Home Secretary, she is an expert on immigration and security policy - two of the most important areas for the Tory grassroots.Ms Rudd is speaking on security in the internet age at one fringe, and attending two talks on migration.Jacob Rees-Mogg was the main attraction at last years conference, with every event he spoke at packed out with adoring activists.This year hes dialled it back a bit - but hes still scheduled to speak at seven dferent fringes.Observers will be keen to see whether he still has the same star power as he did a year ago."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-seti-green-bank-telescope_4417507.jpg?20180911090802 ","title":"david beckham shirked responsibility over speeding charge say road safety groups","story":"He added: \"It is hugely disappointing to see a role model like David Beckham shirking his responsibility and getting off a speeding prosecution on a mere technicality.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga_4434384.jpg?20180926190320 ","title":"kremlin photos dont prove novichok suspect is russian intelligence officer","story":"\"We don\u0027t know to what extent we can make any formal conclusions about who looks like whom, are they alike, where they lived, where they grew up,\" he said.\"On the Red Square there are still 10 Stalins and 15 Lenins running around, and they look remarkably like the originals,\" he said, referring to people who dress up as Soviet leaders to pose for photographs with tourists."},{"url":null,"title":"never miss update things you","story":"NewsNever miss an update on the things you care about -

And nothing could sum that up more than this extraordinary photo of Brett Kavanaugh on \u0027trial\u0027 in a court of public opinion - the US Senate. To the left and right of the Donald Trump\u0027s Supreme Court nominee sit five women, all with looks of disgust and horror rippling across their faces. But it is not what it first appears. Far from being accusers, disgusted with the 53-year-old\u0027s alleged actions, they are his family and his allies. Their disgust could therefore be assumed to be about the fact the allegations have surfaced in the first place.  To his right sit his mother Martha Kavanaugh, family friend Laura Cox Kaplan and his we Ashley Kavanaugh. To his left are longtime friend Suzanne Matan and former clerk Zina Bash.  The photo captures an extraordinary saga that has transfixed the US and ided supporters and critics of Donald Trump even further than before.  University professor Christine Blasey Ford fought tears yesterday as she said Kavanaugh assaulted her at a High School party, declaring: I believed he was going to rape me. Saying she was 15 and he 17, she told the Senate Judiciary Committee: Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was very inebriated and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothing.  She said she tried to yell for help but Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. He and a friend of his were drunkenly laughing during the attack, she added. Dr Ford said she could not remember the location or exact date of the incident 36 years ago, but said she was 100% sure it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her. She told the senators she was terried to testy but felt it was her civic duty to come forward. And two other women, Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, have accused conservative Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the 1980s. But in an angry, extraordinary statement yesterday, Kavanaugh blasted Democratic senators and accused opponents of a calculated and orchestrated political hit.  Calling himself a victim of grotesque and obvious character assassination, Kavanaugh said he unequivocally and categorically denied Ford\u0027s allegation. I swear today, under oath, before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God, I am innocent of this charge, he said. He added: I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process.  Dr Ford told the hearing she feared he would rape and accidentally kill her.  I am an independent person and I am no one\u0027s pawn, she said.

With banners saying ‘fund state education properly’ and ‘Head teachers say there is nothing left to cut’ they brought traffic to a temporary standstill in Parliament Square. Unlike many protests in the square the leaders were dressed for business - in suits and ties. Mr Rob Kelsall of the campaign group Worth Less?, which organised the march, said: “We are seeing schools that are seeing their funds depleted, dipping into their reserves, and having to send out begging letters to parents. This is not through choice, this is because there is no alternative.” Scroll down for what teachers themselves say about the crisis.  In July, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said total school spending per pupil fell around 8% in real terms in England between 2009/10 and 2017/18. In response, the Government said it was spending record amounts on schools. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of 29,000-strong school leaders’ union NAHT, said schools were at “breaking point” and almost three-quarters of heads say they will be unable to balance their budgets for next year. The protest is being organised by grassroot groups and not unions, but Mr Whiteman said: Head teachers are not normally the marching kind. So, when they do, it must be serious. “They’re sick of being told that there’s more money in education than ever before, when what they see with their own eyes every day proves that it’s just not enough. “More and more now, children succeed despite the system, not because of it. And that can’t be right.”  Organisers estimate more than 1,500 had turned out, and burst into applause as they lined up on Whitehall when they were told the letter had been delivered in Downing Street. Police estimate 2,000 people took part. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: There is more money going into schools than ever before, rising to a record \u0026pound43.5 billion by 2020 – 50% more in real terms per pupil than in 2000. The OECD has recently confirmed that the UK is the third highest spender on education in the world, spending more per pupil than countries including Germany, Australia and Japan. “Every school attracts more funding per pupil through the National Funding Formula, high needs funding has risen to over \u0026pound6 billion this year and the 3.5% pay rise we announced for classroom teachers on the main pay range is backed by \u0026pound508 million government funding. What head teachers told us about the schools crisis  Elaine Ball, 52, from Orleans Park School in Twickenham said:  “Teachers are being asked to do so much more with so much less. “We now have to put money into frontline care, my school has to fund a mental health worker and an educational psychologist to come in once a week - that’s on top of everything else “Things are so bad we’ve had to ask parents for money to fund a new food and nutrition classroom, a second-hand minibus and an updated IT suite.” Susan Pietrzak, 44, from Manor Field Infant School in Basingstoke said: “The only way we’re going to balance the books is by losing really great teachers and teaching assistants. “We’re not a radical bunch. We’re not asking for more than any of the other services. We just want fair funding.”  Katherine Warren, 49, from Kea Schools in Trurow, Cornwall, said:  “The amount it takes to run a school is more and more. We’re spending more money on resources such as special needs, professional agencies, educational psychologists - services we didn’t previously pay for. “I don’t know any school that at the very least hasn’t had to reduce hours of staff. It makes it so hard to meet the needs of the children “There’s such pressure to have a lovely, broad balanced curriculum and that’s what we hope to do. We don’t want the children to go out just being able to do English and Maths, we want them to leave as rounded human beings.” Cathy Rowland, 54, from Dobcroft Infant School in Sheffield, said:  “Headteachers are a mild mannered bunch.  “We understand austerity and we’ve made the easier cuts but now when we look ahead the only cuts we’ve got left will seriously damage the education of children.  “I know of schools in Sheffield that have had to reduce their curriculum choices for children, I know of schools that have increased their class sizes, a lot of us have cut teaching hours.  “Our library is still flooded from rain last week. “When you go into education, you don’t expect to end up worrying about whether you’ve got enough buckets in case it rains.” "},{"url":null,"title":"im not your mate labours","story":"NewsBBC Question Time: Labour\u0027s Ian Lavery clashes furiously with Rod Liddle as he declares \u0027I\u0027m not your mate!\u0027Ian Lavery went toe-to-toe with the Spectator writer after he branded Labour a \"raft of hypocrites\" in a fiery clash on BBC Question TimeShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor13:28, 28 SEP 2018Updated13:33, 28 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/politics/video/im-not-your-mate-labours-13323150,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour\u0027s party chairman bellowed I\u0027m not your mate! last night in a furious clash with right-wing columnist Rod Liddle.

They were already braced for the gathering to be dominated by rows over Brexit  but Jeremy Corbyn’s assured speech setting out a bold agenda has deepened the sense of anxiety.   Tory MPs are now thrashing around for a policy agenda to counter the popular appeal of Corbynism.   To add to the unease they are led by a Prime Minister ill-equipped to the task of refashioning Conservatism to fit the new age.   Theresa May’s record in the Home Office should have alerted her party to her inability and unwillingness to engineer reform.   Despite being the longest serving Home Secretary of modern times her time in the department was an exercise in survival rather than modernisation.      There were a few welcome policies such as tackling modern slavery but she did almost nothing during her time to bring about transformative change.   The one reform she did oversee, the creation of elected police and crime commissioners, has produced no noticeable dference beyond providing a regular reminder that the public can easily get voter fatigue  asked to trudge to the ballot box too often.   This cautious way of operating has continued in Downing Street where she has failed to follow through her diagnosis of the country’s problems with any meaningful action to address them.   In less turbulent times a Prime Minister may be able to get away with timid measures but Mrs May is tiptoeing through office during a period when, as one of her MPs has put it, capitalism is in the dock.   Conservative MPs and commentators have finally woken up to the fact that Jeremy Corbyn’s radical agenda is increasingly popular among voters who are witnessing daily the failures of privatisation, globalism and austerity.   Challenging Corbynism is all the harder when Brexit and the Prime Minister’s personality have led to stasis in Downing Street.   In this vacuum Tories are now wrestling with whether to try to offer a pale imitation of Corbyn or rush further to the right with an unapologetic free-market agenda.   All of this is made harder when they look increasingly out of touch with a generation of younger voters who not only resent Brexit but blame the Conservatives for a lack of affordable housing, insecure and low-paid work and burdening them with student debts.   As the Tory MP George Freeman writes in the House Magazine unless Conservative Party “reconnects with them, we risk becoming a rump party of nostalgic nationalists.”   "},{"url":null,"title":"tories mired open revolt days","story":"NewsTories mired in open revolt days before Theresa May addresses make-or-break party conferenceEven serving ministers have clashed over housing, the economy and most of all Brexit - with the civil war set to dominate the get-together in BirminghamShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor14:15, 28 SEP 2018Updated14:17, 28 SEP 2018NewsTheresa May has to persuade EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron... and her own party \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBitter infighting risks tearing apart the Conservatives just hours before thousands of activists descend on the party\u0027s annual conference.  Even serving ministers have clashed over housing, the economy and most of all Brexit - with the civil war set to dominate the get-together in Birmingham.   Today Boris Johnson led the charge by launching his most stinging outburst yet against Theresa May’s Brexit plan. The Chequers blueprint is as “a moral and intellectual humiliation for this country” that will “cheat the electorate”, he wrote in the .   Hard Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg echoed Mr Johnson’s call to chuck the so-called \u0027Chequers\u0027 plan, saying it didn’t “have much le in the sunlight”.   Meanwhile ex-leader Michael Howard has said Mrs May is only safe for a few months in a recording leaked to The Sun. Universities Minister Sam Gyimah wrote that the Tories “have lost our way” and now veer between “talking business down” and “ignoring the concerns of voters.” And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said: “We need to be talking about how people’s lives are getting better.”  The annual get-together in Birmingham will be a make-or-break time for the Prime Minister, whose leadership is under strain as she bids to compromise with the EU to get a Brexit deal. She must rally angry Tory Brexiteers around the plan in her speech on Wednesday, just days before trying to persuade pro-EU leaders of its merits in Brussels.  But Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s focus on domestic poverty, austerity and jobs - together with a slick new campaign video - have led to Tories voicing their fears about the party\u0027s bigger picture.   Ms Truss made her comment at an event in response to the Labour video. She added: That video does capture the heart of where we need to be as a party. Serving minister Mr Gyimah lamented that the hard left have glitzy ambassadors from Stormzy to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Meanwhile on his own side, he said, when we Conservatives veer between talking business down, ignoring voters’ concerns, and telling businesses to shut up – or worse – it is a clear sign we have lost our way. When it comes to our relationship with business, we must unscramble our compass  we are to stand any chance of defeating the hard left.

Judith Kerr has written Mummy Time which is described as an an ironic story of a mum on her mobile phone in the park whilst her toddler gets up to all kinds of wild adventures. In the book a child is shown patting a growling dog, eating bread left by a man feeding ducks off the floor, falling into a pond and climbing a tree all while her mum chats on her mobile phone obliviously.  Kerr, 95, who has sold millions of books including her famous story of a tiger visiting a mother and daughter for tea, said: If a tiger was running down the street, I would probably be the only person to notice it because everybody else is on their mobile phones. People who stare at their mobile phones constantly are missing out because the world is quite interesting. Last year a survey found that the average Briton looks at their phone 28 times a day.  Speaking to the Daily Mirror\u0027s First Time Dads podcast earlier this year, the author said she believes all children just want to read and listen to stories - despite the dferences between le when her daughter was growing up compared to today.   Kerr said: The biggest dference I see between the children today is that they are never on their own - there is always an adult around. We used to walk everywhere and travel on the Paris  on their own. The other day I saw a group of 11 year olds on their own and it was wonderful, as you don\u0027t often see that.  I don\u0027t know whether it is fear but it is a shame. People tend to have only two children nowadays, when I was child they had five and you could manage that in the same way. Children today seem to be much more the centre of everything. Another change in the last 50 years is the increase in technology. She said: I go everywhere by Tube and everybody has got this little thing  and they are staring at it.  I look at people and find it interesting - couples to see  they are getting on, what shoes people are wearing. You are walking down the street and people are looking at this little thing so intently they almost bump into you. And I think that there could be a tiger in the street and no-one would see it except me. She said: I think some people have a rule for their children, no screens on school days which is very sensible so they can see the world. She did have a view on why it might not be the end of the world for children to look at screens not books. She said: When I was child reading was feared like screens are now - people used to say \u0027he always has his nose in a book\u0027 like it was a bad thing.

Daniel and Gemma Cullen, from Rhondda in Wales believe their daughter Caoimhe may have autism and say she is waiting for a formal diagnosis. The pair say she was excluded more than 10 times in just over a year at Tylorstown Primary in Rhonnda Cynon Taf between April 2017 and July 2018, reports Wales Online . The disruption meant Gemma had to leave her job at a nursery. Now in her second year at school, Caoimhe attends one day a week and spends the other four days a week at a special educational needs class at Cwm Clydach Primary. Calling for better understanding of autism and possible autism among teachers and schools, Gemma said Caoimhe has never been allowed to take part in a school play and has been kept indoors at play-time at Tylorstown Primary. “She was suspended around times of school trips or extra curricular activities and during the National Tests,” said Gemma.  “She has had two five-day suspensions for kicking someone and has had three day suspensions and half day suspensions here and there. “We think she has autism, it is some sort of additional needs, but she is still a baby.” Daniel, 32, and Gemma, 29, say she has not yet had a statement of special educational needs, although they believe she has autism and/or other SENs. “We pushed and pushed for an educational psychologist evaluation which concluded that Caoimhe has a lot of autistic traits and is seriously sensory overwhelmed  in school where she can’t cope and recommended four day placement in a dferent, calmer setting,” her mum said. “We have contacted the GP and health visitor for referral to the neurodevelopment team [at hospital in Merthyr] and are still on the waiting list for an appointment. I would like some sort of help. “This has been so disruptive I had to leave my job because the school were phoning me every day to come and get her. I was a senior educator in a nursery, in Porth.” Gemma said she filed a complaint to the pupil discipline and exclusions committee of the governing body of Tylorstown Primary School after her daughter was excluded for five days last term. The committee, in July, upheld that exclusion but found procedures were not followed for one exclusion in 2017.  In a letter to her, dated July 10 this year, a support officer for the governors said: ”The committee considered the decision made by Mrs Tuck to exclude your daughter Caoimhe, for a five day period on 15th June 2018 and, after carefully considering the representations made and all the available evidence, have decided to uphold this exclusion. “The reasons for the committee’s decision are as follows: Members felt that the exclusion was warranted due to the fact that it was in response to serious breaches of the school’s behaviour policy and by allowing Caoimhe to stay in school would seriously harm the education/welfare of her or others in the school. “The Committee will investigate the information you were given as there seems to be some discrepancy with that and advice provided to the headteacher... “...In relation to the alleged unlawful exclusion in October 2017  governors agree that the guidance was not followed. This was acknowledged by the headteacher at the meeting.” The letter goes on to say: “The committee felt the support and level of graduated response that has been put in place by the school over a long period of time for Caoimhe and, plans for her future via a four day placement in the Nurture Class in Cwmclydach Primary School were sufficient, and hope that she settles in well. Because the five-day exclusion in June was a fixed term exclusion of less than 15 days, the Cullens were told they had no right of appeal against it. Meleri Thomas, from National Autistic Society Cymru , said: Around 1 in 100 children are on the autism spectrum. Every autistic child is dferent but many become overwhelmed in school – by the bright lights, loud noises or other children\u0027s unpredictable behaviour. This can result in autistic pupils behaving in ways that seem naughty or disruptive to others when actually they are overwhelmed or distressed. And they can end up being unfairly excluded.

With palaces to live in, plenty of money in the bank and a platform to make a real dference to those in need, it\u0027s dficult to comprehend what more members of the royal family could possibly need.   But it turns out that there\u0027s one thing the Duchess of Cambridge is really keen to have - and it\u0027s something most parents will be able to relate to.    Prince William is currently on a solo trip to Africa and on Tuesday night  he attended the British High Commissioner\u0027s reception in Namibia.  During the event the Duke of Cambridge gave a speech to other guests where he revealed that he was getting to do something this week that his we wasn\u0027t - and she was immensely jealous of it. So what was it that the Duchess was so jealous of? The fact that her husband was enjoying several nights of peaceful sleep away from the kids.    William said: I’m delighted to be visiting Namibia for the first time. I’m only sorry that my we, Catherine, is not able to join me. She is immensely jealous. Particularly because I’m looking forward to a few good, uninterrupted nights’ sleep this week away from my wonderful children. Yesterday it was revealed that the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s maternity leave would soon be coming to an end as Kensington Palace announced her first official engagement since giving birth in April will take place next week.

He added: Although I\u0027ll be on duty from Monday, I\u0027ve made arrangements to stay in contact with City Hall and my team of deputy mayors throughout, and will work as usual in the evenings and on any days where I am not required for jury service.

But silver-tongued legal eagle Nick Freeman - aka \u0027Mr Loophole\u0027 - may never have stepped foot in a courtroom  it hadn\u0027t for a conversation in which he was persuaded to study law rather than become a professional golfer. Over the years he has had some stunning successes as well as fails for the famous faces he represents, including Sir Alex Ferguson, Sarah Harding, Freddie Flintoff, Jeremy Clarkson, Caprice and Paddy McGuinness.  This week, the father-of-two, who also campaigns to save Staffordshire Bull Terriers, hit the headlines when he had David Beckham\u0027s speeding conviction thrown out - thanks to a technicality.  The former footballer, 43, was accused of driving his loaned \u0026pound200,000 Bentley at 59mph in a 40mph zone on the A40 in London\u0027s Paddington just after 5.30pm on January 23.  However, tenacious Mr Freeman, 62, managed to have the trial thrown out because the notice of intended prosecution arrived one day outside the statutory 14-day window.  And it\u0027s not the first time Manchester-based Mr Freeman has successfully defended Beckham .  In 1999 he helped overturn Becks\u0027 eight-month driving disqualication after the former Manchester United star was caught driving his Ferrari at 76 mph in a 50 mph zone. Mr Freeman claimed petried Becks was fleeing the paparazzi for ten miles through Cheshire. After that, his courtroom skills soon brought him to the attention of celebrity clients, including Jimmy Carr, Charlotte Crosby and Dwight Yorke.  He is rumoured to be Britain\u0027s highest paid lawyer, reportedly charging \u0026pound10,000 a day in some instances, and is famed for using technicalities and highlighting procedural errors that force magistrates to throw cases out. Mr Freeman, who runs his own business, graduated from Chester Law School in 1979 and then became a prosecutor for Greater Manchester Police. He used his forensic knowledge of the Road Traffic Act to defend motorists and - ironically - became the scourge of police. Here are some of the celebrities he has represented in court - the winners and losers. The winners Sir Alex Ferguson When Sir Alex Ferguson was caught avoiding a traffic jam by driving down the hard shoulder of a motorway in 1999, Mr Freeman successfully argued Fergie had no choice because he had severe diarrhoea and was rushing to get to the toilet at United’s training ground. Fergie was followed by a police vehicle, stopped and cautioned. He told the court that he was too embarrassed to explain his predicament to the police officer. And Mr Freeman described the situation as an emergency. The former football manager, now 76, was cleared and found not guilty of illegally driving.  Andrew \u0027Freddie\u0027 Flintoff In 2007, ex-cricket star Andrew \u0027Freddie\u0027 Flintoff was accused of driving at 87mph in a temporary 50mph zone on the M62. Mr Freeman pointed out the documents were sent out 16 days after the alleged offence – and the law says the paperwork should be given to the defendant within two weeks. The 40-year-old father-of-three was cleared of speeding as a result. Speaking outside court, Mr Freeman said at the time: It is fundamental in any speeding case that the notice is sent and received within 14 days.  Jeremy Clarkson Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson was charged with speeding at 82mph in a 50mph zone in Ruislip, west London in 2006. But Mr Freeman had the case dropped within minutes. He successfully argued the offending Alfa Romeo had been loaned by the car company and that any of the Top Gear team could have been at the wheel. There was no proof it was Clarkson driving and he was cleared.  Dwight Yorke Yorke, who was playing for Sunderland at the time, was spared a driving ban after pleading guilty to speeding at 85mph. The then 36-year-old had been ing home from a holiday on 8 July 2007 when he was stopped in his car on the A179 in Hartlepool. He refused to sign a police officer\u0027s form and the case was brought to court. Mr Freeman said his client had disagreed with the initial 95mph speed suggested by the officer. He said this is why Yorke, father to Katie Price\u0027s son Harvey, had not signed the documentation at the time. However, he added that the footballer accepted he had been travelling faster than the road\u0027s 70mph speed limit and asked the court to take into consideration his guilty plea for the 85mph charge. The judge fined Yorke \u0026pound315 and gave him three penalty points.  Jimmy Carr Comedian Jimmy Carr was cleared of using a mobile phone whilst driving in 2008. Mr Freeman stated his client wasn’t making a call, but using the device to record a joke. An officer in a marked police patrol car stopped Carr, who was driving his Bentley Continental on the Hampstead Road, Harrow, on January 28, for talking into his iPhone and touching the screen. Mr Freeman argued that his client had not been using the Apple mobile phone to make a call, or for any other interactive purpose, and therefore he didn’t fall foul of this legislation. Speaking after the hearing, Mr Freeman said: “Whenever my client thinks of a joke while driving he uses his iPhone in dictation mode. “Because it was in this particular mode, and not in an interactive one, I pointed out that he hadn’t committed an offence contrary to this legislation.” The case was dismissed after a submission by Mr Freeman of “no case to answer” and Mr Carr was awarded costs from Central Funds.  Ian Brown Stone Roses lead singer Ian Brown escaped with his driving licence intact after being clocked doing 105mph on the M6 after being followed by a police car in 2011. Mr Freeman persuaded the court not to disqualy his client, so that he could continue to pick his son up from school and go to the supermarket for his elderly parents. Mr Freeman added: As somebody who is now in the public eye, one can imagine the dficulties he would now encounter  he were forced to rely on public transport. It would be literally insurmountable. Brown initially denied he had been travelling at such a speed, but later pleaded guilty. The court fined Brown \u0026pound650 and gave him six penalty points on his licence.  Paddy McGuinness Paddy McGuinness escaped a driving ban with the help of lawyer Mr Freeman despite the TV comic earlier pleading guilty. The Take Me Out star had originally admitted a charge of failing to give information relating to the identication of a driver in 2017. It came after his Range Rover was caught speeding in August last year and carries six penalty points, which would have taken Mr McGuinness to 12 - and a mandatory ban. But between entering a plea and sentencing, he sought legal advice from Mr Freeman, who told him to withdraw the plea and go to trial. Mr Freeman said that his client had moved house three times in two years and had not received either a notice of intended prosecution or a reminder. He had only become aware of the case after receiving a single justice procedure notice  and asked for a photo of the car speeding, which it was said he also never received. The case was dismissed. Speaking after the hearing Mr Freeman said: “Mr McGuinness’s Range Rover was caught speeding on August 8, 2016, but my client did not believe he was the driver, as his car was having some work undertaken at about that time. “Mr McGuinness did not receive the notice of intended prosecution, nor the reminder, that were both allegedly sent to his home address. “My client is obviously relieved to have been found not guilty.  The losers Caprice Bourret Model Caprice Bourret was banned for driving for a year and ordered to pay \u0026pound3,500 after admitting to drink-driving in 2005. A court heard that she had drunk two bottles of red wine and eaten only a salad when she was arrested after police saw her Mercedes had a defective fog light. At an earlier hearing the model had pleaded guilty to drink-driving. Mr Freeman argued that she should escape a driving ban because the alcohol in her blood had not left her system as quickly as normal because she had taken prescription medication for cystitis. But District Judge Emma Arbuthnot at Highbury Corner magistrates\u0027 court dismissed her claim. Mr Freeman said his client had not given police the intimate details at the time because she feared they would be leaked to the press. He had earlier told the court that the model had been given 20 antibiotics pills to fight her infection and that she had been taking them for five days before her arrest. Mr Freeman said: She believed that the alcohol would have more or less dissipated. She felt more or less all right.  Barbara Knox Coronation Street star Barbara Knox was banned from the road after turning up at a police station ‘intoxicated’ to see her daughter who had also been arrested for drink driving. The 84-year-old, who plays much-loved Rita Tanner in the soap, had seen her daughter Maxine Ashcroft taken into custody after the pair were pulled over in Knutsford on March 10, 2014. And Knox was ‘emotional’ and ‘slurring her words’ as she arrived at Knutsford Police Station later that evening, a court heard. She was carrying a set of car keys and suspecting she had driven there, police warned her not to drive again as she may be arrested. They even offered the actress, who has been in ITV show for more than four decades, a lt home, Jonathan Egan prosecuting said, however she declined. Officers then followed her to the car park and saw her get into a Jaguar and begin reversing out of a bay, the court was told. Officers found she had 85mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, narrowly over the limit of 80. She was banned from the road for a year and fined \u0026pound3,000. Mr Freeman told the court: “Drink driving is a serious offence and she in no way seeks to justy or condone her terrible error of judgement. “In many ways she was the author of her own misfortune. “This was an unnecessary offence.  Sarah Harding Girls Aloud star Sarah Harding said she had learned her lesson after being banned from driving for six months for using her mobile phone while driving. The singer was on her phone while at the wheel of her silver Range Rover in April 2013 in central London but refused to pull over when an officer on a bicycle tried to flag her down. Mr Freeman told the court Hardy had just signed up to be a charity ambassador and that a driving ban would hamper her ability to undertake the role. He added: She was part of a girl group called Girls Aloud and she is on the threshold of a new solo career. She would find it impossible to travel in public transport, she would be constantly harangued. But District Judge Nina Tempia said: Mr Freeman is asking the court to deal with you as opposed to a normal person but you are a normal person as far as the court is concerned. She ordered Harding to pay a \u0026pound500 fine, plus a costs order of \u0026pound85 and a victim surcharge of \u0026pound20 for talking on her mobile phone while driving. A second charge of failing to stop for police was dropped.  Charlotte Crosby Reality TV star Charlotte Crosby was found guilty of drink driving in 2016. The Geordie Shore star was handed a three-year driving ban after being caught more than twice the legal limit during a drive in Newcastle. Crosby was also ordered to pay court costs of \u0026pound1,185 while appearing in Newcastle Magistrate\u0027s Court. Her lawyer Mr Freeman told the court the star had originally planned to get a taxi for her journey from the railway station to her hotel, but instead decided to drive. She was pulled over by two police officers after they witnessed her \u0027weaving down the road\u0027 and was subsequently found to be twice over the legal limit. At the time, Mr Freeman said Charlotte accepts that she is the author of her misfortune while adding that she is: Bitterly ashamed, contrite and embarrassed.  His daughter - Sophie Freeman In 2010, Mr Freeman refused to defend his own daughter, Sophie, after she she had been slapped with a speeding ticket. He said he wanted the then 19-year-old to learn her lesson from the punishment. At the time he said: Mr Loophole the lawyer was in conflict with Mr Loophole the dad. Every fibre of my parental instinct told me that Sophie had to understand the consequences of breaking the law and that speeding can be a serious and dangerous issue. I\u0027m a hypocrite. I know. His daughter was driving back from the family\u0027s apartment in North Wales when she was clocked doing 63mph in a temporary 50mph zone. She was driving a Mini Cabriolet registered to her father\u0027s law firm. A letter arrived at the company\u0027s offices days later stating that its driver faced a \u0026pound60 fine and three licence points.  Mr Loophole himself In 2012 Mr Freeman was fined \u0026pound60 after failing to renew his MOT on his \u0026pound200k Bentley Azure. After being stopped on the M1 near Milton Keynes he said: “The grinning copper, chuffed at netting such a prize catch, informed me that I wasn’t under arrest but that my MoT had expired.” He said he did not book a test as he did not get a reminder letter from his garage Mr Freeman said he had called his Bentley garage in the summer asking them to let him know when his MoT was due. He added: “In fact as I explained all this to the police officer who stopped me, I rang the garage there and then to find out what had happened. They told me a letter had gone to my office in October. However, clearly it was never received and got \u0027lost in the post\u0027. But because I hadn’t had a reminder, I hadn’t done anything about the MOT.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ms basically selling red velvet","story":"NewsM\u0026S now sells red velvet cake spread in a jar - and we\u0027re here for itIf you love cake - and who doesn\u0027t love cake - you\u0027re going to want to pick this Red Velvet Curd upShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByStacey Williams14:11, 28 SEP 2018Updated15:14, 28 SEP 2018NewsThe spread was spotted by an Instagram user \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMarks \u0026amp Spencer has released some new spreads just in time for the festive season - and one of them is basically cake in a jar.

A blast of icy conditions blowing in from the Arctic will push thermometers below zero and could herald snow in Scotland and northern parts of England. Much of the UK is basking in warm summer conditions with temperatures hitting 25C in some parts of the country - but experts say the Indian summer is about to come to an abrupt end. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “It is going to turn colder towards the weekend with a northerly flow of Arctic air bringing temperatures down compared to earlier in the week. “Friday will feel colder and we could see some patchy frosts first thing, daytime temperatures will reach the mid-teens at best and it will feel colder in the north.  “Overnight into Saturday we could see more widespread frosts with temperatures widely dropping, anywhere in the country could see a frost. “It will stay cooler into Sunday and after some morning fog there is the likelihood of sunny spells with daytime temperatures around the mid-teens again.” Gale-force winds will also affect northern parts of the country, she warned. She added: “There will be blustery showers around on Saturday and along northern coasts there will be the risk of gales. “Across the southern half of the country there is more of a chance of seeing some sunshine, the risk of frosts will continue into the start of next week. “There may be some sleet or wet snow over high ground in the north on Sunday night.” Temperatures are forecast to hit -2 in Scotland while Wales and the north of England will see single digit figures. Earlier this week, forecasters suggested Britain could be set for more snow than ever before over the coming months .    The UK could see weeks of snow over the Christmas period as bookmakers say the country could be facing the coldest winter on record. And Coral bookmakers have slashed the odds at 6-4 for this winter to be the coldest on record.

Britain is set to cool down as a change in wind direction triggers the start of a colder and windier period of weather across much of the country. The blast of freezing air will push thermometers below zero and could herald snow in Scotland and northern parts of England. A balmy south-westerly air flow has kept temperatures unseasonably above average over the past few days under widespread sunny skies. But values are expected to drop suddenly and sharply as winds revert to a chillier northerly airflow from Greenland and Iceland over the weekend.  According to the Met Office temperatures will soon fall to close to or a little below normal. The mercury could even plummet into single figures or lower in parts of Scotland, with temperatures struggling to reach any higher than 10C. Elsewhere, figures will linger around the low to-mid teens C – a stark contrast from Thursday\u0027s 23C high in the south-east. Brits will begin to notice a change from Friday as values start to tumble as a cold front tracks across the UK. Hannah Findley, forecaster of The Weather Channel, said: Through Friday and Saturday, a long cold front will cross the UK and much of continental Europe. Temperatures will reduce sharply behind the front, for example, maximum temperatures in London will be 23C on Thursday but 16C on Friday. The weather associated with this front will be patchy cloud and light rain or drizzle. Behind the front, the strengthening north-westerly winds will lead to wind chill, and in the wind it will feel like temperatures are in the single figures.    Heading into the weekend, it will turn unusually chilly for the time of year as a strengthening Atlantic weather system begins to push polar air from Greenland and Iceland towards Britain. The worst of the cool weather will be in the northern half of the country as temperatures decline sharply, with the odd shower likely. High pressure will remain in charge further south, meaning conditions will stay largely dry and bright but cool - possibly feeling 3-4C colder in the brisk wind chill. The nights are expected to be quite cold too, alongside a risk of frost and fog. Katie Greening, forecaster of The Weather Channel, said: There is a risk for a scattered frost on Saturday morning and possibly Monday morning too. It\u0027ll remain cool over the weekend but it should feel particularly nippy Monday with highs of only 10-14C in a straight northerly airflow - temperatures 4C lower than the seasonal norm.

According to local media, 36 passengers and 11 crew members were on board and all were rescued, with locals using their boats to take people to safety.

The Tiki Beach bar is one of Benidorm’s most famous and liveliest pubs on the Costa Blanca and attracts thousands of UK holidaymakers every year. But it will close its doors soon after an order was approved by the Spanish Supreme Court, according to news source Diario Informacion . The bar, which takes pride of place on the Levante Beach, is on the top of the tourist pub crawl list as revellers flock there. But it has been the subject of a string of complaints from neighbours in the Santa Margarita building over the years, including loud music and boozy tourists partying on the beach until the early hours.  And it is now said the Spanish court has ruled in favour of the residents and ordered the closure of the pub in a decision that can’t be appealed. The news has shocked British tourists who say Tiki Beach is the best bar in Benidorm. Alan Gray, 57, of Northumberland, says Benidorm won’t be the same without it. Alan told ChronicleLive: “I can’t believe it that Tiki Beach is closing. I have been going for the past 13 years with a group of lads for St Paddy’s Day. “We always end up at Tiki Beach because the atmosphere is great, the drinks are reasonably priced and the music is good. “And, of course, don’t forget the vistas - it looks out onto Levante Beach and it’s just a great place to have a few beers. “OK there is a party atmosphere that spills out onto the promenade but I have never seen any trouble there in all the years I’ve been going, just lots of holidaymakers having loads of fun. “In fact, I’m going to Benidorm with another set of friends next week, I hope it hasn’t closed by then.”  Karen Hamilton, of Whitley Bay, added: “This is such a shame for Benidorm holidaymakers. It always has a great party atmosphere and a great meeting spot. Tiki Beach is such an integral part of a Benidorm holiday. Thousands of Geordies will be gutted.” Kirsha Knowles, 42, of Newcastle, said: “I am absolutely devastated that it is closing. Tiki Beach is the heart of a Benidorm holiday. “I’ve been going there regularly with my family and with the girls for the past ten years or more. There is always a great atmosphere. Benidorm won’t be the same without it. I’m really gutted, honestly I am.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man wielding machete stands over","story":"NewsMan wielding machete stands over blood-soaked victim begging for his le on Barcelona street as tourists stroll byThe 25-year-old victim was spotted lying in a pool of blood in the notorious Ravel district of Barcelona in Spain early this morningShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills12:57, 28 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/world-news/video/man-wielding-machete-stands-over-13324351,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man wielding a huge machete was filmed threatening a man in the street as he lay injured begging for mercy.

Dundee will be hoping they can buck the trend – and they do have some form for it.Try to recall horric starts in the top flight for clubs – St Mirren in 2014, Livingston in 2005, Hamilton 1989, Dumbarton 1984 and Morton 1987 – and they all end in the same horror show of the drop.In 2014, the Buddies had to wait till their sixth game before picking up points, ending in bottom spot with 30 points. Post-administration Livingston took a massive 15 games to get a victory in 2005 with just one point from their first seven.You get the idea.For the Dark Blues, though, there is a small chink of sunshine, a ray of hope for the most optimistic fans to cling on to despite having no points from the first six games.The ‘12th team’ season was a poor one, of course, with plenty of reasons behind a dreadful start.A side built to get promotion from the First Division was suddenly parachuted into the top flight as Rangers were booted out.And Barry Smith’s side struggled badly. However, by this point, even they had four points from their first six games.Overall, though, nine losses in 11 games was a recipe for disaster and ended with relegation in bottom spot with 30 points.Head back to 1993 and Simon Stainrod’s final few games in charge tell a similar story to Dundee’s current predicament.No wins to their name, two draws however, led to Stainrod being moved from a manager role to director of football with his No 2 Jim Duffy taking over.They eventually beat Hearts on October 2, 1993, with goals from Garry Paterson and Dragutin Ristic.In the first of his three spells as gaffer at Dens, Duffy as player-manager couldn’t keep the Dark Blues from finishing in bottom spot – a side that eventually included a very young Neil McCann.However, head back to the early 80s and a spell where Dundee were perennially bad starters to seasons.Starting in 1980/81, Donald Mackay’s Dark Blues certainly weren’t early risers.In the First Division, that season saw no wins in the opening seven matches with two 0-0 draws at least putting something on the board.Remarkably, they didn’t manage to score a single goal in the league until the fth game.Brian Scrimgeour broke that duck in a 2-1 defeat at Hibs before they finally managed a victory at the eighth time of asking.That saw Eric Sinclair grab two along with goals from John Fletcher and Peter Mackie in a 4-0 success over Falkirk.Fast forward to the end of the campaign and that sluggish start didn’t hurt too much as Mackay’s men won promotion to the top flight, finishing second to Hibs, scoring 64 goals on the way.Two campaigns later and it was a similar story to today.The Dark Blues were yet to pick up a victory in the Premier Division by October 1 in 1983/84.At that time, there had only been five league games by that point with a League Cup group stage taking up the early fixtures.Only a 0-0 draw with St Mirren gave them anything before two own goals from Motherwell got them up and running.Eventually, Mackay’s reign came to an end in December of that year.In his place came Archie Knox to keep them in the ision, finishing four points ahead of St Johnstone.Signings like John Brown and Robert Connor saw Knox transform the Dark Blues into a solid mid-table outfit before Jocky Scott took over for the first time in 1986 and continued that.Dundee have history of getting themselves out of bad starts – whether they stick like they did with Mackay or twist with someone like Knox, they have previous.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton boss martin canning wont be shed a tear for under pressure dundee counterpart neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHamilton boss Martin Canning insists he cannot afford to take any notice of Neil McCann’s plight ahead of Saturday’s clash with bottom side Dundee.Pressure is piling on the Dens Park manager after six straight Ladbrokes Premiership defeats and a Betfred Cup exit to Ayr United.However, Canning noted his side beat St Mirren 3-0 at home on Saturday for their first win in four matches, to give Accies some respite of their own.He said: “You’ve got to go and do your own job and my job on Saturday is to try to get Hamilton Accies three points and  we can do that we’ll be delighted.“That’s just football.

They want to have the target of promotion and winning the league.“This is pressure, this is normal but you have to understand we have a budget that isn’t any higher than other teams in the main.“You have to bring a team together. We had 19 players leave and 16 players come in for the new season.“We can’t click our fingers and have the team work fantastically.“There are rules at the club about how many or which kind of players we can bring in within our budget.“It is not easy, we are not Manchester City with an owner behind you who can give you £20 million to go and spend.“We have to work with the budget we have to get the best for the club.“The Dundee United board have done a fantastic job. It is not easy to convince players from abroad to come to the Scottish Championship with everything else around.”It was quite a defence – but probably one that was coming after weeks of trying to keep a lid on it following poor results against Alloa and Morton.Yes, he has not had his troubles to seek with injury and scrutiny from all angles but it seems to be just the beginning for Csaba in his most tough of jobs.In the next four weeks they take on title rivals Ross County, Ayr United, Partick Thistle and Inverness. They kick off that run at home to County on Saturday.“I don’t just look at one game being more important than the other because you can’t afford to take any game lightly,” Csaba added. “You have to take every opponent seriously, whether they be at the top, middle or bottom of the league.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"                          POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"                          AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged \u0026pound490 million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-glasgow-bar-named-scotlands-pub-of-the-year","story":"                          A Glasgow pub has been named the best in Scotland at a prestigious award ceremony."},{"url":null,"title":"lewis-morgan-kris-boyd-hasnt-a-clue-whats-going-on-inside-celtic-weve-a-close-knit-group-of-players","story":"                          LEWIS Morgan has denied that Celtic have struggled this season due to a split in the dressing room - and vowed to play his part in helping the Parkhead club get back to winning ways."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-cabbies-set-for-new-compulsory-qualification-to-stay-on-the-road","story":"                          Cabbies could soon be forced to gain a professional qualication to remain on Glasgow\u0026rsquo roads."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-staff-to-take-industrial-action","story":"                          SCOTRAIL staff are to take industrial action in a dispute over pay for working on rest days."},{"url":null,"title":"independent-review-of-football-policing-strategy-ordered","story":"                          AN independent expert will be commissioned to review policing at football matches."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-more-pupils-to-learn-cpr-as-8th-council-backs-evening-times-campaign","story":"                          INVERCLYDE has become the eighth council to commit to teaching all pupils le-saving CPR, in support of our Scotland\u0027 Got Heart Campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"rutherglen-trampoline-park-to-transform-into-drive-in-cinema-for-halloween","story":"                          A RUTHERGLEN trampoline park will transform itself into a spooky, drive in cinema for Halloween."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-woman-who-brings-the-biggest-stars-to-glasgow","story":"                          OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the world\u0027s biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair-cancels-250-flights-what-to-do-if-youre-affected","story":"                          Frustrated passengers were grounded on Friday after striking staff forced Ryanair to cancel around 250 flights, potentially affecting tens of thousands of customers across Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"everyman-cinema-glasgow-opening-date-announced","story":"                          A new boutique cinema will be opening in the City Centre at the end of next month."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock-and-hamilton-jobs-to-go-as-powerleague-to-shut-two-sites","story":"                          WORKERS at two five-a-side football pitch complexes are facing the axe as Powerleague announced the closure of its west Scotland sites."},{"url":null,"title":"take-that-fans-left-disappointed-after-glasgow-ticket-fiasco","story":"                          Take That fans have been left disappointed after failing to get their hands on tickets for their greatest hits show."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"                          AN English couple have decided to raffle off their \u0026pound3 million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117769.jpg","title":"Blainie 9 defies the odds in charity race","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn 2016, Blainie White  was diagnosed with a form of Batten disease which affects just eight people in the UK.

Furthermore, they are perfect for underfloor heating.Eric adds “Porcelain tiles, once installed, will stay flat. Wood and particularly wood laminates can curl up over time, so they are perfect for use both indoors and outdoors.“But don’t forget – wooden effect tiling is not just restricted to the floor they can even be used on walls and other vertical surfaces.”Visit Aberdeen Tiles extensive showroom to meet their friendly, expert team and see the likeliness of wooden effect tiles for yourself.Find out more at the Aberdeen Tile website. 100vw, 424px\" /With the darker nights approaching, now is the right time to consider a health check on your home or workplace electrics – so call the experts at SWES!Today, there are so many safety measures and checks that we undertake in day-to-day le – whether it be an MOT to ensure cars are safe to drive or an annual service on boiler and gas appliances.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC.

On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

They heard there is a stigma associated with talking about loneliness and isolation but people of all ages are at risk of being lonely. It often occurs at times of change in people’s lives such as leaving home, starting a family, retirement or bereavement.A recent survey over the whole of NHS Highland, including Mid Argyll, found that 67 per cent of older people sometimes feel lonely and for eight per cent of respondents this increased to often feeling extremely lonely.Cumlodden Guild signed up to NHS Highland’s campaign called Reach Out – make a dference to someone who’s lonely, making a pledge to raise awareness in the church congregation and to talk about loneliness and isolation in their local communities.Alison McGrory said: \u0026#8216My job is about preventing health problems before they arise and enabling people to lead as healthy a le as possible. Loneliness is a bigger public health risk than physical activity or weight management and causes as many premature deaths as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. This is a compelling reason to take action.\u0026#8216NHS Highland’s Reach Out campaign has been developed to encourage more people to think about the part they can play in reducing loneliness. It costs nothing to reach out a hand of kindness and say hello to someone in the street or knock on a neighbour’s door to check they are OK.\u0026#8216You can sign up to the Reach Out campaign on facebook at NHS Highland Reach Out.\u0026#8217Sue Campbell of Cumlodden Church Guild said: \u0026#8216Cumlodden Church Guild is delighted to sign up to the Reach Out campaign. We are aware that isolation is an issue throughout Mid Argyll – some people live alone and others live in remote areas and find it dficult to get out and about. We are all now much more aware of the health issues associated with loneliness and are going to spread the word amongst our wider congregation and with our friends and neighbours.\u0026#8217PIC:Members have reached out to anyone suffering from loneliness or isolation. no_a39CumloddenLoneliness01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"feathers fly as legion floats fundraisers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/09/18, 1:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt was a busy weekend of fun and fundraising for Inveraray branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.A very well attended annual coffee morning and children\u0026#8217s bake-off took place at Inveraray Church Hall on Saturday September 22.Ashley McDougall won the 10 to 14 years age group, while Abbie and Ollie  McKinley won the eight to 10 category and, Emilie MacDonald the eight and under contest.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op.32 No.12 as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer?Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse/harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills 2,000 years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead \u0026#8211 now wasted \u0026#8211 would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year\u0026#8217s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall \u0026#8211 this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £700 at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers \u0026#8211 Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £915.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The 10-year-olds ranked in the top 46 out of a whopping 600 youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing and  they liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P7 St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November 25 when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of 500 people and a panel of guest judges. And the youngsters only have 15 seconds left to learn of their 90-second dance. The cha-cha couple will also be fundraising to raise more monies for the charity. Good luck Jake and Olivia – and keep dancing!

The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire. We want to encourage young people to take up the sport of golf.” Claire Monaghan, council head of community services and facilities, told the Leadership Panel: “ A lot of working is going on to pull all the strands together.” The politicians agreed the Ayrshire Golf Trust, which is spearheading the venture, could go ahead and apply for funding. She said there is a risk funds may be unavailable  there is a delay in applying. So far the The Ayrshire Golf Trust has consulted with local golf clubs, the public and residents.

the Scottish Government, the percentage of premises connected to fibre broadband in the Borders would be 39.3 per cent, rather than the current 91.4 per cent.\n\u0026ldquoThis report recognises that

Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour.

We should seriously consider whether we are to spend £90,000 on a new school only four miles away.\u0026#8217Buses carrying pupils from RAF Machrihanish would have to pass through Campbeltown dropping secondary pupils and then go on to Drumlemble.Referring to a letter of protest issued by a Drumlemble Parents\u0026#8217 Association, the provost said that  the villagers had agreed on a site, they could have had a new school a long time ago.He said things had some to a head with the appointment of the new headmaster.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe artistic monument of silver-grey granite gted by Mr Peter Jeffrey Mackie of Glenreasdell, to commemorate the men from the district who fell in the war, was unveiled at Whitehouse on Sunday last by Sir Thomas Mackenzie, K.C.M.G.The ceremony was opened with prayer by Rev.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.

She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.  She interviews the recruits, who, after initial training, get to \u0026lsquoshadow\u0026rsquo a general adviser before going it alone with support from the session supervisor.  Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is interesting and is good  you can be of some use to people.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom at the CAB for half a day twice a week.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday, October 14.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip.

The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.

Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.  Already the family have completed three events, with Elaine, 33, running the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen in May. Then Elaine lined up alongside Clare, 32, Kara, 29, Duncan, 28, and Susan for the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, in July.  The youngest members of the squad did their bit at the parkrun in Portrush, Northern Ireland, with Susan joined by Laura, 37, eight-year-old Isla, 14-year-old Ciara and Elaine.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.  Now the runners are in the home straight and each of them has been overwhelmed by the generosity of members of the public.  Initially a fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 was set before that was increased to \u0026pound3,000, but both figures have been smashed.  Susan added: \u0026ldquoI think the challenge itself was original and caught people\u0026rsquos imagination but the total is not because of us.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of what Jenner was to so many people.

Yard of Ale was originally formed in 1972 when Ian Lawson, Alistair McDougald and Colin Mackenzie all found themselves in Musselburgh.  Alistair and Colin had married local girls and Ian had taken up a post in youth and community education. He also later married a Musselburgh girl.  All three had dabbled in folk music in the past and regularly went to the Golf Tavern in Millhill, Musselburgh, to hear local folk singers, the Amulree Trio, Chris Egan and his daughters, Lorraine and Karen.  Alistair explained: \"We each would sing a few songs inidually in the trio\u0026rsquos break. One week John Gillan, the owner of the pub, asked  we could try and fill a night when the Amulrees were unavailable.  \"We had a practice, everything just clicked and Yard Of Ale was born. We played every Friday and Saturday at the Golf for three years and took our name from the yard glass which hung on the wall. We were encouraged by local comedian, Billy Nimmo , to try our hand in the club cabaret scene.\"  Yard Of Ale then had many successful years on the pub and club circuit, winning the TV Times \u0027Pub Entertainers of the Year\u0027 award. The band did well on ITV\u0027s \u0027New Faces\u0027 and appeared on many television and radio shows including STV\u0026rsquos \u0027Thingummyjig\u0027 and BBC Radio Scotland\u0026rsquos \u0027Scottish Radio Orchestra Roadshow.\u0027 During this time they also supported, amongst others, Matt McGinn, Hamish Imlach and Billy Connolly, and enjoyed an extended run in the Edinburgh Festival with the legendary Tim Hardin.  They then went their separate ways with Alistair involved in solo cabaret work, Colin playing with the North Sea Gas folk group and Iain, the original guitarist, leading a rock band.  In 1992 the group reformed for a charity show at the Brunton Theatre with good friends The Mimics, a successful Musselburgh comedy showband who had also broken up previously, to mark the passing of their mentor Billy Nimmo. The event was so successful that the band decided to give it another go.  Since then its popularity has continued to grow and it has been in great demand for concerts, folk festivals, corporate s, pub, hotel and club gigs all over Scotland and when on tour in Denmark and in Ireland.  Peter Gillan, nephew of the Golf\u0026rsquos John Gillan, then joined the band when Ian retired in 1998. Having spent many years playing solo as a singer and guitarist on the folk and country scenes, his experience added yet another dimension to the band.  Walter Mowat joined Yard Of Ale in 2015 when Colin retired. Over the years he has played in a number of folk and bluegrass bands and also plays violin in the Really Terrible Orchestra.  Ian and Colin still occasionally feature with the band as deputies or for larger concerts.  Alistair and Ian each have two sons who were brought up and educated in Musselburgh.  Alistair\u0026rsquos sons were both taught at the Burgh School by Susan Macintosh, Peter\u0026rsquos we.  Peter started his working le at Brunton\u0026rsquos Wiremill and still works for Brunton Aero products as it is now.

The 21-year-old ran 100 kilometres to do her bit for the charity, which is close to her heart after her gran, Margaret Taylor, had dementia for about seven years.  Rhona said: \u0026ldquoI think as well as getting the donations throughout, it really did spur me on knowing I was doing something in memory of my gran.  \u0026ldquoSo many other people were doing the same challenge and being part of something bigger really helped.  \u0026ldquoThere were a lot of days where I did not want to go out for a run, especially in the heatwave.  \u0026ldquoIt was quite hard some days to keep going.  According to Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK, more than 1,700 people across the county have been diagnosed with dementia, with that figure expected to double within the next 20 years.  University student Rhona previously told the Courier she was not a keen athlete but found she had come on leaps and bounds during the challenge, which she finished at the end of August.  She said: \u0026ldquoI really improved.  \u0026ldquoI think for the first month, the improvement was so slow and I was pretty worried but one of my last runs was an eight-kilometre run.  \u0026ldquoI could only run about a tenth of that in the beginning.  \u0026ldquoOnce I got over that hump, it was crazy \u0026ndash I was adding a kilometre every week to my personal best.  \u0026ldquoFor me, time did not really matter.  \u0026ldquoIt kind of came naturally and when I did shorter runs I was noticing I was getting a lot quicker but for me it was really about getting the distances since it seemed so unreachable for me in the beginning.  Rhona got involved with Dementia Friendly Haddington when she was still at Knox Academy.  She co-organised an event with fellow Knox pupil Kate Farmer at Haddington Day Centre, which saw an entire music class provide entertainment.  Since then, she has done her bit for dementia and Alzheimer-related charities, raising \u0026pound546 through the challenge, and has not ruled out lacing up her running shoes again in the future after finding it not only improved her fitness but her mental health too.  Speaking on Friday morning, the fourth year studying film at Edinburgh Napier University added: \u0026ldquoGenuinely, the reason I missed your call was I was about to go for a run.  \u0026ldquoThat would be my first since I finished the challenge.  \"I took a week off, I think I earned a week off but I am going to try to keep it up.  \u0026ldquoI expected to get fitter but did not really expect how much of an impact it would have on my mood.  \u0026ldquoJust genuinely you go for a run and there is no way you are going to feel bad afterwards.

The inquiry earlier how heard DUP spad Timothy Cairns claimed he sought advice from another party spad Dr Andrew Crawford while they worked on a policy in delaying the introduction of cost-controls.  Mr Johnston, the DUP\u0026rsquos most senior official, said he \u0026ldquocouldn\u0026rsquot recall a phone conversation with Mr Cairns in August 2015 in which they spoke about the delay of cost-control.

However, Mr Johnston said he had \u0026ldquono memory of that conversation and denied ever receiving a emailed submission from Dr Crawford about RHI.  \u0026ldquoI would not have been surprised  the two men were interacting on DETI  business, he said.  When probed about the email sent by Dr Crawford, he said he never opened it and left to go on holiday.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-bafta-scotland-calls-for-more-women-in-film-as-2018-short-lists-unveiled","story":"  Jude MacLaverty said the lack of women in major categories for this year\u0026rsquos awards are a \u0026ldquoreflection of the industry, and that film and TV production companies simply \u0026ldquoneed to give women jobs.  The Scottish made thriller Calibre leads this year\u0026rsquos nominations, with five.  However there is no women in the best director categories for either factual or fiction, or the writer for film and television category.  : Trainspotting 2 triumphs at Bafta Scotland awards  Karen Gillan\u0026rsquos debut feature film as a writer and a director, The Party\u0026rsquos Just Beginning, is in the running for best feature film, as is the zombie comedy drama Anna and the Apocalypse and Nae Pasaran, the documentary about Scottish workers who helped sabotage the Chilean dictator General Pinochet.  Gillan\u0026rsquos film was produced by Claire Mundell, of Glasgow\u0026rsquos Synchronicity Films.  Last year, the best factual director went to Louise Lockwood for Fair Isle: Living on the Edge, and Hope Dickson Leach won the best writer category for The Levelling.  This year the short list for the best factual director is John MacLaverty for Scotland 78: A Love Story, Matt Pinder for Violent Men: Behind Bars, and Felipe Bustos Serra for Nae Pasaran, while the best director, fiction, category, features Armando Iannucci for The Death of Stalin, Colm McCarthy for Black Mirror: Black Museum and Matt Palmer for Calibre.  Palmer is also in the best writer category, as is Iannucci and David Kane, for Shetland.  : Iannucci given special award by BAFTA Scotland  BAFTA Scotland said that only 18% of entrants to the writer category were women, 21% of entrants to the director of fiction category, and 31% for the director of factual category.  A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoGiving more talented women the opportunity is one of BAFTA Scotland focuses at present, and we will continue we will continue to work with colleagues in London to look at ways to help redress this balance through initiatives such as our BAFTA Guru New Talent initiative and hope to see more women represented next year.  Women film makers are featured in the categories for Short Film, Features and Factual Series.  Ms MacLaverty noted the lack of women in key categories, and said: \u0026ldquoIt is something that BAFTA, at ground level are always trying to push and try and do something about.  \u0026ldquoIt is a reflection of the industry at the moment, and the jury can only work with what they have - but BAFTA at every level, from panellists to juries, which were 54% female, are aware of this.  The award ceremony for this year\u0026rsquos British Academy of Film and Television Arts in Scotland is on November 4 in Glasgow.  Ms MacLaverty added: \u0026ldquoI might even say it on the night of the ceremony: people just need to employ women, they need to give them the jobs.  \u0026ldquoI love the actress who said: \u0026lsquoTo casting people, could this part be a woman?\u0026rsquo  \u0026ldquoFrom what I hear, Scotland has never been busier, and crews are being really stretched, and so we are doing a lot of work to fill some training gaps, and I see a lot more women taking part.  Edith Bowman, who is host of the awards, noted: \u0026ldquoIt is not a criticism of Bafta - it is the production companies: women need to be given the opportunity when the production is being put together for cast and crew.  Ms Bowman said she hoped grassroots work by BAFTA will increase female involvement in the short lists next year.  Ms MacLaverty said that the judging panels are only looking for \u0026ldquoexcellence in each category.  : Letters - Hard work\u0026nbspno match for structural inequality  Ms Bowman added: \u0026ldquoThe British Academy Scotland Awards is an exceptional event that champions the very best in creativity and production in Scotland and I am delighted to be ing to host this year.  \u0026ldquoAs an organisation BAFTA Scotland plays such an important role in the support and development of creative talent as well as providing a real platform for recognition.  The best actress in a film category features Ella Hunt, Shauna Macdonald and Sian Phillips., whereas the actress on television prize is between Morven Christie, Kiran Sonia Sawar and Elaine C Smith, for her role in Two Doors Down.  The best actor category will guarantee a Scottish BAFTA for the thriller Calibre, as it features three actors from the film, which was shown on Netflix: Tony Curran, Jack Lowden and Martin McCann.

It emerged on Wednesday that Tory MP David Rutley, a former executive at Asda and PepsiCo, had been given the brief at the Department of Agriculture earlier this month.  The UK government\u0026rsquos own analysis has suggested there could be shortages of food supplies after a No Deal Brexit because of logjams at ports and knock on effects on road haulage.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Ms Sturgeon was asked by SNP MSP Rona Mackay  the possibility of rationing should mean a stop to \u0026ldquothis Brexit madness.  Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoThis news would have made most people across the UK stop in their tracks. The Tories\u0026rsquo stewardship of Brexit and the UK as a whole is proving so catastrophic that they have had to appoint a minister for food supplies, which is the first time that such a post has been held since world war two.  \u0026ldquoHow has it come to this situation? It is shameful, and it should be a source of shame for a long time to come for every member of the Conservative Party.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that it will not come to food rationing in this country.  \u0026ldquoIf there ever comes a day when there is food rationing in this country because of a Tory Brexit, perhaps the first people who should bear the burden of that are Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg, David Davis and Michael Gove - all people who perpetrated a dishonesty on the people of this country. We will see how they enjoy their Brexit bonanza.  Mr Rutley said this week: \u0026ldquoIt is an honour to join the Defra ministerial team at such an important time.

The government gave the loan to Ferguson Marine, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde, in September 2017 after it experienced cash flow problems.  At the time, it was falling behind on a \u0026pound97m government contract for two new CalMac ferries.  However Finance Secretary Derek Mackay did not tell Holyrood\u0026rsquos finance committee about the loan until April, a few weeks before he publicly announced another \u0026pound30m loan to Ferguson\u0026rsquos.  He later confirmed the money was needed to ensure the firm\u0027s \"viability\".  Ferguson Marine is part of the Clyde Blowers empire created by Monaco-based tycoon Jim McColl, who sits on the First Minister\u0027s Council of Economic Advisers.  The two loans are given a \"very brief\" paragraph in the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consolidated accounts for 2017-18, which were published on Thursday.  They are described as a \u0026ldquostrategic investment in Scotland\u0026rsquos industrial capability.  In its accompanying report, Audit Scotland gave the accounts a clean bill of health.  The watchdog said the government underspend was \u0026pound339m on a \u0026pound34.5bn budget, made up of \u0026pound287m resource and \u0026pound52m capital, up from a total underspend of \u0026pound85m in 2016-17.  The main underspends were in Education and Skills  and Rural Economy .  Auditor General Caroline Gardner said improvements were needed to aid transparency, specically a new framework about financial interventions in private companies.  She said there was \u0026ldquolimited public information about the financial support to Ferguson\u0026rsquos Marine and a \u0026pound25m of loans to Fe-based manufacturer Bi-Fab.  Her report said: \"The provision of loan facilities to private sector companies highlights the Scottish Government\u0027s increasing risk appetite in providing financial support and guarantees to support policy objectives.  \u0026ldquoThere is a need for the Scottish Government to be more transparent about its overall approach in providing signicant public funds to support private companies.  \u0026ldquoWhile the business cases for loan support were clear, there is no framework in place to support the Government\u0027s decision making or approach in providing loans to private companies.  It added that by August this year, \u0026pound26m of the \u0026pound45m Ferguson loan had been drawn down.  She said: \"The Scottish Government has taken some important steps to improving its financial reporting, but there are a number of areas it can improve on to help support the Parliament and public in their scrutiny of public finances.  \"It needs to be more transparent about its overall approach to providing loans to private companies and develop a clear framework to guide its decision-making around how it invests public money.\"  Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said: \"It is completely unacceptable that the initial loan from the SNP government to Ferguson Marine only came to light as a result of Freedom of Information legislation.  \"Audit Scotland has correctly identied that the SNP government is routinely conducting its financial affairs under a shroud of secrecy.  \"The SNP government must listen to the criticisms of Audit Scotland and provide detailed information to the Scottish Parliament regarding the increasing financial risks they are taking with taxpayers\u0027 money.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \"The Auditor General is right to warn of the dangers of loans being given to private companies with no formal framework to show how ministers make their decisions.  \"There may be occasions when it is right for the Government to step in but we have to guard against support being available only to those who have the ears of ministers.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to openness and transparency for the public resources we use to support the Scottish economy and the framework for Scottish Ministers lending to businesses is already set out\u0026nbspin the Scottish Public Finance Manual.  \"As Audit Scotland recognises, the Scottish Government undertakes appropriate due diligence prior to any commitment of funds. We informed the Finance Committee of the loans to both BiFab and FMEL.  Labour MSP James Kelly said the underspend the government had been \"timid\" on stopping cuts and ending Tory austerity.  He said: \u0026ldquoIn the week where we learned that le expectancy has fallen for the first time in 35-years in Scotland \u0026ndash and crime has risen \u0026ndash the SNP should be doing everything it can to improve the lives of people in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than using the money available to them, SNP ministers have simply sat on their hands and done nothing while services suffer.  \u0026ldquoThe fact there is a \u0026pound115m underspend on education, while schools are in crisis and pupils are being failed, is simply unacceptable and will rightly anger parents.\"  Mr Rennie added: \"The Scottish Government should be squeezing their budget until the pips squeak to ensure that every penny is working for Scotland. I\u0027m particularly disappointed that at a time when hundreds of teaching posts are vacant, there is such a dramatic underspending in the education budget.\"  Public Finance Minister Kate Forbes said: \u0026ldquoFor the thirteenth consecutive year, the Scottish Government has demonstrated that we have a firm grip on public finances.  \"Under the current devolution settlement, the Scottish Government is not permitted to overspend its budget. As a consequence, we have consistently adopted a position of controlling expenditure to ensure we live within the budget caps that apply, while maximising spending on public services. Any money which is underspent in a financial year is carried forward in full into the next year and is invested in public services.\"  Ferguson Marine have been asked for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"the-scottish-community-that-built-its-own-school","story":"  It is no dferent for families in the Highland village of Strontian, on the Ardnamurchan Peninsula.  So when Highland Council suggested that, rather than refurbish the dilapidated Strontian Primary School, the 30 or so pupils would be housed in portable classrooms instead, parents decided to take matters into their own hands.  So was launched an ambitious plan to raise enough money to buy a plot of land, construct a new school building and then lease it back to the council to help pay off the debt.  Volunteers brought in \u0026pound155,000 in community shares, which unlocked other funds such as land grants and bank loans.  Now, four years after the council\u0026rsquos original plans were rejected, the brand new \u0026pound900,000 school is finally ready to open its doors.  It is a remarkable moment for members of Strontian Community School Building Ltd who have fought so hard to make their dream a reality.  Jamie McIntyre, the group\u0026rsquos treasurer, said: \u0026ldquoThe council did a statutory consultation on three possible options, but unfortunately, their preferred option was not supported by the parents, so we had a wee bit of a stalemate.  \u0026ldquoQuite casually, we asked Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, which had some land available, how much it would cost to build a new school and, when we saw the costings, we thought it was possible.  \u0026ldquoSo we put it to the council and proposed the model we have here, which is that we finance, design and build the school and we lease it back to them for use as long they need it.  Headteacher Pamela Hill, is delighted with the development, describing the 1970s building as \u0026ldquodated and sad.  She said: \u0026ldquoThere wasn\u0026rsquot much space for us. We really needed a school that was a bit more up-to-date with technology suited for children for the 21st Century as well as somewhere where there is a bit more space for them as well.  The campaign attracted admiration from local politicians. Ian Blackford MP for Ross, Skye \u0026amp Lochaber, said: \u0026ldquoAll those in the community who have made this happen should be congratulated on providing what is a first class facility.  \u0026ldquoThis shows how local people can understand how they can deliver the needs of the local community whether that is education or other vital services.  \u0026ldquoWe need to make sure we give sufficient support to communities on the ground like this and that public authorities are not putting unnecessary hurdles in their way.  Highland councillor Andrew Baxter said the work of Strontian\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquovery talented community could inspire others.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think other communities in the Highlands and across the whole of Scotland could be looking at this and saying that they too could do something like this.  The long term future of the building as a school is still a little uncertain beyond the next decade because there is a break in the lease with the council - although it could run for at least 15 years when the community debt would effectively be cleared.  At that point the council could consider moving the primary pupils into a facility on the grounds of the nearby secondary school - a move which is not possible at the moment under the terms of its PFI contract.  However, whatever the future holds for pupils attending the new Strontian Primary School the building has been specically designed with the longer term in mind.  Part of the design brief was to create a building that could be converted into four affordable homes to benefit the Strontian community further.  Mr McIntyre said the plan is an example of how a community can design services for itself in a joined up way, rather than looking at assets on an inidual basis.  But he also argues there are crucial lessons to be learned about the way communities should be encouraged and supported in development projects.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are all obviously delighted with the new school, but we have had a lot of sleepless nights.  \u0026ldquoThere were times when it seemed it just would not happen and what we want to make sure is that, when communities are working to provide facilities in this way, public bodies do their utmost to support them."},{"url":null,"title":"first-minister-backs-incredibly-valuable-herald-campaign-to-celebrate-stem-innovations","story":"  Her comments come as The Herald launches a campaign to celebrate the remarkable contribution the nation makes to global developments in Stem.

Ms Sturgeon said: \u0026ldquoI want Scotland to be the inventor and producer of the innovations that shape the future.  \u0026ldquoCampaigns like this are incredibly valuable in helping to tell the stories of how Scots have shaped the world and continue to do so.  \u0026ldquoChange and innovation are happening all around us in the workplace, the economy and our everyday lives - this is driven largely by developments in Stem.  \u0026ldquoWe know these sectors of the economy are growing quickly and it is likely that they will continue to do so and we have an opportunity to have an innovative, growing economy in Scotland.

Robert Halfon, the former Conservative Skills Minister, admitted: \u0026ldquoSerious stuff from Labour this week that may resonate with millions of workers. Conservatives need a thoughtful response to this at conference.  Writing on the ConservativeHome website, the MP for Harlow in Essex noted: \u0026ldquoDeep social and economic problems remain.

He argued that while Tories needed to be honest about the failures of capitalism, simply echoing the criticisms of the Left would drive voters away.  \"When we Conservatives veer between talking business down, ignoring voters\u0027 concerns, and telling businesses to shut up - or worse - it is a clear sign we have lost our way,\" declared the Surrey MP.  \"When it comes to our relationship with business, we must unscramble our compass  we are to stand any chance of defeating the hard left.  \"And whichever side you are on in the Brexit debate, we need to realise that  we are not the party of business, then we are nothing.\"  His comments appear in part to be aimed at Boris Johnson and other Tory Brexiteers who have responded dismissively to business warnings about the economic consequences of leaving the EU.  Mr Gyimah stressed that the party was at its best when it was \"pro-enterprise and pro-endeavour\" in a way that made clear its motive was to improve the lot of the ordinary citizen.  \"If all voters hear from us is an echo of the Left\u0027s concerns, and singing from Labour\u0027s hymn sheet, without an enthusiastic and full-throated endorsement of open markets, and without trumpeting our record, we will have only ourselves to blame when they turn away from capitalism.\"  The minister added: \"We can\u0027t out-Corbyn Corbyn, and  we try, we risk offering a pale imitation that leaves people yearning for the real thing.\"  Meanwhile in the same issue, Mr Freeman, Theresa May\u0026rsquos former policy chief, argued: \u0026ldquoWe are living though one of those moments in political history when everything changes.  \u0026ldquoThis is a 1975, 1945, 1905 moment: when the underlying rules of our system of political economy profoundly change.

It is the latest in a series of awards to the charity from the Scottish Government, dating back to 2005 after a co-operation agreement between the the two countries was signed.  In August, the Scottish Government announced that it is to provide \u0026pound11 million to support local projects in Malawi focused on health, education, economic development and renewable energy.  News of the funding boost came as Scottish International Development Minister, Ben Macpherson, was welcomed by pupils to Mpangweni Primary School in Dowa, in the central region of the African country.  Mr Macpherson said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove just seen the remarkable dference Mary\u0026rsquos Meals is making here in Malawi.  \u0026ldquoThey are feeding more than a million children thanks to contributions from across Scotland, including from the Scottish Government.

Earlier this month, the charity said it is now reaching 1,361,586 impoverished children in 17 countries.  Mary\u0026rsquos Meals was founded in 1992 by chief executive Magnus MacFarlane Barrow, with a vision that \u0026ldquoevery child receives one daily meal in their place of education and that all those who have more than they need, share with those who lack even the most basic things.  Mr MacFarlane-Barrow, who comes from Argyll, said: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos important to us is the hungry child.  \u0026ldquoWhen there are hungry children in front of us today, we\u0026rsquore going to feed them, and at the same time we\u0026rsquore going to work on the solution to getting them fed in the long term, creating a global movement of people who believe in this vision.  In Dowa, Daniel Adams, executive director of Mary\u0026rsquos Meals UK, said: \u0026ldquoIt was wonderful to see the happy, smiling children as they arrived this morning, with their mugs in hand and ready for the day\u0026rsquos learning.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted that the minister was able to join us to witness the amazing changes that are being created in the lives of so many children across Malawi and beyond.  From feeding 200 children in Malawi in 2002, Mary\u0026rsquos Meals now provides meals in school to 30 per cent of primary school aged children in the country.  And research shows that in schools where children receive Mary\u0026rsquos Meals, enrolment increases, attendance improves, drop-out rates fall, and children are happier, healthier and do better in class.

In Brussels for a meeting with the EU\u0026rsquos Michel Barnier, Jeremy Corbyn warned that a no-deal risked a \u0026ldquonational disaster and, after his talks with the Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, said: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously not negotiating.

A majority of SNP councillors banded together with some Liberal Democrat, Green, independent and Labour members to defeat the ruling Tory administration.  Now\u0026nbspthe Scottish Tories\u0026nbsphave accused the SNP of \"betrayal\" after some nationalists backed the move for a vote on the Brexit deal terms.  The symbolic council decision - the first of its kind in Scotland - puts the SNP councillors who voted in favour at odds with their party position on a \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will not stand in the way of a People\u0027s Vote but has not backed the campaign, raising concerns over the possibility of Scotland again voting to remain but the UK as a whole voting to leave.  However constitutional relations secretary Mike Russell told MSPs he has had \"very constructive\" talks with the People\u0027s Vote campaigner Hugo Dixon.  Tory MP David Duguid, who represents the Aberdeenshire constituency of Banff and Buchan, said he was \"astonished\" some SNP councillors representing fishing communities backed the People\u0027s Vote.  He said: \"The British people - including those here in Banff and Buchan - voted to leave the EU.  \"People voted to leave for a number of dferent reasons. But in coastal communities like those across Banff and Buchan, many people just wanted out of the Common Fisheries Policy.  \"Failure to respect the outcome of the vote would be an utter betrayal of our fishermen and a travesty for democracy in this country.  \"The question for Nicola Sturgeon is - does she agree with her SNP councillors in Aberdeenshire and is she also willing to disregard the views of our fishermen?\""},{"url":null,"title":"first-scots-council-endorses-peoples-vote-on-brexit","story":"  A combination of Green, SNP, LibDem and Independent councillors outnumbered the authority\u0026rsquos dominant Conservative group in a fiercely contested vote on Thursday.  The Tories accused the SNP of \u0026ldquobetraying the fishing communities of the north east, who voted heavily for Brexit in order to leave the Common Fisheries Policy.  The LibDems also said the vote was embarrassing for Nicola Sturgeon, as it showed her councillors had shown more leadership on a People\u0026rsquos Vote than she had.  Both the original Green motion and an SNP amendment included the demand for \u0026ldquoa further referendum to give the UK public the final say on any terms agreed for Brexit, that referendum to include the option of the UK remaining in the EU.  Among those SNP councillors supporting it were representatives from the coastal wards of Fraserburgh, Banff, Troup and Peterhead.  As the council has no power over another referendum, the vote was symbolic, but was still the first of its kind in Scotland and pointed to a potential sht in SNP attitudes.  Ms Sturgeon has refused to endorse a People\u0026rsquos Vote on the final Brexit deal, apparently worried about setting a precedent that could lead to re-run of a Yes vote on independence.  However with the Labour party edging toward the LibDem position of backing another referendum, the First Minister does not want to be left closer to the Tories, who oppose it.  David Duguid, the Tory MP for Banff and Buchan, said he was \u0026ldquoastonished that SNP representatives in fishing communities would try to revisit the 2016 result.  He said: \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave for a number of dferent reasons. But in coastal communities like those across Banff and Buchan, many people just wanted out of the CFP.  \u0026ldquoFailure to respect the outcome of the vote would be an utter betrayal of our fishermen and a travesty for democracy in this country.  \u0026ldquoThe question for Nicola Sturgeon is \u0026ndash does she agree with her SNP councillors in Aberdeenshire and is she also willing to disregard the views of our fishermen?  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: \u0026ldquoThis is a lightning bolt from the grassroots targeted right at the SNP and Labour leaderships.  \"The First Minister says she will not stand in the way of a People\u0027s Vote but she is having to be dragged to the table when she should be out front passionately making the case for the whole of the UK to remain in the EU. The public must be given their right to avert economic disaster with a final say on the Brexit deal.\"  Aberdeenshire SNP councillor Richard Thomson said his group had recognised the severe damage Brexit would have upon Aberdeenshire, which the Tories seemed to be ignoring.  He said: \u0026ldquoThat damage will be acutely felt by key North East industries such as our food and drink and oil and gas sectors.  \u0026ldquoWhen jobs are lost, the Tories will be to blame.  \u0026ldquoWhen exports of Scottish seafood face y delays at the border, the Tories will be to blame. And when our fishing fleet is sold out as part of a Brexit trade-off, the Tories will be to blame.  \"It is simply a fact that to protect jobs and household incomes after Brexit we must remain in the single market and customs union.  \"Meanwhile, we\u0027ll leave the Tories to act as cheerleaders for Theresa May\u0027s botched negotiations, as they ignore the will of people in Aberdeenshire and across Scotland who voted to Remain in the EU.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8747311.jpg?type=article-full","title":"commercial-focus-when-you-want-quality-and-expertise-make-sure-its-made-in-scotland","story":"  Blair and Sheridan were formed by Douglas Blair \u0026amp Roddy Sheridan back in 2012.

Shaped on the island. Crafted with love.  Essence of Harris is a family run candle and home fragrance business located in the heart of the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, created by couple Jamie McGowan, who is originally from Glasgow, and his partner Deenie MacLeod, a Hearach .    Co-founders of Essence of Harris, Jamie and Deenie started their journey into candle and home fragrance by pouring around 12 candles a day on their kitchen table for a small following of island locals. Since the beginning, they have followed the ethos of keeping the brand natural, local and affordable using their beautul island home as inspiration for their products.  They have grown their beloved craft into a bustling candle business, boosting employment within the fragile island economy on the Isle of Harris. Candles were one thing that they both immensely enjoyed having in their home yet there wasn\u0027t anyone creating the products in the Hebrides.  Inspired by the elements of the island, particularly the beaches, they started experimenting with dferent scents and candle making at home. However as the company grew, In its very first year they gained their very own production unit, allowing them to employ a great close-knit team, and supplying to a number of Scottish stockists including the departure lounge of Inverness Airport.  Indeed, with five luxurious scents each named after the stunning west Harris beaches, the \u0027Essence of Harris\u0027 brand is now stocked in over 40 retailers across Scotland with sales abroad also on the increase via sales reps.  There\u0027s a real interest in the candles and home fragrance among tourists who are blown away by the scenery on Harris and want to take a part of Harris home!  \u0026ldquoThe rugged natural beauty of the island inspires everything we do. The product packaging is striking and elemental to reflect the romance, charm and authenticity of the beautul Isle of Harris.

The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland is performing at venues across the country as part of its ‘Walking with Heroes’ centenary tour which is aiming to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.                                                    Fresh from another incredible month of spectacular performances at the world-renowned Edinburgh Tattoo, Scotland’s State Band, as it is also known, will be performing at the Beach Ballroom on Friday, September 28.                                                     Members of the band local to the area recently joined Aberdeen Provost Barney Crockett and the Poppyscotland team to spread the word about the eagerly anticipated concert.        Lord Provost Crockett said: “It is an honour to welcome the Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland to Aberdeen. “We are very fortunate that the Beach Ballroom has been chosen as one of the venues for the band to play on its seven-date centenary tour. “I would also like to take this opportunity to wish them well in meeting their fundraising targets for the very deserving Armed Forces charity Poppyscotland.”Starring in the Beach Ballroom show will be hometown heroes LCpl Mark Angus and LCpl Natalie Mair.                                                                                                         Both hail from Aberdeen originally, and the September concert will mark the first time either has performed during their military career in the Granite City.LCpl Angus, who has played the tuba in ious military bands during his 16-year Army career, said: “The last time I performed in Aberdeen was with the brass band at Cults Academy, so I’m really excited to be back home as part of the Walking with Heroes tour.”LCpl Mair added: “I’m looking forward to having my local fan club – well, my mum, sister and aunties! – coming along to show us their support. It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge. Not only is this a lasting tribute to those who fell in the First World War, but, importantly, will also allow the Poppyscotland to make a step change in the scale of support it is able to provide those in the Armed Forces community who rely on the charity’s support today.

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Friday 28 Sep 2018 6:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world. September has a high rate of babies being born.\u0026ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low.

She encouraged iniduals and existing businesses to continue the hard work with their projects as entrepreneurialism can come from unlikely sources.Cathy emphasised how the path of an entrepreneur should not be shied away from, that young people and businesses should be encouraged to grow and learn as they develop.Later in the evening, Andy Cameron MBE regaled guests with anecdotes about his le and experiences as an entertainer.Following the dinner, the chamber presented the award for Most Promising New Business 2018 to Ice and Fire Distillery.Chamber chair Stephen Sutherland said: \"This year\u0027s entrants to the new business award showed great potential and it is always heartening to see so much new talent coming through in the local business community.\"With so many great products and services on offer, we look forward to seeing how these businesses develop over this coming year and encourage those that weren\u0027t the lucky winners this time around to think about applying for next year\u0027s award.\"Out of a strong field of entrants, Ice and Fire particularly stood out to the board, with so many developments in a short space of time and a strong set of future plans for investment in the business.\"We were delighted to recognise it as this year\u0027s Most Promising New Business.\"Launched earlier this year by local entrepreneur Jacqueline Black and her family, Ice and Fire Distillery has already seen signicant success with its inaugural gin products \u0026ndash Caithness Gin and Crofter\u0027s Tears.The Ice and Fire team have a strong connection to the local area, representing generations of crofters and gamekeepers, and took the bold step to launch this new enterprise on recognising the need for their crofts to ersy in order to survive.Starting with small copper stills to aid in recipe development, the team quickly moved into small-scale production. Their efforts have already paid off, with demand for their gin exceeding all expectations.The first full-size bottles are expected to be on the market in October, and the team already have ambitious plans to expand into rum and vodka production.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, said: \"The business community of the north Highlands has once again proven its resilience and ambition in the face of continuing political and economic uncertainty.\"This year has given us much to celebrate \u0026ndash from ambitious new businesses taking their first steps to existing businesses growing and ersying into new markets.\"Not only that, we have seen some signicant opportunities for the area move forward over the past year, with work progressing on the Beatrice offshore wind farm, as well as the announcement of the UK\u0027s first vertical launch site in Sutherland.\"Our annual dinner has always aimed to celebrate the business community of the north Highlands, and 2018 has been a great year for the region.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles.

We must also ensure the service is resilient and that suitable vessels are available when necessarily refits and maintenance are taking place.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Ministers must now learn the lessons of the previous tendering process and make sure that they listen to local stakeholders and respond to the needs of our island communities.\u0026#8220This contract needs to drive service improvements and improved capacity on these leline routes. This needs to happen both in relation to freight and restoring the cuts to services on the Pentland Firth ushered in under the current contract.“It is imperative that the Pentland Firth and Aberdeen services continue to operate as one and are not ‘unbundled’. I also believe that we need to see Stromness and Scrabster as designated ports again under any future contract.”“Getting the detail right will require the minister and his officials to engage early and on an ongoing basis with the island councils, local businesses and other key stakeholders.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor.

There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media.

This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a 6km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature \u0026ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said \u0026pound500,000 in total\u0026nbsp would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat \u0026ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotFriday 28 Sep 2018 6:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgFriday 28 Sep 2018 6:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar panels was incomplete and that some \u0026ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, \u0026ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: \u0026ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar panels.Mr Black offered an apology for the audit\u0026rsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: \u0026ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and it\u0026rsquos costing us a lot of money. That can\u0026rsquot be changed unless we\u0026rsquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to \u0026ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: \u0026ldquoThe council\u0026rsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. It\u0026rsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that \u0026lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive year\u0026rsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.\u0026ldquoPerhaps I shouldn\u0026rsquot be surprised. When the council does collect information it regularly ignores it \u0026ndash all too evident in the shambles that is their public toilet closure plan. Let\u0026rsquos hope the appointment of a new chief executive will bring a renewed focus on evidencing decisions, by both collecting the appropriate evidence and acting on it.Friday 28 Sep 2018 6:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

They\u0026rsquove travelled all over Scotland to skate parks elsewhere but there\u0026rsquos never been anything closer to home in Ullapool.\"Two years ago we got a loan of portable skate park equipment owned by Highland Council. It was located on the tennis court at Lochbroom Leisure Centre and was well-used but eventually it had to move on somewhere else.\"At the start of this year, there was an announcement that there would be a local discretionary fund to bid in to.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

It is where direction is set, policy is \u0026#173formulated, and political leadership is given, based on the everyday lived experiences of people in workplaces, and communities right across the country.                It is the forum where ideas are exchanged and tested – and nowhere is that more the case than at conference fringe events, such as The World Transformed series, held in a brewery converted into a ­theatre space just a few miles from the main conference venue.            It is always a pleasure and a privilege to participate in this ­cauldron of ideas – and this week was no dferent. The fringe ­meeting was chaired by Ed Miliband and included economic thinkers ­Martin O’Neill and Grace Blakeley, and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy.             Some of the ideas were radical, like the call to revolutionise the UK banking system. Others were reconnecting with Labour’s socialistic traditions, like economic democracy and co-operative ownership, whilst yet others looked to a future built on automation, new science and reduced and shared working time. That these ideas were aired at the conference fringe was perhaps not exceptional, that they found a ready echo in platform speeches in the main conference hall was.It was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell who embraced much of this radical thinking, converting it into concrete policy proposals for an incoming Labour government. In his main address, he outlined plans to increase public ownership, including building a new frontier of worker ownership. He pledged to establish a Public and Community Ownership Unit in the Treasury. The unit will bring in external experts to advise on and implement the transfer of PFI schemes out of the private sector. That means public services will once again be owned by the public, because ­people have had enough of being ripped off by privatisation.His plans for the private sector also include action to clamp down on the industrial scale tax avoiders who are denying our hospitals, our schools and carers of the resources they need. Mobilising shareholder power to demand that companies uphold basic tax justice standards and ensuring that they meet the Fair Tax Mark standards is a central part of this approach.In a bid to rebalance power in the economy, he has outlined ­proposals to promote employee ownership in larger companies through share issues.This has some resemblance to the ideas designed by Hans Meidner in Sweden some years ago – an approach which I have championed for some time. In most European economies these ideas are mainstream – and it is a measure of how desperately our country needs real change that they are considered by some to be “left-field”.            In my main address to conference, I built on this radical thinking and applied it to Scotland, because it is clear we need Scottish solutions to Scottish problems and Scottish challenges. So, for instance, there is no Scottish Government ­industrial strategy. We need one with an enhanced role for workers and their unions in a more planned approach to the Scottish economy. Taking water back into public ownership is a pressing demand in England, but – thanks to a ­dramatic intervention by Labour in the then Strathclyde Regional Council, who famously ran a referendum to oppose water privatisation with a 71 per cent turn out and a 97 per cent rejection rate in the 1990s – we don’t need to take water into public ­ownership here. But that is not to say though that we may not need to reform the lines of its accountability and democratic oversight. One area where we ­definitely need change is on the long-standing question on the ­ownership of land. Fewer than 500 landowners own half of all private land in Scotland. To find more just land solutions means we will have to give some consideration to tax ­measures, ownership limits and residential qualications. We should certainly take the railways into public ownership, and look at the ownership and provision of bus and ferry services. With so much of our economy over dependent on overseas ownership and foreign direct investment – meaning it operates largely a branch plant – we need to look urgently at what we can do to rebalance economic ownership. One way is by taking the lead on measures like a statutory right for workers to own the company that they are employed in when it is put up for sale or facing closure. Such a boost to co-operative and employee ownership would ­relocalise ­control and lock in more local accountability.             Scotland is, after all, the birthplace of the first workers’ co-operative, in Fenwick, Ayrshire, and became the home of father of the co-operative movement, Robert Owen. Rebalancing the distribution of financial instruments like regional selective assistance to target investments by indigenous rather than overseas businesses is also the right thing to do. So the idea of a world transformed is therefore central to the mainstream thinking of the party. These policy proposals are not made in the abstract, but in the real-world context of Brexit, the May Government’s failing negotiations and the growing likelihood of a UK general election in the next few months. This week, John McDonnell said: “The greater the mess we inherit, the more radical we have to be the greater the need for change, the greater the opportunity we have to create that change, and we will.”As this week underlined, a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is up to that challenge and in Scotland the radical economic and social programme that the people need is finding new vitality and relevance.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806516.1538117697!/image/image.jpg","title":"hampden semi final decision blasted by fans and politicians","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The decision to play both Betfred Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day was described as \u0026#8220absolutely nonsensical\u0026#8221 last night as politicians joined former players in voicing safety and transport fears.                The Scottish Professional Football League  announced that Rangers would face Aberdeen at noon on Sunday, 28 October at the Glasgow stadium and Celtic would play Heart of Midlothian at 7:45pm that night.            The plan is the SPFL’s solution to a problem caused by both Glasgow clubs’ involvement in the Europa League on the previous Thursday night, which effectively ruled out the normal practice of spreading the games out over the weekend.            A full Ladbrokes Premiership fixture card in the subsequent midweek further reduced the options.Scottish Labour MSP James Kelly, who introduced a bill to scrap the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications  Act, was quick to slam the SPFL move.He said: “This is an absolutely nonsensical decision and it must be reconsidered. The idea that Hampden is equipped to cope with two 50,000 attendance games in the space of hours is bizarre. There are likely to be serious problems with transport as it takes an age to leave Hampden by public transport as it is, never mind with a hundred thousand people coming and going. Crowd safety must be paramount and the SPFL should review this with full input from the police and other bodies.”Mr Kelly’s opinion was echoed by Andrew Bowie, Scottish Conservative MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, who said the decision takes “no account whatsoever” of the fact Aberdeen fans have to get to the game and described it a “ridiculous”.He added: “A 12pm kick-off on a Sunday makes it nigh-on impossible for any Aberdeen supporters travelling by train to get to the match on time. The football authorities should give some consideration to the fans, for once. They pay hard-earned money to follow their team week in and week out. However, when it comes to showpiece events like this, they are treated as an after-thought. It is a disgrace.”            BT Murrayfield was tipped to stage one of the matches, but the league made the controversial choice to welcome four sets of fans to the national stadium on the same day following talks with the clubs and police. The SPFL stated that it was “contractually obliged to bring both semi-finals to Hampden”.SPFL secretary Iain Blair stressed he and his colleagues had to find a solution that gave Celtic and Rangers the “necessary two-day gap between competitive matches”.He said: “We’ve been working hard with police and Hampden Park on contingency planning for exactly this scenario and, together, we examined every possible permutation. The crowded fixture calendar means this is the best and most practical solution as any alternative had the knock-on effect of causing major fixture congestion, not only for Celtic and Rangers, but for several other SPFL clubs. We met with representatives of all four clubs earlier and explained that this was the only feasible outcome. The fact that both Celtic and Rangers are in Europe, and will hopefully be playing in the Europa League after the New Year, is obviously good news for Scottish football, but it does mean that our capacity for rescheduling games is signicantly curtailed. We can confirm that Police Scotland have advised the Aberdeen versus Rangers game should be played first.”Former Hearts player and BBC Scotland football pundit Allan Preston said: “We’ve got a game at quarter to eight on a Sunday night. The reaction from people I know in the game, the reaction from fans and on social media is this could potentially be one of the worst decisions that the SPFL have made. I find it ridiculous to be honest. What happens  it’s pouring with rain? What happens  the games go to extra time and penalties? How are they going to turn around the stadium – regardless there’s going to be four sets of fans in the city. It could be a volatile situation – certainly I hope not, but it could be.”            It was meanwhile announced yesterday an expert would be commissioned to review policing at football matches in Scotland. The move was confirmed at a Scottish Police Authority meeting in response to a question about a crush at Celtic Park earlier this month, but the force later said the review was not triggered by a particular incident. One supporter was taken to hospital and four were treated at the scene after the incident before an Old Firm match on 2 September.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806919.1538144394!/image/image.jpg","title":"kezia dugdale labour s decision to stop funding wings over scotland case political","story":"        Kezia Dugdale says she has questioned how anyone can trust the Labour Party after it decided to stop funding her defence in a defamation case.

Annual turnover rose to £9.9m – the highest in the port’s 40-year history, new figures have revealed.            Bosses said the strong financial position would enable the business to continue to invest in major developments, such as the new quayside and laydown space, which is in the planning stages to be built through the next couple of years.            The past year was described as an “extremely busy one” for the port, which saw it ersy from its core business of oil and gas to renewables, decommissioning and cruise.Chief executive Bob Buskie said: “At the start of 2016, with low oil and gas prices, we knew the port had to adapt to sustain our growth and help keep local people in work.“Firstly, supporting our core customers in oil and gas was a key concern. After the necessary consultation, we introduced a new pricing for statutory dues in January 2017, which meant an average 5 per cent reduction in fees for most clients, supporting them through the downturn.  “Secondly, the port had to look to the future and see what we could do to help sustain jobs and growth. This is where our ersication strategy came in, with 2017 seeing us undertake a project to introduce decommissioning to the port in an open port policy, where our supply chain could bid for work under our licences.”Cruise continued to be a success story in 2017, with the port being named as the busiest in Scotland. In another record-breaking year, the facility welcomed 93 ships and more than 150,000 passengers to the Highlands. This represented a 54 per cent increase on 2016.            The direct spend from these passengers was worth more than £15m to the local economy and provided a boost to a range of attractions.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4806879.1538141793!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotrail were not consulted over hampden semi finals decision","story":"        The SPFL\u0026#8217s decision to schedule both Betfred Cup semi-finals at Hampden on the same day will present a \u0026#8220signicant logistical challenge\u0026#8221, ScotRail have admitted.

Aberdeenshire Council is the first in Scotland to vote for holding a referendum on the final Brexit deal, including an option for the UK to remain in the EU.                A majority of SNP councillors banded together with some Liberal Democrat, Green, independent and Labour members to defeat the ruling Tory administration.            The council voted by 33 to 26 in favour of a motion by Green councillor Martin Ford to back a so-called People’s vote.            : Police ‘prepared for potential disorder’ sparked by food shortages post-BrexitNow, the Scottish Conservatives have accused the SNP of “betrayal” after some nationalists backed the move for a vote on the Brexit deal terms.The symbolic council decision - the first of its kind in Scotland - puts the SNP councillors who voted in favour at odds with their party position on a People’s vote.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she will not stand in the way of a People’s vote but has not backed the campaign, raising concerns over the possibility of Scotland again voting to remain but the UK as a whole voting to leave.However, Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs he has had “very constructive” talks with the People’s vote campaigner Hugo Dixon.            Tory MP David Duguid, who represents the Aberdeenshire constituency of Banff and Buchan, said he was “astonished” some SNP councillors representing fishing communities backed the People’s vote.He said: “The British people - including those here in Banff and Buchan - voted to leave the EU.: Joyce McMillan: Theresa May’s Minister for Food is recipe for disaster“People voted to leave for a number of dferent reasons. But in coastal communities like those across Banff and Buchan, many people just wanted out of the Common Fisheries Policy.            “Failure to respect the outcome of the vote would be an utter betrayal of our fishermen and a travesty for democracy in this country.“The question for Nicola Sturgeon is - does she agree with her SNP councillors in Aberdeenshire and is she also willing to disregard the views of our fishermen?” SNP opposition leader on Aberdeenshire Council Richard Thomson said: “The SNP moved an amendment recognising the severe damage that Brexit will have upon Aberdeenshire – something which the Tories seem to be recklessly ignoring. That damage will be acutely felt by key North East industries such as our food and drink and oil and gas sectors.“When jobs are lost, the Tories will be to blame. When exports of Scottish seafood face y delays at the border, the Tories will be to blame. \u2028“And when our fishing fleet is sold out as part of a Brexit trade-off, the Tories will be to blame.“It is simply a fact that to protect jobs and household incomes after Brexit we must remain in the single market and customs union, which is eight times bigger than the UK market alone. The SNP will continue to make that case.             “Meanwhile, we’ll leave the Tories to act as cheerleaders for Theresa May’s botched negotiations, as they ignore the will of people in Aberdeenshire and across Scotland who voted to Remain in the EU.”         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

The SNP made two newsworthy announcements yesterday \u0026#8211 the first declaring that a date for Indyref2 wouldn\u0026#8217t be announced at conference \u0026#8211 and the second that they plan a \u0026#8216day of action\u0026#8217 on the issue at the end of this month.                 Ambitious plans to contact 50,000 voters in a single Saturday on September 29 were reported in The Scotsman earlier today.            Depute Leader Keith Brown, who is no longer in the Scottish cabinet, appears to have taken on the mantle of increasing support for independence as his personal mission.             He said that the day of action is a way for the SNP to talk to the public across the country as Britain’s departure from the EU looms. Brexit is being used by pro-independence politicians to highlight their belief that Scotland is better off outwith the UK. But why now? And why this particular campaigning tactic? We look at the possible reasons for the party’s ‘day of action’. Campaigning inspirationIn terms of campaigning methods, the approach taken by Keith Brown, who as a three-term MSP and former Royal Marine knows a thing or two about strategy, is not new.             Elections and referendums have involved door-to-door campaigning ever since universal suffrage, and the SNP’s targeting system for potential supporters has long been the envy of rival political parties. : Day of action planned on IndependenceOne of the successes of the Yes campaign at the 2014 referendum, despite its ultimate failure, was ensuring that activists were well versed on the basic arguments to take to doorsteps, through training and the easy availability of resources.It might seem strange that the SNP is stepping up its campaigning with no date in sight for a second independence referendum , but the day of action is as much about fact finding as it is about changing minds.             If the SNP want to marshal arguments in favour of independence next time around, they need to speak to as many people as possible to find out what might change enough voters’ minds. Speaking to 50,000 of them and finding out their views is a decent start. Political motivationsIn political terms, the SNP’s motivations might seem obvious , but in fact there could be more to it than that. Days of action like this are a way for the party to motivate activists, and get them used to working together, especially ahead of the party’s conference which takes place next month.             : Indyref2 ‘must wait’ until after Brexit voteWith the revelation from Ian Blackford yesterday that those expecting the announcement of a date for Indyref2 soon will be disappointed, the day of action serves to reassure any members agitating for more urgency that the SNP’s raison d’etre is still a priority. Outside groups are also starting to take prominence in the independence movement, as the attendance at a ‘Hope over Fear’ rally organised by Tommy Sheridan this weekend will surely prove.A day of action could remind independence supporters  that the SNP remains the biggest and best vehicle for constitutional change, no matter how many rallies are held by outside groups. ResponseSNP politicians were quick to throw their weight behind the day of action, with politicians and party officials sharing The Scotsman story. National Executive Committee member and former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier tweeted: “On @theSNP day of action on September 29th we will speak with 50,000 voters across Scotland. #ActiveSNP”Opposition representatives were, as expected, rather less charitable, and again urged Nicola Sturgeon’s party to focus on issues at Holyrood. Alex Cole-Hamilton of the Lib Dems suggested that voters across the country would close their curtains  they saw an SNP canvasser at their door. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said that the SNP ‘might need a bit more than 50k, just to make up the ground they’ve lost’. Whatever the response, it is clear the SNP is stepping up their independence campaign just as the impact of Brexit starts to be felt.         \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in 2018, having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.\nAfter a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on 29 minutes, and never looked back.\nEvan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from 20 yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.\nGreg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.\nNewtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.\nThe second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the 90 minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.\nSeconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.\nWhen Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.\nNewtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of 48, was his first final.\nMacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.\nHe said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.\n“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”\nLovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.\n“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parry  from Gairloch, Ian MacLeod  from Inverness, and 75-year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a Lucky2Bhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.\nOn Saturday 9th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!\n“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”\nCherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.\nHaving battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”\nDespite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of Lucky2Bhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like Lucky2Bhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be here  it wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”\n\nThree days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday 12th June, 52-year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.\n“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took 40 to 50 minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”\nAfter being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.\nHaving served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”\nDuring his 13 years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”\n\n\nOn Wednesday 13th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, 76-year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.\n“John hadn’t been 100 per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was 75 — to take it easy, so we came home\u0026#8230 We went to bed about 11 o’clock.”\n“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”\nCarol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled 999 and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.\n“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about 10 years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”\nJohn was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.\n“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”\nCarol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.\n“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”\nDr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by Lucky2Bhere is “truly le-saving”.\n“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every 90 seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by 10 per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.\n\u0026#8220The approach taken by Lucky2Bhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”\nEstablished in 2007, Lucky2Bhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in 2006 but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.\nIn view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – Lucky2Bhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across the  and breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.\nLast year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all 24 primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently 115 public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than 50 across Skye.\nRoss Cowie said: “We always said at Lucky2Bhere that  we could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.\n“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\n\nLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturday  with the 2018 Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.\nThis season\u0026#8217s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on 39 points in the table \u0026#8211 as goal dference isn\u0026#8217t factored in.\nMallaig secured their place in tomorrow\u0026#8217s showdown after recording a fantastic 4-3 away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.\nKyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved 4-1 home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.\nWith the teams having scored 168 goals between them in the league this season \u0026#8211 *including 14 in their three encounters so far, Saturday\u0026#8217s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.\n\n\n\nHaving gone from 2-1 up to 3-2 down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.\n\nMallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell\u0026#8217s side.\nJust as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor\u0026#8217 side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.\n\nWith only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s men.\nRoss Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side 4-2 ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.\nWith less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise.

Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.\n\nWith Mallaig having finished the season on 39 points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher\u0026#8217s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.\nWhat followed was a fine team performance by the 2017 winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson \u0026#8211 including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half.\n\n\n \u0026#8220I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8220The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have only  one defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.\u0026#8221\nI don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig \u0026#8211 so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We\u0026#8217re still learning and hopefully improving.\u0026#8221\n\n \u0026#8220It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people\u0026#8217s expectations of you.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026nbsp\n\n \u0026#8220I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.\u0026#8221\n \u0026#8220No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.\u0026#8221\n\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212\u0026#8212-\n\n\nArticle by Adam Gordon\nAll images by Willie Urquhart.\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead Ennis\nThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday 11th, September. \nThousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. \n“Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. \n“The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €60. \nLike Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. \nIf the film ‘Black 47’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the 1790s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In 1861 the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘Kilkenny  Moderator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:\n“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” \nThe recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.\nStudents of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. \nThe book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of 1,000 rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties 1865-92’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. \nThis is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview \n Ruairí Doyle\n\n“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TD\nSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. \nHe also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. \nSpeaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.\nThe Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the 1980’s. \nThis informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, even  it were 40 or 50 years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.\nPearse, who has been a TD since 2010, talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. \nThe Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. \nHe said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,  I am in thatposition.”\nSinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.\nPearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. \nThis is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”\nHe continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €2.5 billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”\nAs Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.\nDeputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  \n“What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  \n“It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”\nTouching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the 26 Counties.\nPearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. \nHe continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  \n“And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”\nSinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. \nThis Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. \nTeachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athome  that’s what they wish.” \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046476.jpg--.jpg?1537863861000\n","title":"par ful good effort for dementia charity","story":"  \nBallymena Golf Club did par-ful well by raising \u0026pound5,130.00 at a Charity Golf Day event for Dementia NI.\n  \nThe even saw approximately 136 golfers in 34 teams take to the greens on a superb sunny day .\n  \n The overall ladies winner was Elaine Mark and the overall men’s winner was John Devlin.\n  \nBallymena Golf Club members Noel Gourley and partner Evelyn Allen gave their support leading up to and during the event, securing sponsorship, taking photographs and running a raffle at the evening prize-giving.\n  \nFionnuala Savage Income Generation Manager Dementia NI said:\n  \n“Thank you so much to everyone who supported the Ballymena Golf Club charity day and raised \u0026pound5,130.00 for support local people living with dementia. \n  \nToday, it is estimated that there are currently 20,000 people across Northern Ireland living with dementia.

McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio\u0027s 10th anniversary are  Millie Moore , Dr Riann Coulter  and Roger Wilson .\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“McWilliam’s work remains the key attraction within our artistic programme and we complement our outstanding collection of his work with at least four major modern and contemporary exhibitions every year.”\n\nOver a decade, the gallery has hosted hugely popular exhibitions from some of Europe’s most celebrated artists including William Scott, Basil Blackshaw, Rita Duffy, Margaret Clarke, Susan MacWilliam and, recently, Neil Shawcross. Local groups including Banbridge Camera Club, Banbridge Art Club and local schools and colleges have also had the opportunity to exhibit at the gallery, ensuring its popularity with local visitors and supporters.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThere also big plans ahead, with a major exhibition of Scottish art from the Fleming Wyfold Collection scheduled for summer 2019. An exciting collaboration with the British Museum is already under way too, in addition to plans for a unique exhibition of award-winning works from the internationally celebrated local contemporary painter Colin Davidson.\n\nLord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Cllr Julie Flaherty, said: “With a stunning sculpture garden and an authentic recreation of McWilliam’s studio, we’re delighted and proud to celebrate a decade of work, commitment and success and look forward to the many more great things ahead. We’d like to thank everyone for their patronage and loyalty to the gallery and look forward to seeing faces old and new in this celebratory year.”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nPresent and past serving staff at the F.E. McWilliam Gallery \u0026amp Studio at the 10th anniversary celebrations.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nOne of the gallery’s closest collaborations has been with its cross-border partner, Highlanes Gallery, Drogheda. Jointly funded through East Border Region Interreg funding, the two galleries have both become established as leading visual arts venues and are currently working on a new, joint exhibition for November 2018 which features work by top international artists from the Arts Council Collection, London and National Museums Northern Ireland.\n\nF.E. McWilliam Gallery and Studio also incorporates an award-winning restaurant – Quails Café – which adds huge weight to its appeal as a major cultural and hospitality destination which can be shared with family, friends and colleagues.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTo celebrate its 10th year, the F.E. McWilliam Studio and Gallery is presenting two very special exhibitions, both of which run until November 10.\n\nLucienne Day: Living Design Celebrating the le and work of one of most influential designers of the post-war generation, Lucienne Day, and tells the story of her thrilling design career, unfolding in a sequence of photographs drawn from the archives of the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. Curated by Professor Emma Hunt, Arts University Bournemouth and Day’s daughter Paula Day, the critically-acclaimed exhibition has attracted thousands of visitors from across the UK, featuring in Elle Decoration and the  Magazine.\n\nOpen 18 Sculpture: Showcasing the stunning 30 outdoor sculptural works by acclaimed contemporary artists including Sandra Bell, Orla de Bri, Paddy Campbell, Drydan Wilson, Helen Hanse and Anthony Scott.

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n

The UK average was 7.7.\n\nOverall Northern Ireland continued to report the highest average le satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness ratings, and the lowest anxiety ratings, when compared with the UK and the other constituent countries of the UK.\n\nCommenting on the figures, Silvia Manclossi, head of the ONS Quality of Le Team, said: \"An important part of our work is looking beyond the economic health of the country to how its people are faring and inequalities in society.\n\n\"Today, for the first time, we have identied how factors such as health, access to services, and crime levels may affect how people rate their well-being in dferent parts of the UK.

At a crucial juncture in the Brexit negotiations it is hugely important that we sustain and build further links, cooperation and engagement across all of Ireland. I have no doubt the Seanad will be keen to hear what the Mayor has to say and continue to play our part in supporting the work of councillors across the country.\n\n“The memorandum between Belfast and Dublin city councils can act as a positive catalyst for cross-border relations and delivery. Given the role of the Seanad in relation to local government it is vital we engage with councils across Ireland who are very often at the coal face of political and community le.”\n\nSeanadóir Ó Donnghaile continued: “I am delighted too that the Seanad will also hear from the Mayors of Dublin and Cork in the coming months off the back of this initiative \u0026#8211 we should build on that engagement and facilitate more.\n\n“Ard Mhéara Hargey is a proven community, political and civic leader, I look forward to welcoming her and hearing her message to the Seanad on behalf of the people of Belfast at what is a deeply uncertain period for our all-Ireland economy, our peace process and the rights, wellbeing and prosperity of all our people.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"threes a shroud resurrection a triumph","story":"\n\nIT’S\n back on stage and it is better than ever before. Written by Stephen Large and directed by the multi-talented Martin Lynch, Three’s A Shroud examines the funny side of Belfast’s undertaking business and transforms the not so funny subject of death and religious rivalry into a barrel of laughs.\nFor years, veteran undertaker Gerry McSorley  has buried only Catholics. “They bury theirs, we bury ours,” he says simply.\nMcSorley’s assistant is Poleglass lad Simon Doherty . Simon is a wannabe rapper who’s in the wrong job, because quite simply he’s disgusted at the very thought of preparing dead bodies for a funeral. The relationship between the two is fascinating and hilarious at the same time.\nAs the battle for business intensies, Simon comes up with new and inventive ways of bringing Gerry’s business into the 21st century through the use of Facebook, an app to allow clients to track their loved ones from the morgue and live-streaming funeral services. His ideas and imagination are endless.\nFuneral traditions go out the window when young Protestant undertaker Basil Gray , who is more interested in courting widowed customers, comes along after taking over his late father’s business.\nA special mention to Shaun for his acting out of famous movie scenes from ‘The Godfather’ to ‘Scarface’ whilst preparing bodies – it’s genius, and perhaps worth a play in itself.\nBasil decides to break traditions, sparking a tit-for-tat rivalry between him and McSorley. It’s at this point Gerry turns to the Belfast  and News Letter for some Protestant customers.\nA hilarious mix-up of ‘Here Lies A Soldier’ and the ‘Soldier’s Song’ at McSorley’s first attempt at a Protestant funeral spells the end of that.\nThe undertaking war then takes an unexpected twist as the rivals are caught cold by the introduction of a half-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral service, managed by young Polish woman Irena Bukowski .\n“Typical,” says Gerry McSorley, “coming over here taking our dead bodies” in one of many unforgettable lines in the comedy.\nIrena’s new funeral service proves hugely popular in an age of austerity, forcing the Catholic and Protestant undertakers to put their rivalry aside to attempt to win back their customers,  abandoning the usuns against themuns’ policy.\nAfter a high profile republican and loyalist  are killed, the three rival undertakers are forced together as one in a desperate bid to avoid the paramilitaries and, yes, death. Disaster surely beckons, or can they work together and dodge a bullet? I will say no more.\nThree’s a Shroud is full of classic lewd, crude, rude and standard yet classic ‘Norn Iron’ humour that is expertly delivered by the impressive cast.\nThe play sees the actors skilfully play multiple roles, with a special mention for McGowan, who doubles up as Gerry’s cleaner, known for her hilariously foul-mouthed banter.\nSpike, the UVF’s ‘community donations collector,  and Gusty Stitt’s son are wonderfully played also.\nThree’s A Shroud reminds us of three things: we love to be offended, le is short and we are better united than ided.\nThe play is tribute to the rise of writer Stephen Large, who has shot to fame after creating the very funny Dundonald Liberation Army  page on Facebook, gaining 30,000 followers in no time.\nAs for GBL Productions and Martin Lynch, what more can you say in praise and admiration of one of the north’s most successful playwrights?\nI can’t recommend this hilarious comedy enough.\n\n\nThree’s A Shroud is at the Waterfront Hall until October 6. Tickets are available by calling 028 9033 4455, online at www.waterfront and at the Box Office at the Ulster Hall.\n\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"\nTHE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted 6000 responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.\n\nMr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation. The campaign also took the opportunity to highlight their campaign objectives: raising awareness of the Time for Truth advice clinics across Belfast on Saturday, September 29 and working to see  institutions for dealing with the past up and running.\n\nCampaign spokesman Ciarán MacAirt said: “We were very grateful for the time that the Deputy Director of the NIO took to listen to the families of the Time for Truth campaign. After handing over 6000 responses to the legacy consultation, we discussed how we supported the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in full and the proper resourcing of the coronial inquest system and Office of Police Ombudsman.”\n\n“We also told Mr Flatt that we planned to gather even more responses before the close of the consultation on 5th of October, especially during the advice clinics we are running across Belfast on Saturday to support any citizens who wish to respond.\n\n“We were also keen to discuss how long after the consultation closes that our families will see the British state’s response to the consultation, its passing of appropriate legislation at Westminster, and the structures in place and working. Although we want to ensure that the work is done properly, unlike it was in the past, families have longer to wait for any prospect of truth and justice under the proposed mechanisms, so the proper resourcing of the legacy inquests and the Office of the Police Ombudsman could help begin the process now. Any other delay will see the families of the Time for Truth campaign take to the streets as we did in February of this year when 7000 victims and survivors, friends and supporters joined our March for Truth.” \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36596884.ece/e32d5/AUTOCROP/w140square/ks%20at%20Stormont%2002.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Primark Belfast - August 29th 2018 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, a meeting took place between business groups Belfast Chamber of Commerce, Hospitality Ulster, and Retail NI, as well as the head of the Civil Service David Sterling, permanent secretaries from the dferent Government departments, and representatives from Belfast City Council. \n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, the business groups announced the focus would be on reducing the size of the cordon before the end of October. \n\nDecision-making power on how to deal with the recovery effort lies with Primark, and the retail giant is expected to make an announcement next week. \n\nIn a joint statement, Rajesh Rana, President of Belfast Chamber, Glyn Roberts, CEO of Retail NI and Colin Neill, CEO of Hospitality Ulster said: “We welcome the investment Primark, Belfast City Council and Department for Communities have made in the City Recovery Fund and the work that BCC has done to date.\n\n“However, the priority now is to get the cordon reduced to allow pedestrian flow to resume across all the affected streets.\n\n“We, and our members of whom make up the majority of businesses in the retail core and beyond, are extremely frustrated that there is still no firm plan for doing this.\"\n\nThe business groups called for action to be taken as soon as possible to reduce the cordon, saying any delay beyond the end of October would \"seriously detrimental to the long-term viability of many businesses in city centre as this would seriously impact on the Christmas trading season\".\n\nEfforts have been made to reduce the impact on businesses of the reduced trading area, with those unable to open having their rates liability reduced to zero, and funding commitments of £1.25m from Belfast City Council and £500,000 from Primark to help the businesses affected - with this money going into the Council-managed City Recovery Fund. \n\nRegardless, those inside or near the cordon are continuing to face an uncertain financial future, with revenue in shops able to open near the cordon down as much as 85%.\n\n\n\n\nBusinesses behind Primark fire cordon in Belfast will pay no rates\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth after Belfast Primark blaze, no-go zone traders fear for survival\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Belfast  earlier this week, Michelle Chichirim - owner of Phone Boutique on the edge of the safety cordon around the gutted Primark store - said she was \"shocked and angry at how bad business is\". \n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

At the museum it took six days, a team of 10 people working eight hours a day, to reconstruct him.\"\n\nBut she stressed it was all worth it to see the look of amazement on children\u0027s faces.\n\n\"It\u0027s so exciting for them. We had some children in earlier this week to see Dippy and they had a great time,\" she added.\n\nThere were audible \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" from excited primary four and five pupils from Botanic Primary School, who got to experience a sneak preview of Dippy yesterday.\n\nEight-year-old Christopher Killen said it was the second time he was seeing Dippy, but he loved the fact it was now in Belfast.\n\n\"When I was in London when I was three I got to see him then, but it was just as exciting to see him today,\" he said.\n\nClassmate Nadia  said she had been impressed by the sheer size of the mighty prehistoric beast.\n\n\"He\u0027s the biggest dinosaur that I\u0027ve ever seen. He\u0027s gigantic,\" she added.\n\nOn hand to explain what Dippy was like when he roamed the Earth around 150 million years ago was palaeontologist Dr Susannah Maidment.\n\n\"Dippy was a plant eater and would not have been a fast runner,\" she said.\n\n\"He would have been slow and rumbling along.\"\n\nUrging people to come along and see the exhibit, Dr Maidment said that when Dippy was alive all those millenia ago he would have weighed the equivalent of 10 cars.\n\n\"I think he\u0027s amazing,\" she added.\n\n\"I remember seeing him as a child, and Dippy\u0027s a great way to get children interested in natural sciences.\"\n\nDippy the dino in numbers\n\n26m in  The equivalent to two double-decker buses\n\n292 bones make up the dinosaur replica\n\n150m years ago he roamed the Earth\n\n4m in height\n\n10 The number of cars he would have weighed\n\n50cms in  and 25cm wide His skull is tiny in comparison to his body\n\n1905 The year he first went on display in London\n\n200,000 pre-bookings received by the Ulster Museum\n\n120,000 visitors are expected to view Dippy in Belfast\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mobile phone data reveals number of irish border crossings each year","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This equates to less than 1 crossing per person each month or 0.1  trips per week.\n\nThe report shows 40% of the border crossings by NI residents went through the border at Londonderry.  \n\nThis was 34,600 crossings each weekday. Almost 20% of crossings by Northern Ireland residents went through Newry and Mourne , but only 14% of those crossings started there, with residents from other local government districts using that crossing zone as a route to the Republic.\n\nThe report shows that the majority of border crossings start and end in locations in close proximity to the border. \n\nBetween 80% and 88% of border crossings to the Republic by NI residents started in the border areas, while between 75% and 86% of all crossings by Irish residents to Northern Ireland end in border areas.\n\nSome 38% of border crossings by Northern Ireland residents on the average weekday and 26% on the average weekend day are estimated to be work-related. \n\nTherefore 62% of crossing during the week and 74% at the weekend are for social and leisure purposes. \n\nThis means that 65% of crossings over a full week are for social and leisure purposes.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more than 250 northern ireland people aged over 100 and 37000 aged","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"resident forces donohoe to defend governments housing plan","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

general election ticket in Dublin Central.\n\nMs Duffy, who recently served as campaign manager for the Together for Yes campaign, is a barrister and was added to the constituency ticket on Thursday at a meeting of Fine Gael’s executive council.\n\nWhen asked  she was comfortable joining Fine Gael given the number of members who opposed repealing the Eighth Amendment, she said that change would not come from an echo chamber.\n\n“This was the party that put in place a really successful process to have a national conversation into what was a really isive topic,” she said.\n\n“I wanted to go somewhere where I could achieve change and be effective, there’s no point me going into an echo chamber because you have to have those conversations and find a common purpose and a common ground.”\n\nThe Dublin central constituency has been highlighted as a battleground for Fine Gael with some claiming the party were “lucky” to keep the seat at the last election.\n\n“I would not be putting my name forward on the ballot  I didn’t think I could win and that we could bring in two seats,” she added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"top dup civil servant admits to hierarchy of political

There was a glamour to being junior minister.\n\n“I feel a little uncomfortable. I feel torn in the sense of having to say this in public.\n\n“A lot of people thought he was over-promoted.”\n\nHe told the inquiry he advised former First Minister Peter Robinson not to appoint Mr Bell as Enterprise Minister.\n\nHe added Mr Bell was “very loyal” to Mr Robinson and he was rewarded for this.\n\n“Mr Robinson is his own man and makes his own decisions,” Mr Johnston added.\n\nMr Johnston also said he does not believe “we would be where we are today”  Mr Bell had not been given the job at DETI.\n\nMr Johnston also revealed it took ten days for Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness to agree the joint letter about Brexit that was then sent to the UK prime minister in 2016.\n\nHe was referring to how parts of the Northern Ireland political system worked adding that he could say “a lot of things that could deflate people”.\n\n“We didn’t want the public to see the elements of the sausage machine because it wasn’t always pretty,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait wait he screamed ryanair passenger tackled to ground making late dash across tarmac at dublin airport","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They try and keep them together but it’s not always possible.\n\nThe mum of two already knew a few people who had fostered and felt she had a lot to offer.\n\n“I always wanted more children but my marriage broke up when my youngest son was five months old and I’ve never had another relationship so I knew that wasn’t going to happen for me,” she said.\n\n“I feel my boys are at the right age now.\n\n“My oldest is 14 and my younger bot is 11.\n\n“It opens up their eyes to because they can see how well off they are and that not everyone gets the good start that they got.\n\n“There are dferent types of families all over the world.\n\n“They have taken to it really well.”\n\nAfter passing the necessary checks and becoming a foster carer Karen has welcomed several babies and children into her home.\n\nShe is currently looking after a little boy who has just turned four and a 13 week old baby.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nKaren decided to take a three year career break to allow her to focus on fostering, but many people do it alongside full or part time work as well.\n\n“I’m lucky that I have a good network of family around me too and my mum is very good,” she said.\n\n“If anyone was considering fostering I would say it’s challenging but it’s very rewarding.\n\n“Since I have started so many people have said to me ‘I’ve always thought about doing that’ but it puts people off that they will have a bond and then have to hand the baby back.\n\n“But that’s part of the process. You go into it knowing that and you have to be prepared.\n\n“You just take things a day at a time like you do with your own family.\n\n“I treat my foster children like I treat my own children. Everyone gets treated the same.”\n\nFoster carers can decide whether or not to have direct contact with the parents of the children in their care.\n\nKaren says she has decided to meet the parents of the children she looks after and has found it to be a positive experience.\n\n“Any parents I have had contact with have been very good there have been no bad vibes or arguments,” she explained.\n\nMany of the children who are in foster care will go on to be adopted and Karen has already had experience of this.\n\n“I had a little baby girl before last Christmas and I took her home from the hospital.\n\n“She had been in the neo natal ward for a week because she was having problems with her suck.\n\n“She was the best wain. She was just perfect and she was adopted by a young couple who couldn’t have children and they’d already adopted her older sister.”\n\nVanessa Nelis, Fostering Recruitment Officer for the Western Trust said there are a lot of misconceptions about who can and cannot foster.\n\n“People often believe these myths. Don’t.  Foster carers come from all walks of le and we welcome enquiries irrespective of age, race, religion, language, culture gender, disability or sexual orientation – don’t rule yourself out. You may be exactly who we need!\n\nIf you are resilient, flexible and feel that you could help a child to grow and develop through your care then get in touch with Vanessa on \nT:  028 8283 5264 / 7131 4244 or email: \n\n\n\n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\nPicture: Vanessa Nelis, Fostering Recruitment Officer for the Western Trust\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys council provide free female sanitary products buildings part campaign address period poverty","story":"\nSinn Féin Councillor Sandra Duffy has welcomed the decision by Derry City and Strabane District Council to back her motion which called on the Council to become the first in the North to support the “On the Ball” campaign.\n\nThe aim of the campaign is to provide free sanitary products in as many sporting grounds and public buildings as possible to combat the ever growing issue of period poverty.\n\nAnd as an initial step that the council looks at the feasibility and implementation of providing free sanitary products in Council facilities in keeping with the “On The Ball” campaign.\n\nSpeaking after the announcement tonight Councillor Duffy said “It’s great news that the council have backed my motion and has now become the first council in the North to embrace the “On the Ball” campaign to help prevent Period Poverty.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I hope that more councils adopt my motion and support the growing efforts to eradicate Period Poverty and highlight the issue at every opportunity.\n\n“Since I embarked on highlighting the “On the Ball” campaign locally it’s amazing to see just how quickly things have moved and how much support I have received.

In Downpatrick, 335 are on the waiting list, with 227 in urgent need.\n\nLast year, a total of 95 social homes were allocated in both towns, with the Executive confirming work is currently underway to build 30 new homes in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick as part of the first phase of the redevelopment of the former Downe Hospital site.\n\nThe waiting list figures were outlined at Monday night\u0026rsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, with politicians saying they are acutely aware of the pressure on housing officials to meet increasing need.\n\nThey say they are willing to do all they can to help and hope land can be secured to build more social homes to help reduce waiting list numbers. Last year, 222 homes were allocated across the district.\n\nIt was also confirmed on Monday night that 148 people are on the waiting list for social housing accommodation in Ballynahinch, with 103 in the urgent need category.\n\nIn the Castlewellan and Drumaroad area, 158 people are seeking homes, with 117 in urgent need, while 81 people are on the list for social accommodation in Killyleagh. Just under half of the applicants are in the urgent need bracket.\n\nElsewhere, the newly published figures reveal there are 77 people on the waiting list for homes in the Crossgar and Annacloy area, with 54 in urgent need.\n\nSixty two people are on the waiting list for homes in Saintfield and Ardglass, which includes Ballyhornan and Dunsford, with the urgent need figures 43 and 45 respectively.

Single, older people and small family households comprise 85% of the waiting list and the predominance of single and small family households underlines a signicant requirement for one and two bedroom homes, said the spokeswoman.\n\nShe said at the end of March this year, there were 354 social homes being constructed on site, including 140 in Newry, 30 in Newcastle and 37 in Downpatrick.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe number of new homes under construction in Castlewellan and Crossgar are 34 and 20 respectively.\n\nThe Executive spokeswoman added: \u0026ldquoThere are a further 451 social housing units programmed to start through the Social Housing Development Programme, with 56 social homes completed during 2017/18.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ardglass coastal clean up  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA SECTION of inaccessible and rocky coastline in Ardglass was last week cleaned by volunteers with the help of local canoeists.\n\nThe clean-up \u0026mdash organised jointly by the Loch Cuain Canoe Club and the Strangford and Lecale Partnership \u0026mdash saw dozens of people show up to clean an area between the village and nearby Sheepland.\n\nCanoeists, led by local councillor Cadogan Enright, ferried the giant bags of rubbish out to waiting boats organised by the Rogers family from Portaferry who took them to Ardglass harbour.\u0026nbsp\n\nThere, they were winched up and placed in a waiting skip provided by the village\u0026rsquos harbour master, with the weekend clean-up the second such initiative to remove rubbish from inaccessible areas at the Ulster Way along the Lecale coast.\n\nLoch Cuain Canoe Club members included Joe and Gareth Fitzsimons from Ardglass, as well as Cllr Enright and his son, Cad \u0026Oacuteg, who used the occasion to highlight upcoming training courses for families wanting to get involved in canoeing locally to be held in Castleward Bay and on the Quoile River this autumn.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoAny family interested in joining in wildle or other environmental projects by canoe in the Lecale Strangford area can contact us on Facebook, said the councillor.\n\nThe weekend event attracted volunteers from the Ards peninsula as well as others from Ardglass who were joined by people from Killough, including Marty Rice and his family.\u0026nbsp\n\nThere was also a contingent from Downpatrick and Robert Hillman and Fiona Robinson from Crossgar, with the Newcastle Wild Sea Swimmers spotted collecting rubbish on shore.\n\nNewry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin thanked the volunteers for their efforts and joined them for a well earned cuppa at the harbour.\n\nCllr Enright thanked the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership\u0026rsquos Judith Caldwell for organising the day and for helping organise several other clean-ups along the Lecale Coast this year.\n\nThe coastal clean-up in Ardglass took place after 50 volunteers joined a beach clean at Tyrella the previous weekend as part of a province-wide initiative supported by volunteers and Coca-Cola employees.\n\nThe Big Beach Clean initiative involved a number of beaches including Tyrella, with Jodie McAneaney, the \u0026lsquoLive Here Love Here\u0026rsquo manager at Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, thanking all those who took part.\n\nShe said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos important we educate people on protecting our marine le and our coastline it\u0026rsquos such a crucial part of our environment and also our heritage in Northern Ireland.

These articles are presently being manufactured by a workforce of seven, but  the proposed scheme swings into action a whole new range of items can be produced.\n\nAt the beginning of the year Mr Wilkin set about finding out just what local talent could produce and thus a new local industry was born in a small workshop behind the Ballynahinch shop.\n\nWhile Mr Billy Burrowes, one of the first employees of Pinewick and now a director, was trained as a joiner, the rest of the workers picked up the craft remarkably quickly.

But it has been in Japan that Rosetta Stone have really shot to stardom.\n\nThis was one of the first countries which the band visited after its formation and it became clear from the start that the young Irish lads obviously had something which appealed to Japanese girls.\n\nAt the end of their first Japanese tour each member of the group received a gold disc for mass sales of their LP, Rock Pictures, and their first two singles also thundering into the Japanese charts.\n\nNow they have gone and taken Japan by storm again where they are playing to crowds of between 11,000 and 15,000 twice a day.\n\nKILCLIEF \u0026mdash Strangford police have appealed to the public to help them trace keys which were stolen from a car on Saturday.\n\nThe car, a Chrysler Hillman Minx, had been parked in a field at Kilclief between 1.30 and 2pm while\u0026nbsp Mr John McMullan, of Drumroe Road, was working.

Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.\n\nAs the leboat made her  journey to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.\n\nThe  to Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.\u0026nbsp\n\nSenior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.\u0026nbsp\n\nDuring the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland  presented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.\n\nLocal authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent platform to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.\n\nIn addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.\n\nSince March last year, the local authority\u0026rsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.\u0026nbsp\n\nGeoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.\n\nSecuring the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos tourism strategy.\n\nThe current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.\n\nThe local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.\u0026nbsp\n\nOfficials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the area\u0026rsquos signicant geological and other heritage.\n\nThere are currently 127 geoparks found in 35 countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.\n\nHowever, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurther information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8709537.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"\n\n  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper \nStratton\n  \n    THE.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

Sir Patrick Coghlin after the Spad defended not telling the BBC the full truth of what he knew about RHI.\n\n                \nIn late 2016, the Nolan Show had asked him: “Did you or any member of your family benefit from the RHI scheme?”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone in front of the RHI Inquiry yesterday\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHis answer said that he had personally benefited from the scheme – but left out that his brother and his parents-in-law were also claimants.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone defended not answering that question fully, saying: “I didn’t feel I had to get into that [or] I was under any obligation to get into that.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe BBC also asked about a meeting between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell which Mr Brimstone says he recalls as “angry”, but he thought it had not been about RHI.\n\nThe BBC asked him: “Did you witness a heated exchange between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell in which Arlene Foster ordered Jonathan Bell in a highly agitated manner to keep the RHI scheme open in January 2015 [actually 2016]?\n\nMr Brimstone responded to that: “No. I did not witness any such exchange between Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell.”\n\nCounsel to the inquiry Joseph Aiken asked him: “Now, is that answer accurate to the extent that you’re saying the heated exchange was not about RHI, but you’re not acknowledging ‘well, there was a heated exchange – it just wasn’t about RHI’. Do you understand the impression that might convey is simply ‘there’s no heated exchange’?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “To be honest, I was asked a question and I answered the question...the context of that question was ‘in which Arlene Foster in a highly agitated manner ordered Jonathan Bell to keep the RHI scheme open’.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin asked: “Were you in any way prevented from saying ‘I was present during a heated exchange, but the subject matter of that exchange was not RHI it was Bombardier and Canada?’”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “No, I wasn’t prevented from saying that.”\n\nSir Patrick said sternly: “That, according to you, is an accurate... account. Now were you in some way being inhibited because you were being talked to by the BBC? If you weren’t, why not give the full account?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone said: “I didn’t think that they needed to know about any other matters that were being discussed at that meeting. The question was specic to the RHI scheme.”\n\nSir Patrick said the answer “could be seen as highly misleading,  what you say now is true”. He added: “You know the importance of being accurate. Why not answer that question accurately?”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “Forgive me, chair, but I do believe I answered it accurately.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “For myself, I find great dficulty in understanding why  you’re asked a question that is a very important question you don’t answer it properly. You say you did answer it properly.”\n\nMr Brimstone said he did not want to volunteer the full story in case it led to follow-up questions.\n\n                            \n            \n

\u0026#8220didn\u0026#8217t seem odd\u0026#8221 to him that he could use a boiler in an outbuilding to claim a lucrative non-domestic RHI subsidy, even though the boiler was overwhelmingly used to heat his home.\n\n                \nOn a second day of evidence at the RHI Inquiry, Stephen Brimstone frequently looked uncomfortable as he explained his involvement with the scheme, even though the inquiry has already said his use of the boiler is consistent with normal use rather than wasteful practice.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone pictured before the inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe veteran DUP Spad defended what he had done and insisted that he had acted properly – with the exception of failing to formally declare an interest when the issue was being discussed in Stormont.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe inquiry heard how there were two complaints – one in May 2016 and another in October of that year – which alleged Mr Brimstone was fraudulently heating his house on the non-domestic RHI scheme on the premise that he had an agricultural shed. The first complaint said: “The shed is no more agricultural than he is”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe initial inspection by Ofgem, which runs the scheme, raised a series of concerns, with the inspector suspicious about what was going on after he found children’s toys, a pile of wood for the indoor fire, a tractor and work tables in the ‘agricultural shed’, which seemed more like a big garage.\n\nHowever, after a protracted investigation during which his payments were stopped Ofgem ultimately concluded that Mr Brimstone’s shed was able to be classied as agricultural and he was properly on the scheme.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Brimstone, left, pictured before the inquiry\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nInquiry barrister Joseph Aiken said that Ofgem’s explanation for why it was possible for Mr Brimstone to legally be on the scheme raised other questions about the scheme.\n\nHe said that the logic of Ofgem’s interpretation of the rules was such that  someone were to ask a farmer to bring their sheep into their shed for one day a year and for the rest of the year there was no agricultural activity in the building it would be possible to use the non-domestic RHI scheme to put a boiler in the shed, run a pipe to the nearby house, and heat the home year-round.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut despite the authorities saying it was technically possible to do what Mr Brimstone did , he faced robust questioning over his decision to use the non-domestic scheme.\n\nDame Una O’Brien put it to Mr Brimstone “the clue is in the name – it’s a non-domestic Renewable Heat Incentive scheme”.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nStephen Nolan\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nShe asked him: “When it became apparent to you that it was possible to do this – you know, admittedly, within the rules – did it never occur to you to say ‘Hmm, I wonder  this was really ever intended? Is this right? Should I raise this with Dr Crawford? Should I raise this with the department, and really point out to them that there’s a whole group of potential applicants that don’t appear to be non-domestic who could get into this scheme?’\n\n“Did it occur to you to say ‘This is a bit odd’?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Brimstone paused before saying: “It didn’t, and probably my understanding of the scheme – limited as it was, because obviously I had looked into aspects of the scheme – but my understanding of the scheme was that up until July 2015, mid-July 2015, I wasn’t aware that there was a dferentiation for example on the tarf between the GB scheme and the Northern Ireland scheme.”\n\nDame Una said: “But you were aware that a domestic scheme had been launched in Northern Ireland, so there was a non-domestic scheme and then a domestic scheme was launched.”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “Yes.”\n\nDame Una put it to him: “And you knew that the domestic scheme of that title offered a less generous incentive.”\n\nThe former Spad said: “Yes.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDame Una continued: “You were very close to the centre of government. You were in a position where you could potentially have pointed this out more explicitly, given that you’d done the research and got to the nub of it really.”\n\nAfter a long pause, Mr Brimstone said: “The intent behind the scheme, from my understanding, was that Europe had placed particular targets on the UK Government to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions and my understanding was that this scheme was a way to encourage people to...move away from traditional fossil fuels to biomass and other technologies, renewable technologies.\n\n“So yes, maybe I should have – but my understanding at that point was literally that this was a good scheme to really encourage people to move away, whatever the situation was. \n\n“And yes, they did introduce a domestic scheme. But my view was that was to allow a scheme for homes and towns and cities and the countryside to also avail of this scheme to reduce their CO2 emissions.”\n\nHighlighting that Mr Brimstone was primarily heating a domestic property under the non-domestic scheme, Dr Keith MacLean said: “That was primarily what you were doing.”\n\nThe former Spad said: “Yeah. Yeah, exactly.”\n\nHe went on to add both schemes had “the same purpose” but that he could not heat his shed, as well as his house, on the domestic scheme.\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin said that he could have “gone back to your electric heater – which you had done for some years”, prompting a smile from Mr Brimstone.\n\nMr Brimstone said that when Arlene Foster became First Minister he had informed her he had applied to the scheme. He said that he had done so when she was appointed First Minister in January 2016 and she appointed him as one of her Spads.\n\nWhen asked how Mrs Foster had reacted to the news, he said: “I suppose she just thanked me for telling her. I think she asked ‘are you happy that everything’s OK with it?’ and I would have said ‘yes, my belief is that everything’s OK with the application’ and that was the end of the matter.”\n\nWhen asked  it was discussed that the declaration of interest should be formalised by putting it in writing, he said: “No. That wasn’t the way it would have worked. You would have had conversations amongst each other.\n\n“Other than a letter of resignation or a letter of appointment – that was [sic] the sorts of things you put in writing to each other.”\n\nAlluding to the dearth of documentary evidence about key elements of the RHI timeline, barrister Joseph Aiken said sardonically: “I think the inquiry has worked that out.”\n\nSir Patrick Coghlin said: “In some ways, someone could form an even more serious view... you tell the first minister you have an interest, and having done that you then continue to be involved. And that can play back on the genuineness of your declaration - you’re just doing it for form.\n\n“You may shake your head and so on, but that is the sort of perspective somebody might adopt. That’s why it’s so important.”\n\nMr Brimstone said: “I appreciate that, chair...I should have stepped back from every instance [of RHI discussion in government], and yes every instance makes the thing even worse.”\n\nThe inquiry’s technical assessor, Keith MacLean, said: “It sounds that it goes beyond your judgement as well - you’ve told Mrs Foster, you’ve told Mr Johnston and none of the three of you have come to a conclusion or had a discussion about the need to do something formally and for you to withdraw.”\n\nSir Patrick said that “the other dficulty” is that all of this was happening at the very top of government, among three people in the first minister’s office.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

report which first exposed the scale of the RHI overspend, Mr Johnston urgently sought from the then-minister responsible for the scheme, Simon Hamilton, and his Spad, John Robinson, “all submissions that were put to Arlene on the RHI scheme by DETI [her old department]”.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nHe went on to say that “we need this material discreetly today and when asking for it do so by phone call and not email”.\n\nThe inquiry asked Mr Johnston in writing why he had done so.\n\nHe said: “I wanted all relevant documents to try to establish what material had been submitted to the First Minister  to provide an accurate record so that any comments and statements that were publicly issued in the aftermath of the NI Audit Office Report were in fact accurate. I recall this being part of a fact checking exercise of which the FM would have been aware.”\n\nThe inquiry asked Mr Johnston why he wanted the matter dealt with in a way that would not leave a trail.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe said: “I wanted the matter treated ‘discreetly’ because at that point I did not want it to become clear that we really were not aware of what were the facts during the period in question. I did not want it becoming clear that we had commenced a process of fact checking.”\n\nWhen asked why he used party email accounts – rather than official government email addresses – for the communication, Mr Johnston said: “This was my practice for all of my period as a special advisor as I did not have access to official documents outside of office hours and I never adopted the procedure of using two phones. My department and ministers all knew that had always been the case.”\n\nPressed by the inquiry on why Spads and ministers “engaged in behaviour that was designed to avoid the creation of written records of their actions and what the reasons for such behaviour were”, Mr Johnston denied that there was “a general practice of behaving in a way of avoiding written records”.\n\nHowever, he accepted that there were “many occasions when discussions between minister and advisors would not have been recorded”, adding that “the vast bulk of meetings between the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on how to resolve dficult political issues within government were rarely documented”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe said that “Sinn Fein in particular were keen to exclude officials from meetings. Sometimes that was appropriate but on many other occasions it was not”.\n\nThere is also evidence which backs up allegations that Mr Johnston had a senior role among Spads and acted as an ‘enforcer’.\n\nA message released by the inquiry shows that the Executive’s top spin doctor, David Gordon, sent an email in which he advised that a query from the BBC about the RHI scheme should be responded to with “a shorter statement, plus a scary TJ [Timothy Johnston] call to Nolan might be in order”. When asked what precisely was meant by “a scary TJ call to Nolan”, Mr Johnston simply said: “A call that would set out the FM and DUP version of events up to that point.”\n\nMr Johnston said it was “not unusual” for the DUP and Sinn Fein to deliberately keep issues from being discussed at the Executive to keep them away from the smaller parties.\n\n                            \n            \n
