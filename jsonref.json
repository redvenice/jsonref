Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet!

a replica of the pictures from their engagement shoot           The Duchess of Sussex giggled as her husband had his beard stroked by a youngster in Croke Park stadium  Meghan met three-year-old Walter Cullen, who playfully tugged at her hair while she was turned the other way          Nonplussed by  her status, three-year-old Walter giggled after he pulled at the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s hair          Little Walter Cullen tried to hide behind his hands as he was gently told not to pull Meghan\u0027s hair           Later in the day, Harry and Meghan paid a visit to Dogpatch Labs, which is one of Europe\u0027s leading startup hubs           During the visit, the royal couple were treated to a \u0027tech display\u0027 by children taking part in an initiative called CodaDojo           Meghan looked animated as she and Harry spoke to children during their tour of the DogPatch Labs in Dublin today           The pair looked fascinated as the young people involved explained the work they do as part of the programme           Harry and Meghan looked relaxed as they conducted a busy day of engagements, including a tour of the DogPatch Labs          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took part in a round table discussion during the visit to the leading start-up hub          Harry and Meghan were greeted by crowds of well-wishers as they conducted their second day of engagements today           Harry happily let a cheeky youngster play with his beard during his walkabout of the Croke Park stadium            Prince Harry was gifted a Hurley and Sliotar by one adorable youngster at Croke Park stadium    The Duke and Duchess headed onto the pitch where they watched traditional Gaelic sports being played          Harry opted for a slightly more dressed-down look at the stadium, wearing a light grey blazer, simple white shirt and blue desert boots          Prince Harry was animated as he chatted with two young players at the stadium, who giggled away at his antics          Harry and Meghan were relaxed as they chatted with players taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          The couple had the opportunity to talk to players, many of whom are involved with community outreach projects that encourage the use of sports for social goodThe couple walked around the frighteningly realistic bronze statues with their sculptor, Rowan Gillespie, and Mike Murphy, editor of The Famine Atlas, who talked them through some of the stark realities of the tragedy for the people of his country.Mr Murphy said afterwards that the couple clearly had some understanding of the famine and what it meant to the people of Ireland but had been genuinely shocked at what they learnt.\u0027In fairness they definitely had a background understanding but were shocked to hear the nitty gritty,\u0027 he said.\u0027Harry mentioned several times at how appalling it was that we don\u0027t seem to have learnt the lessons of the past and we are still seeing famine and food shortages around the world today. \u0027 Sculptor Mr Gillespie added: \u0027This is a living monument and they were genuinely and powerfully moved by what they saw. They were very conscious that this isn\u0027t just about history, that this thing is still going on around us today and it\u0027s relevant to what we do today. The couple both managed to make a speedy change of clothes before arriving at Croke Park museum\u0027Every inidual is moved by what they see, which is incredibly rewarding. It is an incredibly important story between Britain and Ireland.\u0027They were profoundly moved to see the memorial and hear the story behind it. It is part of our joint histories.\u0027Meghan was very strong on the link with the city of Toronto where she lived and Harry spent a lot of time. The city only had 18,000 inhabitants but as those ships came across in their droves, Toronto took in 38,000 disease-ridden, starving famine victims. In the stadium museum the couple saw replica jerseys used in the film Michael Collins, which depicted the shooting, as well as the whistle used by the referee that day and a match ticket.They also saw club records featuring Collins, a key figure in the Irish independence movement, from when he was secretary of the Geraldines GAA club in London between 1909 and 1915. It was the IRA operation led by Collins to kill 14 undercover British intelligence agents operating in Dublin - known as the Cairo Gang - that led to the security forces opening fire on the crowd at Croke Park.Out on the pitch they watched as groups of boys and girls played hurling, camogie - the women\u0027s equivalent - Gaelic football and \u0027fun and run\u0027, a rounders-like game designed to be inclusive for people with disabilities. As the couple met Joe Canning, the Galway player who is regarded as one of the modern greats of hurling and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland, Harry told him: \u0027Apparently you\u0027re like a god.\u0027Harry also met a red-headed boy in wheelchair, Nathan Kiely, seven, and told him how impressed he was with his freckles. Jennifer Lawless, 22, an intern from North Carolina, said: \u0027He said, \u0027You have more freckles than I have. Lovely freckles!\u0027Although the couple were both given hurleys - the curved stick used to hit the ball, or sliotar, in hurling - the duke passed up on the opportunity of having a go himself.It is, however, very difficult: even Joe Canning missed his first shot at goal when he was showing the couple how it was done by the experts. \u0027The first one was a disaster,\u0027 he said. \u0027I had to redeem myself with the second one.\u0027He added about the duke not having a go: \u0027He didn\u0027t want to do it. I was thinking he might, but he will stick to the soccer later on, I think.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a youngster taking part in a Gaelic games demonstration          Undeterred by the drizzle, the Duchess of Sussex even braved the grassy pitch in her stiletto heels  In 2011, Harry\u0027s grandparents The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the arena, as part of their historic state visit to IrelandAs the couple walked round the hallowed turf, Meghan in her high heels, one onlooker said: \u0027I would guess that that is the first time a pair of stilettos has been seen on the pitch.\u0027Chatting to youngsters from the hurling pitch, Harry picked up the hurley and said: \u0027That\u0027s really light, isn\u0027t it?\u0027Picking up a goalie\u0027s helmet, Harry asked Tom Whooley, nine, if he had ever been hit in the face by a ball. When he answered no, the duke asked him: \u0027Have you hit a ball into someone else\u0027s face? Not yet? Working on it!\u0027 \u0027Meghan was very well informed about this link and Harry knew a great deal too. They were very conscious of this.\u0027While the couple were viewing the memorial there a handful of cat calls from across the river.          Harry follows in the footsteps of  the Queen the Duke of Edinburgh who visited Ireland\u0027s largest and most iconic sporting arena, as part of their historic state visit to Ireland in 2011          The stadium is the venue for the highest profile events on the Irish sporting calendarOne man and a woman could be heard shouting Sinn Fein slogans and another lone man shouted a crude remark at the duchess. Neither appear to have heard it, however, said Mr Gillespie.The pair also met excitable fans - one of whom said Meghan had \u0027made her life\u0027. Dylan Mahon, who is from Grange Rath, Co Meath, is a member of St Colmcille\u0027s GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) club who met Harry at Croke Park.Afterwards Harry told him: \u0027You might have a beard soon - you never know!\u0027The visit to Croke Park was a chance for the couple to see children being coached in traditional Irish games. But it was also an opportunity for the duke and duchess, who are on the second day of their tour of Ireland, to see mementos of one of the most notorious days in Anglo-Irish history.On November 21, 1920, British forces opened fire at a Gaelic football match between Tipperary and Dublin, killing 14 spectators and players including the Tipperary captain Michael Hogan.The day, which became known as the original Bloody Sunday, has become enshrined in Irish folklore. But while the atrocity has lost none of its capacity to appal, a historic gesture of peace and forgiveness was made in 2011 when the Queen became the first monarch to be welcomed at Croke Park since the shooting.Now it is firmly on the itinerary for visiting members of the royal family.          At one point, Meghan urged Harry to have a go at hurling, but he politely declined to get involved     The couple chatted with the players who are involved with community outreach projects          Harry gave his wife a stern look as they held hands during their tour around the historic grounds          Croke Park is the headquarters of, the GAA. Prior to the Association buying the stadium in 1913, the grounds were privately owned    The couple were taken on a tour of the stadium\u0027s museum before going on to the pitch for a sports demonstration          The pair were pictured chatting and joking with young gaelic footballers at Croke Park           The Duke and Duchess heard about the important role that GAA plays in Irish life during their trip           The pair, accompanied by a security detail, strolled around the grounds of Croke Park           Meghan\u0027s second and final day in Dublin got off to a busy start performing two engagements before lunch time - and her wardrobe was equally busy          The Duchess of Sussex wore two outfits in the space of an hour and a half, in the form of an estimated total of £17,04 worth of designer labels  Meghan, 36, was pictured in a trouser suit for the first time since her wedding having last worn one to an awards event back in February             The couple looked delighted as they made their way out onto the pitch, despite the dismal weather           The pair were also shown exhibits from Croke Park\u0027s museum, including artefacts from the Bloody Sunday massacre          Meghan, 36, who brought one of her dogs to London when she relocated, looked delighted to meet the president\u0027s pets  As ever, Meghan looked ine in black velvet court shoes and a taupe green dress by designer Roland Mouret    The Duke and Duchess met with the President Michael Higgins at Aras an Uachtarain this morning          The Duchess of Sussex was snapped gazing adoringly at her husband Prince Harry as they attended a formal reception          The pair then made their way to Croke Park museum, home of Ireland\u0027s largest sporting organisation, the Gaelic Athletic Association  Meghan is a known friend of Mouret\u0027s with French designer Roland Mouret making appearances on her now deleted Instagram account so it came as no surprise to see her her opt for one of his pieces today          The Duchess of Sussex looked ready for business in the taupe dress and Fendi handbag - one of her most professional looks          The Duchess giggled as she stroked the large dog - and the pampered pooch looked just as pleased to meet the royal visitor      The Duchess of Sussex looked confident in her role as she smiled for the cameras at the official photo call          The Irish president and his wife looked delighted to meet the newlyweds on the second day of their visit          The Duchess of Sussex was the picture of polished perfection in the grey dress, black bag and black heels          Ireland\u0027s President Michael Higgins embraced the Duchess of Sussex while his wife, a former actress, giggled at a joke she made           Meghan put a hand on Sabina Higgins\u0027 back as they made their way back down to the steps to continue their day of engagements           The President and his wife cheerily waved from the steps of Aras an Uactharain as Meghan and Harry made their way to their car and on to their next engagement           Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex signed only with their first names in a visitor\u0027s book during the Presidential meetingIn a hurry, Meghan?

One containing the opening words of St Matthew\u0027s Gospel \u0027Book of Generation\u0027 and the other St Mark.The book comprises 650 pages on high quality calf velum.

Humphrys got more than £600,000 in last year\u0027s figures, but the BBC says t his salary will drop below £300,000    The pay of household name stars including Tess Daly is not knownBBC stars paid by BBC Studios, a TV production and distribution company, do not have to have their salaries disclosed. The company makes many of the BBC\u0027s popular programmes, but has been a commercial entity since April 2017 and is not funded by licence fee payers. Stars of programmes including Top Gear, Strictly Come Dancing, Planet Earth II, Doctor Who, Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys, EastEnders, Casualty and The One Show - all created by BBC Studios - are off the list, or have just portions of their salaries shown.For example, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman was last year in the £450,000 - £499,999 pay bracket, but in the 2018 report, she is in a £370,000 - £379,000 pay bracket for hosting a weekly show on Radio 2 and a \u0027range of programmes and series\u0027 on BBC.Her fee for hosting Strictly now does not appear.Casualty actor Derek Thompson, EastEnders star Danny Dyer and Strictly Come Dancing judge Dame Darcey Bussell are among those who were featured on last year\u0027s list, but have now dropped out.Some of the stars no longer the list: Zoe Ball, who made up to £300,000 in the last pay list, does not appear as  Strictly: It Takes Two is made by BBC StudiosMatt Baker and Alex Jones are also no longer on the list because The One Show is made by BBC Studios                                                       BBC accused of using \u0027smoke and mirrors\u0027 to mask how much rich-list stars are paidThe BBC agreed with the Government to publish its top salaries annually. But it includes stars only paid directly by the licence fee.This means a string of major celebrities, who are paid directly by production companies or the BBC\u0027s commercial arm, can be left out. It is thought a third of the stars who appeared last year may be absent this time.BBC Studios was created to let the corporation sell shows to rival broadcasters and compete with giants such as Netflix. It creates the likes of DIY SOS, The One Show and Strictly Come Dancing.

Mr Anderson said the so-called positive pressure ing masks used by the boys were ‘crucial’.Their use meant that even if a boy panicked during the rescue and got water inside his mask, the pressure would expel it.

That is why he has long been so hostile to Britain, which has shown far too great a spirit of independence.Affronted by Brexit, he\u0027s a key architect of the EU\u0027s punishment strategy, compromising a refusal to negotiate constructively on one hand and, on the other, an extortionate demand for a so-called \u0027orce\u0027 settlement.His attitude makes it believable that he was behind the damaging leak about the MayJuncker dinner.Selmayr angrily denied he was behind this character assassination.Yet it seems to fit his anti-British agenda, as well as his record as an intriguer and manipulator.It\u0027s not the first time he\u0027s been accused of leaking to the press to undermine the British side in Brexit negotiations. Selmayr\u0027s attitude may have been triggered by an incident in his youth, when he was briefly a student in London.One evening in 1993, he went to hear Margaret Thatcher speak at an event to promote her memoirs. Although he bought a signed copy, he was appalled to hear her attack the dream of European integration. He came away with a sense that \u0027there is a big misunderstanding between Britain and the EU\u0027.           Juncker, never one distinguished by his own work-rate, calls his Chief of Staff, only half-jokingly, \u0027the Monster\u0027Contemptuous of national borders, laws, self-governance and identity, Selmayr is the classic European ideologue bent. Like one of Robespierre\u0027s unyielding revolutionaries during his French Reign of Terror, he is a political zealot, renowned for his dedication and brutality.Juncker, never one distinguished by his own work-rate, calls him, only half-jokingly, \u0027the Monster\u0027.His commitment is matched by his merciless intimidation which has created its own reign of fear in Brussels.He thrives on such a reputation, boasting that he keeps the Commission and its 35,000 staff under control. As for his Rasputin nickname, he says: \u0027If it means there is an efficient manager, somebody who is not a wimp, I\u0027m OK with that.\u0027 Others are not so happy.In 2016, Kristalina Georgieva, the EU\u0027s Budget Commissioner from Bulgaria, cited the \u0027poisonous\u0027 atmosphere that Selmayr created.A central part of the problem is Selmayr – a lawyer by training – often acts like the Commission President himself. One spoof Twitter account joked that Selmayr is now the \u0027Chef de drinks cabinet\u0027 for Juncker, but that is a gross misreading of the real situation. With typical ambition, Selmayr has exploited his boss\u0027s absences to acquire more political authority than any official in EU history. This, in turn, feeds his epic self-importance.                             Do you know the difference between Selmayr and God? God knows that he\u0027s not Selmayr                        German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble \u0027Do you know the difference between Selmayr and God?\u0027 the long-serving German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble once said. \u0027God knows that he\u0027s not Selmayr.\u0027That spectacular egotism often comes across as political thuggery.As with so many authoritarians, Selmayr seems to believe that the end justifies the means. In his case, the end is the creation of a united, federal Europe. He claims his belief in this vision was fired as a schoolboy, when his maternal grandfather Heinz Gaedecke took him to the First World War battlefields and military cemeteries of the western front, including those at Verdun.The lesson that young Selmayr absorbed from this trip was that Europe must unify to avoid the blood-soaked lessons of the past.But Selmayr also had a direct family connection to the darkest episode in Germany\u0027s history. During the Second World War his grandfather was a Lieutenant Colonel on the Wehrmacht\u0027s staff in the Balkans where he won three bravery awards – including the Iron Cross, first and second class.After the Allies\u0027 victory, Josef Selmayr was tried by a British military tribunal for war crimes, found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He served only five years, and on his release helped to create West German military intelligence.           Martin Selmayr (pictured second right) enjoys a drink during Oktoberfest in BrusselsThis painful family experience gives Selmayr another link with Juncker, whose father was conscripted into the Wehrmacht.But Martin\u0027s own upbringing was far less clouded by conflict. He has been accused of \u0027bossy, whip-smart legalism\u0027 – his lawyer father was an adviser to the office of the German President. Selmayr joined the EU\u0027s bureaucracy in 2004 at the age of 34.Ferociously ambitious, Selmayr spotted the potential of working for Juncker, whose spongy, erratic character was part of his appeal, as it gave far more scope for his chief of staff to have influence. Juncker duly became EU President in 2014, despite a strong campaign against his candidacy by David Cameron. His henchman Selmayr has been thwarting Britain ever since. He wants victory for the EU and humiliation for us.He was one of the diehard opponents of any concessions being granted to Cameron last year during negotiations for a new British relationship. He is just as uncompromising today over Brexit. But our Government cannot give in to this Teutonic oppression. Martin Selmayr\u0027s undemocratic antics must not be allowed to deny us our freedom and sovereignty."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/15/4E1F09D500000578-0-image-a-79_1531318208892.jpg","title":"Mobile phone lost 100ft underwater diver lit receiving text","story":"Result!

At the time they were aged just nine, six and four          The family decided to undertake their voyage in 2002 after the birth of Marien and the death of Jamie\u0027s mother coincided. It took them six years to prepare for the trip\u0027We had high-paying jobs, dual income. It was so perfect and white picket fence it was almost painful. It makes your teeth hurt.\u0027Then in a two week spell in 2002, our eldest daughter was born and my husband\u0027s mother passed away. It was hard to see those milestones of life happening together.\u0027My mother-in-law was going to go traveling but she had cancer and literally died within weeks.\u0027It forced us to think about our priorities and what we wanted, and when Jamie and I met this was something we were always going to do.\u0027We had been telling people we were going to take our children on a boat and sail and we didn\u0027t know when we would be coming back, and we got some looks like, You\u0027re crazy.\u0027When we left in 2005, we felt exhilarated and euphoric. I couldn\u0027t believe it. It was something we had worked so long and hard for.\u0027It\u0027s such a crazy, different way of life from the outside. On one hand, we have given up so much to do this but we have zero regrets.\u0027We barely saw each other before and now our family is very tight. We have had the most wonderful opportunity to experience the world with our kids.\u0027While there is no typical day aboard Totem, the Giffords wake up when the sun rises and sleep when it sets, bedding down in one of two cabins on their floating home.Behan and Jamie also homeschool their children, teaching them standard subjects as well as devoting time to cultural immersion and hands-on learning.The kids don\u0027t have mobile phones so there\u0027s no Snapchat or Instagram and they\u0027re \u0027not dialed in to popular culture\u0027, but they spend time relaxing or exploring.They also chip in with chores, including doing laundry without a washing machine, helping maintain the boat and preparing meals.They eat local wherever possible - rice dishes in Mexico roshi flatbreads in the Males - and stock up on vegetables and pasta at markets as well as catching fish.\u0027Before I went cruising, we could load up the minivan with a half dozen bags of groceries and walk them up to the double fridge,\u0027 Behan said.\u0027Now everything I\u0027m finding at markets and carrying it back, but I can only carry so much at a time.

The family carry few supplies on the boat, instead relying on markets and restaurants in each country          Behan blogs about the family\u0027s experience on board the boat, and says she does not plan to give up the dream lifestyle any time soon\u0027The everyday tasks of life and maintenance take us a lot longer.\u0027The Giffords funded their trip through savings and money they raised during an 18-month stint living on their boat and working jobs on land in Australia.They also freelance on the move and continue to rent out their house in Washington, which covers their mortgage payments, taxes and maintenance.In total they\u0027ve spent around $300,000 in the ten years since they set off. The average cost of living for a family of five in Seattle, their hometown, is around $122,000 per year.The family are currently in the US for the summer but will be back on Totem by October and plan to sail to Mexico for a year and a half before returning to the South Pacific.Despite the fact Niall will be staying behind to study French and economics at college in Portland, Oregon, Behan said the rest of the family have no plans to return for good.She added: \u0027Everybody has to be healthy and happy. At some point my husband or I will keel over or we wouldn\u0027t be able to finance it.\u0027I fully expect it to happen at some point. I just can\u0027t imagine it now.

We have a lot of local trade and customers come from as far as Mill Hill and Muswell Hill.\u0027My parents were up visiting a few weeks ago and they\u0027re very proud of what we\u0027ve done here.\u0027 The article was published after his shop was awarded five stars by the Food Standards Agency and he won the Frymax Gold Standard Award for food quality.The furore over the train seats began when Ms Fitzpatrick, from Croydon, South London, said she joined the train mid-route before it terminated at London Victoria.The 33-year-old said that Mr Boon had a \u0027really awful manner\u0027 as he \u0027dismissively\u0027 turned passengers away from approximately 10 empty first-class seats on the train.    Earlier this week, a photo of Mr Boon posted by hairdresser Emma Fitzpatrick showing him then taking up two seats in first class - including one for his bag and jacket - went viral online, prompting  fury          Emma FitzPatrick tweeted this message with the photo after being shocked by his actionsShe confronted him about his behaviour as the train pulled into London Victoria, telling him: \u0027I can\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve done today. You should be hanging your head in shame.\u0027 Ms Fitzpatrick claims Mr Boon handed his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: \u0027Totally shocked to see Govia Railway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats in there.\u0027She continued: \u0027It was a London bound Southern Train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning.\u0027I still can\u0027t believe it. He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters\u0027 wounds.\u0027Describing her experience on the train, she added: \u0027I saw First Class had just two men sat in there, so lots of spare seats - around eight or 10 available. So I started squeezing past those stood up, to go and sit in there.\u0027But then a lady told me the man there - pointing at Mark Boon, had told her not to sit in there as she had gone to sit down.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. Then she showed me the business card he had given her. I said, \u0027You must be joking\u0027, but another female passenger nodded and said he had said the same to her.\u0027          Commuters on the line have experienced horrific conditions and delays in recent years          The franchise has been repeatedly criticised over the conditions on its trains. Pictured: 2017Ms Fitzpatrick said she made her way to the first class compartment - where Mr Boon glanced at her and immediately told her the same thing.\u0027He didn\u0027t even ask if I had a First Class ticket - he just looked at me and assumed I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she said.\u0027He told me the carriage was for First Class passengers only. I was so shocked.\u0027I told him I was feeling a little unwell so I needed a seat, but he dismissively said to go and get some water or something, and looked back down at his phone.\u0027I told him I would sit down on the arm of a chair, so as to keep the First Class seats free.\u0027I was just blown away looking back at the men and women packed in down the train.\u0027 Within 24 hours of sharing the photo, Emma\u0027s Tweet had been shared hundreds of times - with outraged Twitter users sharing their disdain.A Govia Thameslink spokesman said: \u0027Passengers need a first class ticket to travel in first class and there were other people with first class tickets in this compartment.\u0027This was an 11am off-peak service running just six minutes late and, while the front coaches were busy, there were seats and space in the rear coaches, as Mr Boon explained.\u0027       "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/16/4E2A688900000578-5946491-image-m-83_1531409213801.jpg","title":"Juncker struggles gala leaders step help","story":"    Jean Claude-Juncker bumps into the Presidents of Ukraine and Finland as a group of world leaders make their way to a gala dinner          Juncker took a remarkably long time to descend from a podium after a photoshoot with the other world leaders      ‘I’m a stable genius’: Trump declares victory in battle with...May warns Trump not to split NATO by appeasing Putin as she...Trump resumes his attack on FBI lovers en route to second...Share this articleJean-Claude Juncker addresses the media after the signature of the second EU NATO Joint Declaration on Tuesday            Delegations arrive for a working session of NATO leaders and the delegations from Ukraine and Georgia          President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during their bilateral meeting, Wednesday, July 11, 2018 in Brussels, BelgiumTrump created tension with Chancellor Angela Merkel after publicly berating Germany for its new Nord Stream 2 pipeline agreement with Russia.\u0027Germany is totally controlled by Russia,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027I think its a very bad thing for NATO,\u0027 Trump said.Several EU leaders, including Juncker were quick to kowtow to the President\u0027s demands, saying the EU must \u0027take responsibility\u0027 for its security.In a statement on Tuesday Juncker said: \u0027Europe has decided to take responsibility for its own security.\u0027NATO is a cornerstone of that strategy and we are working full steam to implement the 74 joint actions which go from countering hybrid threats to cyber security, defence and research.\u0027This partnership is a cornerstone of our overall security and defence strategy.

That is why he has long been so hostile to Britain, which has shown far too great a spirit of independence.Affronted by Brexit, he\u0027s a key architect of the EU\u0027s punishment strategy, compromising a refusal to negotiate constructively on one hand and, on the other, an extortionate demand for a so-called \u0027orce\u0027 settlement.His attitude makes it believable that he was behind the damaging leak about the MayJuncker dinner.Selmayr angrily denied he was behind this character assassination.Yet it seems to fit his anti-British agenda, as well as his record as an intriguer and manipulator.It\u0027s not the first time he\u0027s been accused of leaking to the press to undermine the British side in Brexit negotiations. Selmayr\u0027s attitude may have been triggered by an incident in his youth, when he was briefly a student in London.One evening in 1993, he went to hear Margaret Thatcher speak at an event to promote her memoirs. Although he bought a signed copy, he was appalled to hear her attack the dream of European integration. He came away with a sense that \u0027there is a big misunderstanding between Britain and the EU\u0027.           Juncker, never one distinguished by his own work-rate, calls his Chief of Staff, only half-jokingly, \u0027the Monster\u0027Contemptuous of national borders, laws, self-governance and identity, Selmayr is the classic European ideologue bent. Like one of Robespierre\u0027s unyielding revolutionaries during his French Reign of Terror, he is a political zealot, renowned for his dedication and brutality.Juncker, never one distinguished by his own work-rate, calls him, only half-jokingly, \u0027the Monster\u0027.His commitment is matched by his merciless intimidation which has created its own reign of fear in Brussels.He thrives on such a reputation, boasting that he keeps the Commission and its 35,000 staff under control. As for his Rasputin nickname, he says: \u0027If it means there is an efficient manager, somebody who is not a wimp, I\u0027m OK with that.\u0027 Others are not so happy.In 2016, Kristalina Georgieva, the EU\u0027s Budget Commissioner from Bulgaria, cited the \u0027poisonous\u0027 atmosphere that Selmayr created.A central part of the problem is Selmayr – a lawyer by training – often acts like the Commission President himself. One spoof Twitter account joked that Selmayr is now the \u0027Chef de drinks cabinet\u0027 for Juncker, but that is a gross misreading of the real situation. With typical ambition, Selmayr has exploited his boss\u0027s absences to acquire more political authority than any official in EU history. This, in turn, feeds his epic self-importance.                             Do you know the difference between Selmayr and God? God knows that he\u0027s not Selmayr                        German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble \u0027Do you know the difference between Selmayr and God?\u0027 the long-serving German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble once said. \u0027God knows that he\u0027s not Selmayr.\u0027That spectacular egotism often comes across as political thuggery.As with so many authoritarians, Selmayr seems to believe that the end justifies the means. In his case, the end is the creation of a united, federal Europe. He claims his belief in this vision was fired as a schoolboy, when his maternal grandfather Heinz Gaedecke took him to the First World War battlefields and military cemeteries of the western front, including those at Verdun.The lesson that young Selmayr absorbed from this trip was that Europe must unify to avoid the blood-soaked lessons of the past.But Selmayr also had a direct family connection to the darkest episode in Germany\u0027s history. During the Second World War his grandfather was a Lieutenant Colonel on the Wehrmacht\u0027s staff in the Balkans where he won three bravery awards – including the Iron Cross, first and second class.After the Allies\u0027 victory, Josef Selmayr was tried by a British military tribunal for war crimes, found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He served only five years, and on his release helped to create West German military intelligence.           Martin Selmayr (pictured second right) enjoys a drink during Oktoberfest in BrusselsThis painful family experience gives Selmayr another link with Juncker, whose father was conscripted into the Wehrmacht.But Martin\u0027s own upbringing was far less clouded by conflict. He has been accused of \u0027bossy, whip-smart legalism\u0027 – his lawyer father was an adviser to the office of the German President. Selmayr joined the EU\u0027s bureaucracy in 2004 at the age of 34.Ferociously ambitious, Selmayr spotted the potential of working for Juncker, whose spongy, erratic character was part of his appeal, as it gave far more scope for his chief of staff to have influence. Juncker duly became EU President in 2014, despite a strong campaign against his candidacy by David Cameron. His henchman Selmayr has been thwarting Britain ever since. He wants victory for the EU and humiliation for us.He was one of the diehard opponents of any concessions being granted to Cameron last year during negotiations for a new British relationship. He is just as uncompromising today over Brexit. But our Government cannot give in to this Teutonic oppression. Martin Selmayr\u0027s undemocratic antics must not be allowed to deny us our freedom and sovereignty."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/11/15/4E1F09D500000578-0-image-a-79_1531318208892.jpg","title":"Mobile phone lost 100ft underwater diver lit receiving text","story":"Result!

At the time they were aged just nine, six and four          The family decided to undertake their voyage in 2002 after the birth of Marien and the death of Jamie\u0027s mother coincided. It took them six years to prepare for the trip\u0027We had high-paying jobs, dual income. It was so perfect and white picket fence it was almost painful. It makes your teeth hurt.\u0027Then in a two week spell in 2002, our eldest daughter was born and my husband\u0027s mother passed away. It was hard to see those milestones of life happening together.\u0027My mother-in-law was going to go traveling but she had cancer and literally died within weeks.\u0027It forced us to think about our priorities and what we wanted, and when Jamie and I met this was something we were always going to do.\u0027We had been telling people we were going to take our children on a boat and sail and we didn\u0027t know when we would be coming back, and we got some looks like, You\u0027re crazy.\u0027When we left in 2005, we felt exhilarated and euphoric. I couldn\u0027t believe it. It was something we had worked so long and hard for.\u0027It\u0027s such a crazy, different way of life from the outside. On one hand, we have given up so much to do this but we have zero regrets.\u0027We barely saw each other before and now our family is very tight. We have had the most wonderful opportunity to experience the world with our kids.\u0027While there is no typical day aboard Totem, the Giffords wake up when the sun rises and sleep when it sets, bedding down in one of two cabins on their floating home.Behan and Jamie also homeschool their children, teaching them standard subjects as well as devoting time to cultural immersion and hands-on learning.The kids don\u0027t have mobile phones so there\u0027s no Snapchat or Instagram and they\u0027re \u0027not dialed in to popular culture\u0027, but they spend time relaxing or exploring.They also chip in with chores, including doing laundry without a washing machine, helping maintain the boat and preparing meals.They eat local wherever possible - rice dishes in Mexico roshi flatbreads in the Males - and stock up on vegetables and pasta at markets as well as catching fish.\u0027Before I went cruising, we could load up the minivan with a half dozen bags of groceries and walk them up to the double fridge,\u0027 Behan said.\u0027Now everything I\u0027m finding at markets and carrying it back, but I can only carry so much at a time.

The average cost of living for a family of five in Seattle, their hometown, is around $122,000 per year.The family are currently in the US for the summer but will be back on Totem by October and plan to sail to Mexico for a year and a half before returning to the South Pacific.Despite the fact Niall will be staying behind to study French and economics at college in Portland, Oregon, Behan said the rest of the family have no plans to return for good.She added: \u0027Everybody has to be healthy and happy. At some point my husband or I will keel over or we wouldn\u0027t be able to finance it.\u0027I fully expect it to happen at some point. I just can\u0027t imagine it now.

You should be hanging your head in shame.\u0027 Ms Fitzpatrick claims Mr Boon handed his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: \u0027Totally shocked to see Govia Railway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats in there.\u0027She continued: \u0027It was a London bound Southern Train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning.\u0027I still can\u0027t believe it.

So I started squeezing past those stood up, to go and sit in there.\u0027But then a lady told me the man there - pointing at Mark Boon, had told her not to sit in there as she had gone to sit down.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. Then she showed me the business card he had given her.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

And it really is newSweden’s librarians have spoken: a wonderfully eclectic lineup of authors has emerged on a long-ish longlist for the New Academy’s alternative to the postponed 2018 Nobel prize for literature.Traditionally awarded in autumn by the opaque and austere Swedish Academy, the Nobel was called off in March due to an ongoing sex scandal – and swiftly replaced when a group of the country’s cultural figures decided that the “world’s greatest literature prize” should still be awarded. “In a time when human values are increasingly being called into question,” the New Academy’s solemn opener read, “literature becomes an even more important counterforce to stop the culture of silence and oppression.”The New Academy asked Swedish librarians to nominate an author from anywhere in the world who has told the story of “humans in the world” – and the resulting longlist is surprisingly surprising. Yes, some of the perennial Nobel contenders are here, and deservedly so: Cormac McCarthy is nominated, as are Margaret Atwood, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, Amos Oz and Haruki Murakami.But the librarians have also added some fresh faces to the usual suspects: we have the fiction of Finnish rising star Sofi Oksanen, the fierce originality of Polish Man Booker International prize winner Olga Tokarczuk and the sizzling fantasy of Nnedi Okorafor (I love Who Fears Death and The Book of Phoenix so much I think Okorafor’s going to land my vote, but I’m not quite decided yet. How many lineups – for anything, let alone a literature prize – feature Neil Gaiman, JK Rowling, Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo alongside each other? As well as Patti Smith, rather more celebrated for her music than her books. Could she be this year’s Bob Dylan, the New Academy’s contender for controversy who will befuddle all by blurring the line between lyrics and poetry?Perhaps the most striking detail of all is found not in the names, but the fine print. The New Academy is enforcing a gender quota on the shortlist stage, stipulating that it comprises two men and two women. How different this is to the Nobel, which counts among its 114 winners just 14 women.Could a win bring the pseudonymous Elena Ferrante, also nominated, out into the open? The only thing to do is to cast your vote and see: the New Academy is now asking the public to vote by 14 August. The shortlist will then be put to the New Academy’s judging panel. How open. How inclusive. I can’t wait to see who they end up with."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95909f403a40b7c6704e78f30144e800d0704477/16_133_2069_1242/master/2069.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6088079e29d0c30a31e22a262bcd841","title":"uk to pass 1000 hours without coal as energy shift accelerates","story":"Revival of last eight plants when ‘beast from the east’ hit Britain proved to be briefBritain will soon have been powered for more than a thousand hours without coal this year, in a new milestone underscoring how the polluting fuel’s decline is accelerating.The UK’s last eight coal power plants staged a brief revival when the “beast from the east” pushed up gas prices earlier this year, causing coal plants to fire up.However, the blip proved short-lived and immaterial, figures compiled by MyGridGB show. The country is expected to pass the threshold of 1,000 coal-free hours before the weekend is out and possibly as early as Thursday night.The pace of coal power’s demise is speeding up. Throughout the whole of 2017 there were 624 coal-free hours, up from 210 hours in 2016.Andrew Crossland, an energy expert who runs the MyGridGB site, said: “In 2018, Britain saved its coal use for when it needed it most – during the March cold snap. The decline will deepen in the second half of this year, with the planned closure in September of a Yorkshire coal plant and one in Northern Ireland. After Eggborough and Kilroot cease generating there will be six coal plants left.For the first time since the industrial revolution, the UK went a day without coal last year, followed this year by three days in a row.Coal’s fortunes have been in contrast to a series of record highs for renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar and biomass.The recent weeks of sunny weather have also created a series of solar records. The most recent was a new high for solar output over a month, with 1.94 terawatt hours of power generated between 10 June and 9 July, beating the previous record of 1.77TWh.Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said: “Some of this increase is due to more solar having been installed since 2017 but most of the increase is climatic, with summer 2018 being the fifth sunniest on record so far. “These figures highlight the growing importance of solar energy as a low-carbon and low-cost source of electricity.”Ministers have pledged to phase out coal entirely by 2025 but generation will dwindle well before then. The government’s own projections forecast the amount of power from coal plants between 2019 and 2025 being less than was produced in 2015 alone, Friends of the Earth pointed out.Cottam in Nottinghamshire and Fiddler’s Ferry in Cheshire are thought by observers to be next in line for closure, from October 2019, when their contracts to supply backup power have expired. Drax in Yorkshire and Ratcliffe in Nottinghamshire are likely to be the last to close in the face of unfavourable economics brought about by the UK’s carbon tax and gas being cheaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2cdb87753f0aab6ddfb6065149f25c0bc91bbe4/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f431a361fae01d13d1e9c084dfd98428","title":"church of england cathedrals","story":"The £27m growth programme just announced by the Church of England is of itself a very good thing. It will fund some desperately needed, creative and exciting initiatives across 10 marginalised and deprived areas, including more cafe-style, drop-in churches, debt coaching services, and networks of community support workers to engage with families and young people. These projects are part of efforts by the church to reach out to the communities it seeks to serve and bring about positive social transformation.But these initiatives need to be part of a bigger sea change in how the church approaches its work. The pattern of priests in single parishes may have served the church and the country well for hundreds of years, but society has changed. This parish structure, with 16,000 churches, is failing because younger people are not joining churches. They do not have a pattern of going to services on a Sunday morning or evening. Rural areas recently have had some priests in charge of 12 or more parishes – with almost as many church buildings, many ancient and crumbling, all in need of heating and maintaining.If the church wants to survive, and thrive, it will need to see itself in a new light – more responsive, and willing to embrace how people live today. Most people, especially young people, don’t want to have to step through the doorway of a church to engage with the big issues of life. They don’t want to sit in pews on Sunday mornings to listen to a sermon or a set, age-old liturgy. They want to know how to navigate the complexities of their lives and how to address their deepest longings, doubts and fears. And they want to feel safe.So the whole church will have to become much more interactive and flexible. The pattern for the future may well look a lot more like the early church, with small groups meeting in each other’s homes. Some of the independent churches that meet in old cinemas or shopping malls draw crowds because of having brilliant resources for people of all ages in all kinds of families. It’s telling that cathedrals continue to show a steady rise in visitors, which can’t all be explained by a love of heritage.A different way of working will demand different skills and talents, and therefore new ways of training clergy, who will need to learn to communicate without jargon and without any assumptions of a shared knowledge of the faith. They will need to be able to offer coherent Christian perspectives on contemporary issues and events, and expect lively debate.The structure of the Church of England also needs reform. No Christian church should ever be only in the business of saving souls. Part of the church’s mission is to call out unjust structures and practices, including any it finds within itself: the recent inquiries into abuse by clergy in Chichester and other dioceses have revealed a disordered system. The church is still recalibrating what it needs to do differently in order to end, once and for all, a culture of abuse, collusion and cover-up.The General Synod refused last week to accept a House of Bishops report that failed to take into account changing views of marriage. Synod members from the Christian LGBTI community felt their experiences and their understanding of Christian teaching and doctrine on sexuality had been largely ignored. As a result, the bishops acknowledged that they needed to do more “listening”.Richard Rohr, an American Franciscan, claims it has taken a long time for Christians to be able to see the gospel in a fully historic, social and political context. One can only pray that the Church of England’s initiatives will help to bring about the kind of real transformation, structural as well as spiritual, that the world needs now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac6cdd4ea490473a0a6af3b3830e28297875951/211_130_4747_2848/master/4747.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cc6104c1fcee890245270f9872a91b5","title":"eu britain brexit plan chequers theresa may","story":"Britain is making a fair and reasonable proposal, given the compromises that the government has had to makeDear Ambassadors and High Commissioners,I write regarding the British government’s Chequers plan, a white paper on which is published today. It’s two years since this country voted to leave the EU, and with just months remaining of article 50, I’m sure you will welcome more details on the UK’s Brexit proposals.All of you represent EU member states at the Court of St James’s in London. You must be spending a lot more of your time on Brexit than you would probably like to do. You might think your country didn’t choose Brexit, and that it’s a headache you could do without. But you would also recognise that the EU treaties themselves afford every member an option of leaving the union, in accordance with its constitutional requirements. That’s just what the UK has decided to do.Skilled diplomats, you are used to dealing with the world as it is, not as you would like to find it. And I’ve seen how you and your colleagues have turned your efforts to the challenge of finding a way through Brexit, to making sure that the UK maintains the strongest possible relations with its European neighbours, as they evolve on to a different level.For over four and a half decades, the UK has been a committed EU member, pressing for the completion of the single market and the extension of membership to countries of the former eastern bloc. Yet we always had a more detached relationship than many of our continental allies. We chose not to join the euro and the Schengen area. Frankly, we have always been more interested in a trading relationship than a political project. And liberal Euroscepticism has had a strong foothold here, on the political centre-left and centre-right, and in the press.Although the prime minister, Theresa May, made clear over a year ago that Britain intends to leave the EU’s single market and customs union, it has taken the government too long to come up with a more detailed plan on Brexit. Now, finally, it has.We need a path to a balanced relationship that would work for future decades. Most European leaders agree that this will have to be a bespoke relationship, designed to suit our size and proximity, as well as the historical, economic, personal and cultural ties between the UK and EU.So far, however, the European commission team, which negotiates on your behalf, has only offered the UK two unacceptable choices. On the one hand, Michel Barnier suggests a thin free trade agreement, which comes with the coda that the EU would indefinitely control regulations for the province of Northern Ireland alone – something that many in the UK see as an attempted “annexation”. On the other hand, there’s a relationship even closer than Norway’s, inside a customs union and single market, which would limit the UK’s ability to end free movement or control regulations across its wider economy. The latter would almost certainly prove politically unsustainable in the medium term, and – as we saw with Brexit itself – unsustainable political relationships tend to unwind in the UK.The Chequers plan tries to put forward an innovative, bespoke option for a new partnership with the EU. Essentially, it would entail the UK aligning with EU single market rules on goods, but able to erge on services and end free movement. The purpose would be to maintain essentially frictionless goods trade to support growth in all of our economies, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland.Some on the EU side claim that the free movement of goods, services, people and capital is “inisible”. But the EU has already entered relationships that ide these, and which allow partial participation in the single market – such as those with Switzerland or Ukraine.Others claim the UK wants to have its cake and eat it. Yet the Chequers plan would leave the UK with fewer obligations but also fewer rights. We would lose the ability to set rules on goods regulation, and would lose rights on free movement of services and capital.As a (soon to be) non-member, the UK cannot expect the EU to change its fundamental order to suit us. But equally, the EU should be able to accommodate a deep partnership with Europe’s second biggest economy and major security and military power. Although the UK is just one country, in size we are equivalent to the smallest 19 EU members. It behooves all of us to find a way to work out stable relations on our continent at a time when the transatlantic security alliance itself is at risk, and when all around Europe, and within it, we face unprecedented challenges.Your capitals will be looking closely at the detail of the Chequers plan today. As you will be reporting back – given recent ministerial resignations – this is very close to the maximum compromise the UK could sustain politically. The government has moved substantially to get here.I hope this proposal is taken seriously by European member states and the EU itself. I believe it should provide the basis for a future partnership. But if it’s judged insufficient, then I fear the British people will think that the UK has already made a fair and reasonable offer. They would be very wary of further compromise , and so regrettably our relations will probably end up being looser, with concomitant effects on both sides of the Channel for economic growth and security cooperation in the future.• Henry Newman is the director of Open Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0871e1c12b18674a6e356b6203c25fe80f5dc87e/0_240_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ff817696758500c86b74edb12f5444","title":"fahrenheit 100 summer britain climate change heatwave","story":"I don’t know anybody who remembers 10 August 2003 and its significance, although the date has never faded from my mind. That was Britain’s hottest ever day, the day the current British air temperature record was set: it leapt from the old record of 37.1C, set on 3 August 1990, to the new figure of 38.5C.Those bare numbers may not mean much to you, though they may well appear more meaningful if you convert them to fahrenheit. For the old record was 98.8F,but the new one was 101.3F, and that meant that the 100F barrier had been broken in Britain for the first time ever. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that this was a hugely symbolic crossing of an environmental threshold yet the population instantly forgot all about it.The current heatwave bids fair to be the longest period of sustained hot weather since the fabled summer of 1976. But will it actually be the hottest? Might we actually see a new British record air temperature? Local records are already being broken and there was a brief flurry of excitement 10 days ago when it appeared that the Scottish national record had been smashed with a temperature of 33.2C (91.7F) recorded in Motherwell, but now the Met Office has rejected the claim because a vehicle with its engine running was too close to the thermometer.It seems a new British record is certainly possible this summer that, if achieved, would give considerable force to the suggestion that the very high temperatures that have been in evidence all over the northern hemisphere this summer are at least partly the product of global warming, rather than just natural variation.For anyone interested in following and watching out for this, I have a suggestion: keep your eye on the fahrenheit as well as the celsius measurement it will mean more. I say this as a baby boomer who grew up with F rather than C it was not until 1962 that the Met Office adopted celsius, and in my early childhood I acquired the instinctive feel that everybody then had (and people still have in the US), which told you that, in fahrenheit terms, 60 was pleasantly warm, and 70 was really lovely weather, and 80 was seriously hot, while 90 represented the sort of heatwave that was a major event. Anything approaching 90 would result in front-page headlines in the  proclaiming: “88 … 89 … 90! Phew! What a scorcher!”That was the point about the 100 figure. It was off the map. It had never been recorded in meteorological history, in the daily temperature records that go back to 1772. But it had no place in cultural history either. There was no reference point for it: no stories, no memories, no jokes, no newspaper headlines. In our native land of showers and cool summers, 100 degrees fahrenheit represented an unknown country.The round number certainly helped. In celsius terms, 100F is 37.8C, and of course 37.8C as such isn’t any sort of figure the mind will register, any sort of boldly marked frontier whose breaching will seem significant. But once you represent it in fahrenheit, the move up from two digits to three has a symbolical significance of real power.That’s what I thought, anyway, in the years I spent writing about climate change and being something of a temperature nerd, waiting for the 100 mark to be hit, for “the ton to be up”. When the 100F threshold is broken, I thought, everyone will see at once that we are in new territory in terms of climate everyone will perceive the reality of global warming, in an instinctive way. And in August 2003 the day finally came, and I remember vividly how hot it was and the day went and people carried on with their business just as before, and have forgotten it completely.Yet my own view is that we did indeed enter new territory that day and if we have waited 15 years to get back there (and maybe we will wait still longer), it merely illustrates what we know, that climate change proceeds in a non-linear way, in irregular jumps rather than a smooth ascent. But watch out for it, this sweltering summer (probably in the first week of August) watch out for it on the old-fashioned fahrenheit scale as well as on the modern celsius. And if you see that the ton is up, and 100F is exceeded, be assured that even if a new outright temperature record is not set, the world is changing in the profoundest of ways.• Michael McCarthy is the author of The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77788dc4310c9723e0aae1428318f3dde5888e99/0_189_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce1a25924ffa2fcfa06a5e5712036884","title":"the guardian view on englands world cup savour the wins learn from the defeat","story":"The sheer gaiety of England’s unexpected success at the World Cup in Russia was bewitching.

The whole national set-up has appeared unable to learn from failure, with its atrocious record on penalty shootouts – now corrected by Mr Southgate – the most glaring example. After the Sweden game, the manager spoke of his pride in the team’s resilience and togetherness. Crushing disappointment is sure to test both.

Norway’s huge $1tn sovereign wealth fund has only partially ested from fossil fuels, targeting some coal companies, and is still considering its oil and gas holdings.The fossil fuel estment movement has grown rapidly and trillions of dollars of investment funds have been ested, including large pension funds and insurers, cities such as New York, churches and universities. Supporters of estment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong and economically risky. However, some critics argue say that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. The Irish fossil fuel estment bill was passed in the lower house of parliament on Thursday and it is expected to pass rapidly through the upper house, meaning it could become law before the end of the year. The Irish state investment fund holds more than €300m in fossil fuel investments in 150 companies.Meehan said: “Just last month Ireland was ranked the second worst European country for climate action, so the passing of this bill is good news. But it has to mark a significant change of pace on the issue.”Gerry Liston at Global Legal Action Network, who drafted the bill, said: “Governments will not meet their obligations under the Paris agreement on climate change if they continue to financially sustain the fossil fuel industry.

But she still can’t get a followup off the ground It’s a familiar story: a young director heads to the Sundance film festival with their debut feature. The crowd is wowed jury likewise. The movie gets picked up for a major distribution deal and is deemed an instant classic. But while the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, Robert Rodriguez, Richard Linklater, Darren Aronofsky, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson and the Coen brothers have converted Park City acclaim into enduring careers, even Oscars, things turned out rather differently for Leslie Harris.I meet Harris, now 57, for tea at the Trade Union Cafe in Brooklyn, not far from the home she shares with her husband, a New York Times photographer. Soft-spoken and gentle, she was born in Cleveland, Ohio. She loved cinema from an early age and, spurred on by her touring-musician father and a mother big on female empowerment, moved to New York to pursue a career in advertising, before jacking it in to shoot her first movie.Its $130,000 budget came from a day job temping, night work at a non-profit film organisation that provided equipment in exchange for time, occasional gigs directing commercials for beauty salons in her neighbourhood – and, when cash dried up in post-production, cheques from the author Terry McMillan and the film-maker Michael Moore.Just Another Girl on the IRT (1993) is the moving and exuberant story of Chantel (Ariyan A Johnson), an outspoken 17-year-old black girl, a top-grade student slated to graduate from her Brooklyn high school a year early, her eyes set on a career in medicine. The film’s poster was one of the first to feature a young black girl solo its tagline was: “If you think you know her, think again.”Harris had already had a lifetime of being prejudged and underestimated Chantel was an expression of her desire to prove people wrong. “I would see these young girls getting on the train after school and they would be so loud, people would go to the next car,” she says. “There was a stereotype that people had. I wanted to follow these young people home, to see what they were really about.” It wasn’t just the women who got stereotyped: when she pitched the script to studios, they wanted Harris to make Chantel’s boyfriend a drug-dealer she refused.Chantel breaks the fourth wall in the film, telling us how she seeks not to be defined by her background, or by the personal challenges that threaten to overcome her. But the real story is how her intelligence is often taken for granted by the people in her life, particularly men, black and white alike, who see her as a mouth to be silenced, rather than a mind to be cultivated.The film stormed Sundance, taking home the special jury prize and attracting the attention of Miramax, with whom she brokered the first ever wide-release deal for a film directed by an African American woman. It hit more than 200 screens in the US and travelled to 20 countries beyond. Harris was lauded as a game-changer. And then … nothing. Twenty-five years on, Harris has yet to make a second movie – just like Julie Dash, another black female director, whose debut film, Daughters of the Dust, took top honours at Sundance two years before.What happened? “I had scripts right out the bat after Just Another Girl,” says Harris. “Which I thought were interesting: people loved them. And my agent said,: ‘Well, I can’t get them funded. We can’t get a film financed with a black woman lead.’”The problem, thinks Harris, was always to do more with gender than race, both in front of the camera and behind. Back then, black people were making movies, but they were all men: Spike Lee, John Singleton, Ernest Dickinson. “If you look back at the 90s, it was really a boys’ club – Boyz in the Hood, Juice, Straight Out of Brooklyn, Hanging With the Homeboys. There were very few women who were getting that attention. Hollywood was embracing black males.“The difference for me is that they didn’t really want to tell stories about black women, and they surely didn’t want to have a black woman behind the camera.” She even had one such director tell her that she was “in the way”– taking up a valued token spot that should have gone to him.Harris has mostly spent the past quarter-century teaching, at colleges across the US and as a professor at New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Some screen work has come her way: she made a short for Showtime about Bessie Coleman, the first African-American pilot, which she struggled to turn into a feature. At the moment, she is still trying to get funding – as she has for the past five years – for a second movie, I Love Cinema, a sexual satire about a sophisticated and outspoken academic called Layla who becomes involved in a cinema-inspired racial controversy (Layla is evidently something of a spiritual relation to Chantel – and, indeed, to their creator). One Kickstarter attempt in 2013 ended up with just $4,074 of its $35,000 goal.Aspiring black female directors may be concerned by her example, but at least, she says, she has retained her integrity. “I made the film I wanted to make,” she smiles. “Never give up. I’m the perfect example, after 25 years. Tides change. The climate changes. Never compromise too much of your story.”Leslie Harris will attend screenings of Just Another Girl on the IRT at the Cinema Rediscovered festival at the BFI Southbank, London, on 27 July and Watershed, Bristol, on 28 July "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00d67cc7082a88ef3f7c6c7d5be8be6e1cc783b4/0_149_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43b1b93bd0af53b7df70ecf74287b163","title":"mira sorvino casting director gagged me with a condom at 16","story":"The Oscar-winning actor claims that during one of her first auditions she was tied to a chair, bruised and gaggedMira Sorvino has claimed that a casting director gagged her with a condom during an audition at the age of 16.The Oscar-winning star of Mighty Aphrodite revealed in an interview with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s podcast that she was auditioning for a horror movie when the situation got out of hand.“In looking back over at my career, I realized that one of my very first auditions when I was 16, I was completely treated inappropriately by the casting director,” she said. “In order to scare me for this horror movie scene, he tied me to a chair, he bruised my arm, and I was 16 years old, and then he gagged me, and I was all game because I’m trying to be scared for the scene.”She continued: “And at the end he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said, ‘Sorry for the prophylactic,’ so he had gagged me with a condom. I was too young to even know, thank God, what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate, and what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket in an audition?”In the same podcast, Sorvino also called out “one big director” who she says “has Oscars” and is known for his “social justice profile” who ended an audition by saying: “You know, as I look at you my mind can’t help but traveling from the artistic possibilities to the sexual.”Sorvino had previously come forward with her own story about disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, alleging that he sexually harassed her. Peter Jackson later revealed that Weinstein had told him not to consider her for a role in The Lord of the Rings as she was difficult to work with.The actor has also apologized for working with Woody Allen on Mighty Aphrodite, the film that won her an Oscar for best supporting actress. In January, she penned an open letter to his daughter Dylan Farrow, who claims that he molested her as a child. “I cannot begin to imagine how you have felt, all these years as you watched someone you called out as having hurt you as a child, a vulnerable little girl in his care, be lauded again and again, including by me and countless others in Hollywood who praised him and ignored you,” Sorvino wrote for the Huffington Post. “As a mother and a woman, this breaks my heart for you. I am so, so sorry!”Sorvino was recently seen in the mini-series Condor and her upcoming roles include thriller Look Away with Jason Isaacs and comedy Stuber with Dave Bautista."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de8b3950d63f634375f2938054e78119da83c9c/0_301_5759_3456/master/5759.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee92333dc5ca5d5318c9156dfa92fb5","title":"summer 1993 review carla simon","story":"Carla Simón’s brilliantly realised story of a six-year-old traumatised by the death of her parents features miraculous child performancesThis autobiographical debut from 32-year-old Spanish film-maker Carla Simón is a jewel. In its subtlety, richness and warmth it is entirely beguiling – complex and simple at the same time. It is also very moving. Summer 1993 is about childhood and a child’s fraught relationship to the adult world, and has some of the most miraculous child performances I can remember seeing recently, although the concept of “performances” and “acting” are meaningless with children this young: two little girls of six and three years old. There is something awe-inspiring in realising that, to all intents and purposes, what we are seeing is real. The moment-by-moment interplay of emotions and dramatic gestures between these children is effectively innocent of grownup play-acting and pretend.It is a classic premise for a film about a remembered childhood – although the act of remembering is only implicit, contained in the title. This happened more than 20 years ago. Frida, played by Laia Artigas, is a lonely six-year-old who has been sent away from her home in Barcelona to live with her aunt and uncle and their infant daughter in the countryside: a long, drowsy, lazy summer is in prospect before Frida must enrol at the local school for a new term. But there is nothing idyllic about it. Frida is going away because her mum has just died, and it appears her father had also died, a few years previously. Frida is in shock, or she is simply too young to process what is happening. A mean kid in the first scene jeers at her: “Why aren’t you crying?”Her mum’s brother Esteve (David Verdaguer) has agreed to take in little Frida, and effectively raise her as his own daughter, and he is supported by his partner Marga (Bruna Cusí). They are a relaxed and loving couple, but taking in Frida has clearly not been easy. They have a three-year-old, Anna (Paula Robles), and suddenly giving her this difficult elder sister has messed with the family dynamic and pre-empted the unspoken question of whether they might have another child. Then there are Frida’s grandparents, chiefly her formidable and Catholic grandmother Àvia (Isabel Rocatti) who makes Frida recite the Lord’s Prayer whenever she sees her and makes her carry her late mother’s holy communion certificate with her all the time.And how did Frida’s mother die? The rumours have been getting out among Esteve and Marga’s neighbours. Frida is given blood tests by a local doctor. When she falls and cuts her knee while playing at the local park, paranoid parents grab their own kids and tell them to go nowhere near Frida’s blood – to Marga’s silent rage. And Frida herself makes tiny uncomprehending Anna play dressing-up games in which she will play Frida, and Frida will play her own mum: in heavy makeup, a childish parody of borderline-slutty grownup clothes, while drawling, “Mummy is too tired to play with you, darling” – a poignantly bizarre performance inspired by the jazz sax that just happens to be playing on Esteve’s radio. And then Frida herself becomes increasingly dysfunctional: selfish, petulant, with odd coquettish mannerisms evidently learned from her mother. She is coldly jealous of Anna having a mum and dad, becoming an increasingly disruptive and even malign presence: there is even something of We Need to Talk About Kevin going on. Marga becomes afraid of her, which makes their reconciliation all the more powerful. Simón has a masterly way of controlling long, wordless scenes involving just Frida and Anna: the very essence of kids just aimlessly playing among themselves, and then wonderingly realising that something might be very wrong. The film often just gives us bedtime or bathtime scenes and lets them run to the end in what feels like real time. There is quiet wisdom in that.

The Italian even took training on Thursday morning before, with the players sent home for the afternoon, confirmation came of his sacking.Chelsea have yet to comment but it is understood Conte said his farewells to his players on Thursday lunchtime after training.He had a year to run on a £9m-a-season deal, renegotiated last summer in the wake of the league championship triumph, and will be due a hefty payoff. Conte is likely to take a sabbatical while he considers his next move. It remains to be seen whether Chelsea can strike an agreement to compensate the 48-year-old across the remainder of his deal, though that is unlikely to be easy.Relations between Conte and the Chelsea hierarchy had always been difficult but deteriorated markedly over a difficult second season with regular disagreements over transfer policy. The Italian wanted greater say over recruitment, and would have sought a radical overhaul of the playing squad this summer following last term’s disappointing fifth-place finish. Players such as David Luiz and Willian would have been moved on, though Chelsea were also concerned Eden Hazard might opt against signing a new long-term contract while Conte remained at the helm.Sarri, who led Napoli to second place in Serie A last season, is expected to be confirmed as Conte’s replacement imminently, with progress having been made between his lawyers and those representing Napoli and Chelsea in the last 48 hours. He had been replaced in Naples by Carlo Ancelotti but not released from his contract, forcing the London club to pay a fee to secure him. Chelsea are likely to pay around £50m, with further fees due in bonuses, to secure the Italy midfielder Jorginho and Sarri.Jorginho’s arrival will belatedly kickstart the club’s summer transfer business, with Daniele Rugani and Aleksandr Golovin to follow from Juventus and CSKA Moscow respectively. Thibaut Courtois is expected to depart having entered the final year of his contract, forcing Chelsea to consider a move for Roma’s Brazil goalkeeper Alisson.Gianfranco Zola is expected to be given a role to work alongside Sarri in some capacity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cff71d4d914a8a5d47340070f5aafce2b31a0585/0_134_4012_2407/master/4012.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=693a51e4fa350f5714d0d4332f28a8d1","title":"dejan lovren croatia world cup best defender","story":"• Liverpool defender says Croatia’s win was answer to his critics• Lovren says his side ‘made history’ against EnglandDejan Lovren believes he has proved himself as one of the best defenders in the world after helping to steer Croatia into a first World Cup final, and suggested his team’s ability to see off England at the Luzhniki Stadium boiled down to strength of character.The Liverpool defender, who missed Euro 2016, grew into Wednesday’s semi-final and, seven weeks after enduring crushing disappointment in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, will now confront France on Sunday seeking to secure his country’s first World Cup. Croatia will be motivated further by the chance to avenge their semi-final loss to Les Bleus 20 years ago, though Lovren already feels he has restored his nation’s reputation, as well as his own, at the tournament in Russia.“But this criticism is what gets me more motivated to work harder and prove everyone wrong. Everyone. From today, everyone in Croatia and around the world saw we managed to make history. In 20 years’ time, people will remember us, and not just the team from 1998. That is why I am proud, and now we have one game to make people remember us forever.“It is special history when you look back and see we had to play 120 minutes three times and we still had fresher legs than that England team. The difference was mental because we knew we could write history and we did it.“We went through a lot of shit: war, all these things, and even now the situation is not the best. But it is unbelievable how many talents we have in sport. At basketball, at handball, at water polo, at tennis especially. We have good mothers and fathers, making good love.”Zlatko Dalic’s team, who eventually prevailed courtesy of Mario Mandzukic’s 109th minute winner, will now attempt to recover their energy levels after a third gruelling knockout game in succession that has gone to extra time, with memories of 1998 fuelling their intent. Croatia took the lead at the Stade de France against the World Cup hosts courtesy of Davor Suker, only for Lillian Thuram’s brace to see France through despite Laurent Blanc’s controversial dismissal.“I was nine and I remember my mum was screaming and crying after the French game,” said Lovren. “Maybe it’s our time for revenge. It’s going to be a tough game, it will be difficult, but we have a good chance to give them something back for 20 years ago.“For me, it is beautiful. If somebody had told me at the beginning of the season that I would play in two of the biggest finals in the world, I would have signed up straight away. I went through a lot of shit. Unfortunately I didn’t win the Champions League, but there is still this. I believed more that I could win the Champions League – I believe that from day one because we had the power and speed at Liverpool – than coming here to Russia. Here we have different players, but we have showed we can manage. France are definitely the favourites, there is no hiding from that, but we love to be the underdogs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1d5ab98f294ce86c021f9f74765d8ee2159e52/315_81_1460_876/master/1460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa110925d968f9778d20eafa30b0eb44","title":"england dream over itv roy keane ian wright tv","story":"The absence of Slaven Bilic from the studio was an early blow but later Keane seemed to take a little bit too much pleasure in England’s defeat for Ian Wright’s likingBefore kick-off ITV tried to enhance the excitement by transmitting rallying cries from Joanna Lumley and Prince William, plus footage of Ricky Gervais interviewing a dog. That turned out to be more tolerable than Gabby Logan’s interview with Harry Maguire on the BBC the day before, when Logan was reduced to asking the centre-back whether he liked tea and where he got his head. Uncharacteristic for Logan but symptomatic of a tournament in which the BBC have mostly been outplayed by their rivals.It was a blow, however, that ITV’s four-man panel for this one did not include Slaven Bilic, the Croatian having asked to cover the match from the stadium. Bilic has created gripping dramatic tension in the studio throughout this tournament, using expansive arm movements to illustrate his points and almost literally to poke those around him, a habit that seemed certain to culminate in Roy Keane sticking the nut on him. Defusing that by allowing Bilic to go to the Luzhniki did the watching millions a disservice.At least Bilic appeared pitchside, expressing his confidence that England’s “very open football” would play to Croatia’s strengths. “It’s going to be the kind of game we’re good at,” he reckoned.In the studio Keane was to act as a counterweight to English giddiness - or “to restore some calm,” as Mark Pougatch put it rumly. But Gary Neville, Ian Wright and Lee Dixon were not getting carried away. Wright even opted for his tamest shirt of the campaign, a marine blue number with sharks or dolphins. Dolphins are playful and intelligent. Perhaps some cute subliminal messaging there from Wrighty.The English trio tentatively predicted a win for the Three Lions. Keane did not commit to tackling that view. “If they show enough courage, they’ll win the game but they’ve been in this position before and messed things up so let’s see,” he advised.Once the game got going so did Clive Tyldesley, acclaiming “a Bolshoi spin by Lingard” early doors. When England took the lead, the commentator felt no spin was required, just a statement of facts: “It’s in! Kieran Trippier’s first goal for England is in a World Cup semi-final inside five minutes. Dreams do come true.” To which Glenn Hoddle, with not quite the same sense of moment, added: “It was central, as I said.”Less than 10 minutes later Tyldesley captured the nation’s mood by swooning as Maguire got his head to a corner. “What a threat he carries!” simpered the commentator, who almost choked on his “oh!” when Harry Kane bungled a later chance.At half-time the lads in the studio were concerned England were not further in front. Keane said sloppiness had crept into their play. “If England don’t finish this off, they’ll never forgive themselves,” he warned. Bilic was nowhere to be seen. But he was probably wrapping his arms round someone in the 68th minute when Ivan Perisic scored. Tyldesley paused before reporting: “Croatia have equalised. Really good cross, good run, good finish. England have got to pull themselves together.” By the 84th minute Tyldesley was annoyed enough to quip: “I thought Croatia were supposed to get tired”, a rebuke to Neville, who had declared “if it goes to stamina, we win”.Full-time came with the game in the balance but Tyldesley seemed in need of a hug as he cut to ads.Soon Mario Mandzukic struck Croatia’s second. “Oh, it’s in!” yelped Tyldesley in horror. From then on it seemed he was just waiting for a chance to lie down and sob. Bilic popped up again after Croatia’s win was confirmed. “It’s good for all smaller countries, and also for Wales,” he ventured, mischievously shoving pressure on to Ryan Giggs, standing within arm’s reach to his right.So England were out. But, in a sense, Keane’s tournament was just beginning. This was his time to shine. Wright felt he had been waiting for it all along. “You weren’t happy for us being happy,” he blurted. “I didn’t mind you being happy but you were getting carried away,” retorted Keane.“You were planning the final, where the parades were, you need a reality check – you’re a grown man!” To which Wright replied by mocking his accent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1354667bde231dc9aae3742dfe4ecfee0f7c37c7/555_365_2810_1686/master/2810.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0d5941d8c6a86d7527bba4236b389","title":"england unbelievably inferior croatia press world cup semi final","story":"A wave of euphoria hit Croatia after the national team defeated England 2-1 in the World Cup semi-final and, befitting the historic achievement, it was a wave of epic proportions.The Vecernji list newspaper went with the headline “We knocked the English down, Croatia are in the World Cup final!” with Zeljko Jankovic writing how Croatia and France will now decide “who plays the best football on the planet at the moment”. It turned out to be rhetorical as he answered it himself by adding: “It’s Croatia, don’t even doubt that!”Vecernji’s website devoted an unusual amount of space to gloating over the fate of the losing team, with headlines such as “Football’s not coming home”, “The arrogance hit them back”, “The English are sore losers” and even published a photo gallery titled “Look how the English cry after losing to Croatia” with pictures of downbeat players and fans.The 24 sata daily published a video from the team’s hotel, where players can be seen standing on a dinner table and singing along with veteran entertainer Mladen Grdovic. “Pinch yourself and don’t worry, you aren’t dreaming, this is reality,” wrote Marko Snidaric. “Close your eyes without any fear, and when you open them you’ll see Croatia celebrating. You’ll see Croatia crying. Out of happiness.”Jutarnji list gave central space to quotes from players. “Croatia is burning, but we haven’t burned down yet,” Danijel Subasic said. Sportske novosti, the nation’s only daily sports newspaper, was full of praise for the manager, Zlatko Dalic, claiming he has outdone every other Croatia coach by leading the team to the final. “France, who are better than England, can hardly stop them,” wrote Drazen Antolic. “That will be a true final, a top clash between the two sides who have shown the most at the tournament.”Index.hr, a popular website, acknowledged that England were the better side in the first half, but when Ivan Perisic scored, Sasa Cobanov said, “it was the beginning of the end for the English”.Telesport’s Juraj Vrdoljak compared Croatia’s second-half comeback to an “adrenaline-driven man lifting a truck to save his child”. Croatia emerged victorious, he stated, after “clinching her teeth and biting on a knife in the manner of Cholo’s commandos before using it to rip the history apart at the finishing line”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b988a659c63b7a63bb2375f9d321d0ce022b42a7/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=014109f7819b4a8b4295d4c0b09ae86e","title":"kelly smith fox sports analyst world cup","story":"The former England and Arsenal striker had a brilliant playing career. And now she is forging a reputation as an insightful analyst in AmericaTwo decades before Kelly Smith became a studio analyst on Fox’s World Cup coverage, she was a star on the pitch at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. But as fearless and prolific as she was on the pitch, she was terrified of live microphones.Smith had arrived in 1997 from England to become the Big East Conference’s newcomer and offensive player of the year. So she was invited to a post-season conference banquet to accept her awards and, perhaps, say a word or two to the audience.“She was gone,” says Betty Ann Kempf Townsley, who was the Seton Hall head coach at the time and had recruited Smith. “I said to the girls, ‘Where’s Kelly?’ She was in the bathroom, plastered against a wall.“She said, ‘I cannot go up and speak in front of people,’ so I had to talk for her. We’d have people from all over coming into talk to her, like ESPN, with the big-time lights and all, and she would just sit there and not know what to say.”Smith, now 39, went on to have a magnificent college and professional career in both the United States and the United Kingdom, scoring a record 46 goals for England in 117 international matches before she announced her retirement as a player in January 2017.At Seton Hall, she had also long overcome her fear of public speaking. Through the last 16, Fox and Fox Sports One averaged 2.54 million viewers per World Cup show – a lot more people than the crowd at the Big East soccer banquet 21 years ago.“I finished my playing career wanting to stay involved with soccer in the media,” Smith told the  this week in a telephone interview from Russia.Smith has made a gradual transition to broadcasting after her retirement from the international game in 2014 (she carried on playing for Arsenal until last year). Her first TV job was at the 2015 Women’s World Cup in Canada, won by the United States. She did well enough for Fox to ask her back to be one of three women featured on their broadcasts from Russia 2018.The others are studio host Kate Abdo, who is also English, and color commentator Aly Wagner, a former US international who on 15 June became the first woman to call a men’s World Cup match on American television.Smith lives in London and is not sure what broadcasting assignments she will get after the World Cup. But she is determined to pursue a living as a soccer analyst – “They call them pundits in England,” she said with a laugh.England’s run to the semi-finals in Russia has been an unexpected bonus for Smith, who has received extra air time at the Fox studio because of her knowledge of her national team.A video went viral of her spontaneous off-camera celebration with fellow England and Arsenal striker Ian Wright, who also played professionally for Arsenal and internationally for England, after Dele Alli’s goal essentially clinched their team’s place in the semi-finals.“There were no expectations for the young English side,” Smith said, speaking before their loss to Croatia on Wednesday. “There was hope they got out of their group, but you didn’t really know what would happen after that. A lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon. It’s fantastic for an England native.”She acknowledged, however, that many fans of other countries are watching Fox’s coverage, saying of England, “You want them to do well, but you have to control that.”Smith played in her first international for England when she was 17, then scored 76 goals in just 51 career matches at Seton Hall, leading to the retirement of her No6 jersey. But she later overcame several challenges as a player, including serious leg injuries and a dependence on alcohol. She was still shy, but she’d begun talking to friends and coaches like Kempf Townsley about the possibility of becoming not a coach, but a broadcaster.When Kempf Townsley contacted her late in 2014 to arrange a trip to one of England’s games at the upcoming Women’s World Cup, Smith told her that she’d retired from international football and was joining the Fox broadcast team instead.“I turned on the TV the first day of the World Cup and Kelly is on,” Kempf Townsley said. “I walk in there and start laughing. She could not speak in front of people, and here she is, speaking in front of millions of people every day.”Kempf Townsley is not exactly an impartial observer, but she said Smith is good at breaking down the action and is simple to understand. When Smith played at Seton Hall, Kempf Townsley said she never had to explain much about tactics to Smith. She was a natural."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e53e1880c1ef768b906c57be492fb6cbf25e1ba3/0_167_5024_3014/master/5024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1458f6f5c8e9adac0dacaf1d72406db9","title":"penny finally dropped newly disciplined paul pogba","story":"The France midfielder has been a revelation in Russia, sacrificing his own game for the benefit of the team in a manner rarely seen during his Manchester United careerSamuel Umtiti was first up, with Paul Pogba to follow, as France looked ahead to Sunday’s World Cup final against Croatia with a press conference out by the magnificent New Jerusalem Monastery to the west of Moscow. If Umtiti had any illusion about his warm-up act status, he was disabused of it within seconds of pulling his chair to the table.“Ladies and gentleman, I present Paul Umtiti,” the France federation media officer said, before wishing that he could have his time again. To be fair to Umtiti, who has been in fine form at the tournament, he took it well. The Barcelona centre-half stood straight up and, to no little laughter from the audience, strode off in mock a fashion. He would return.Everybody was waiting for Pogba and it was ever thus but particularly so before this World Cup, after his erratic season at Manchester United. What sort of Pogba would turn up? The smart money was on the celebrity midfielder, who must give free rein to his talent and, if that means overlooking the dirtier aspects of the job, then fine. It was the attitude that had driven the United manager, José Mourinho, to distraction and it was one that helped to place a significant wedge between them.The Pogba that has shown in Russia has been a revelation. It has not been on the same scale as Kylian Mbappé, who has electrified France’s progress to a fifth major final in 20 years, but it has been a revelation nonetheless.“It’s a pleasure to defend,” Pogba said, early on in his Q\u0026ampA session and, at that point, you almost had to rub your eyes. Mourinho, from his seat as a pundit for RT, has to have been doing the same.How has Didier Deschamps managed to draw such discipline and balance from him? Or, to put it another way, how has the France manager succeeded where Mourinho has so often failed?“Pogba played with great maturity,” Mourinho said of his performance in the 1-0 semi-final win over Belgium. “When he had to hold his position and keep control of the game, he did. When Deschamps took off Oliver Giroud for Steven Nzonzi, Pogba had more freedom but freedom not to do silly things. Freedom to keep the ball away from the dangerous areas. To keep the ball, to assist Antoine Griezmann for a great chance. He was very, very mature.”The impression has been that a penny has somehow dropped in Pogba but why should it be? How has he come to strip things back to what truly matters, a theme he reinforced when he considered Mbappé’s outrageous touch and backheel that almost laid on a goal for Giroud against Belgium? “If you do a great move and it’s efficient, it’s good,” Pogba said. “But if you lose the ball, it’s bad.”Perhaps, it is the enormity of what is at stake or, maybe, the effect of having N’Golo Kanté alongside him. It is fair to say that Pogba has not always played with this degree of control in a central midfield two for United. Another theory is that there are 89 million reasons for Pogba to feel he has to turn on the style at Old Trafford – equating to the fee that the club paid to take him from Juventus. Yet another is that it is simply down to greater experience this is not Pogba’s first World Cup, rather his second. Whatever it is, self-sacrifice has been the theme for him.“It is a World Cup and we have to sacrifice,” Pogba said. “We have to defend. It’s not what I do best but I do it with pleasure. We have the same objective and it is to win. I think I have become more mature and all the other players help me a lot on that.Antoine Griezmann, for example, is a forward but he talks to me. He tells me to go back to defence. If I get better, it’s thanks to the team and the coach.“The second World Cup is different to the first one. You play against teams with experience, against great players and I also cannot play the same way as I play for my club. We have found a balance with everyone and with N’Golo Kanté.We run together, attack together, defend together – it’s when we are strongest. Even the critics have helped me to improve but that doesn’t mean they should start criticising me!“I think the image that people have of me has changed. I am playing as a midfielder now, which is my role. I am being less offensive. I think people judge me now on my role as a midfielder and not as a player who can score goals and make assists.”Pogba is 25 but, according to Umtiti, he has always been a leader. Now, the feeling is more pronounced. Pogba is one of the strongest voices in the squad. His presence fills the room. “Patrick Vieira gave me some advice,” Pogba said of the former France captain. “He told me to talk, to give out advice and I do it now. Vieira has always been an example. He is a born leader.”Pogba and France have narrowed their focus. The run to the final has been exhilarating but it will count for nothing if they do not beat Croatia. That is the mentality and it has been shaped by the experience of Euro 2016, when they beat Germany in the semi-final and expected to sweep past Portugal in the final. They would lose 1-0. Over-confidence was their downfall. This time, they are determined to see the job through.“At the Euros, we probably thought we had already won it before the final,” Pogba said. “When we beat Germany, we thought it was the final. We are aware of that mistake now and we don’t want to repeat it. We will prepare differently. The holiday after 2016 was horrible. I still remember it. It was a very bitter taste and no one wants that again. We haven’t come this far to lose in the final.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d7c376cfb2701a4dff503f68b9bfb40257e1de/243_19_3082_1849/master/3082.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44abbf9629c0615dccfb9d7582528bda","title":"riyad mahrez manchester city 60m record signing","story":"Manchester City’s record signing, Riyad Mahrez, is confident he can not only break into the champions’ first team but also help improve it.Despite City spending £60m on the 27-year-old, questions have been asked about where the former Leicester forward will fit into Pep Guardiola’s plans. City have Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva on the right flank and Leroy Sané on the other so the need for an extra wide player in not immediately obvious.Yet not even City are likely to have broken the club’s transfer record for a squad player, and it is probably also significant that having narrowly failed to capture Mahrez in January, Guardiola was prepared to wait patiently for his chance to make a move in summer.“I haven’t talked about my precise position with the manager yet, but City wanted me and that means a lot,” Mahrez said. “The price tag doesn’t affect me – fees for players have got very big in the last couple of years. I am very happy to be here and will try to give my best for the club. I thought what City did last year was amazing, it was unbelievable to break all those Premier League records, but I am confident about myself. I want to help this team improve and I believe that is what the manager wants.”Mahrez knows he will have to adapt from being a regular pick at Leicester to proving his worth in a stronger setup at the Etihad but he is prepared for the challenge. “Players at top clubs always have to face competition for places, it is normal for big clubs to have a lot of great players and City are a big club with a big manager,” he explained.“They have everything they need to succeed in the Champions League and that’s where I want to play. They want to go further in Europe each season and I am here to try and help them.”Like everyone else Mahrez has been watching the World Cup this summer, keeping in touch with Harry Maguire and Jamie Vardy and sharing the Leicester pair’s pain when England went out. “I think England deserve a lot of credit for what they achieved.

At 20 years old, he went straight from the show to a ridiculously charming turn as a judge on Bake Off: The Professionals. It didn’t revolutionise the genre – same suspense-building piano music, used exclusively and perhaps invented for competitive cooking, same high tensions generated by the composition of an egg – but it did revolutionise the potential of that genre. Charles has a face of such open-hearted admiration that it takes you straight back to first principles: this isn’t a game! Some of this stuff is really delicious!He is now publishing Cheeky Treats, a gly, Technicolor, many-faceted recipe book, whose title completely underplays the intricacy of its ideas. It is distinguished not by the two kilos of icing sugar in the Football Cake (and that’s just the buttercream!), nor the very simple, incredibly effective, domino pattern on his salted millionaire dominoes, nor his vertiginous layering or moments of French patisserie perfectionism, but by the joie de vivre conveyed by all those things, and the rest. “I think I’m a nice person,” he says, in his publisher’s office in central London, “regardless of the cake. I don’t like upsetting people. I just like making people happy. I thought cake was the best way.” Here, then, are his top baking tips.By the age of 15, “I could do cupcakes, cakes to a certain standard, I dabbled in pastry and bread. I did biscuits from time to time. I was solid.” Already, Charles’s friends had christened him Cake Boy, a nickname that stuck throughout his time on Bake Off.Charles went on to study drama at Goldsmiths, University of London two years ago, and will graduate this coming winter. “Over that summer between school and uni, that’s when I developed the most. That’s when I started to do chocolate work, tier cakes. If you make a four-layer cake, there is some kind of drama, you’ve got all this buttercream, and you’re like: ‘What’s inside? What’s inside?’ So there’s suspense there. There are more similarities between baking and drama than people think.”I am sceptical about the suspense – you are more or less assured that, underneath the icing, there will be cake – but no one could deny the impact of, say, his chequer cake, regally tall and plush. To those mystified by how you could fit it in your mouth: “You’ve just got to pace yourself, and enjoy it.”Mother’s day 2016 and Charles wanted to spring some doughnuts on his mother. Although a kitchen enthusiast herself, they didn’t bake together throughout childhood. “I was fixated on cake, I treated everything like a cake,” he says. Without a deep-fat fryer or any experience of proving dough, failure – burnt on the outside, raw on the inside, the texture of a padded cell if you brought yourself to eat it – was inevitable. “I did think: ‘Shall I leave this? Maybe it’s not my thing’. But it’s not in me to do that, so I just finessed it and finessed it. And the day I just bagged it was an amazing experience. But it took me months.”Charles still lives with him mum and his sister, and has a brother, too. He mentions his dad in passing – he used to take him to play football on the other side of London – but is extremely reticent about his family. The most detail you’ll get is about how many burners the oven has (six). His mum, he says sphinxishly, works in an office. Is it a secret, what she does, or have you just not asked? He smiles: “It’s definitely an office.”Goldsmiths, says Charles, was a haven of enthusiasts: no such thing as too experimental, even if that meant taking on a life-consuming TV commitment partway through a term. “They were, like: ‘Do what you have to do, as long as you come back to uni.’” When he finished Bake Off, placing fifth, he returned with three weeks to do his third-year project, a monologue he’d written himself, called The Metaphorical Meanings of Buttercream. “If I was going to go the easy route, it would have been clowning, because I’m apparently a very animated person. But I thought: ‘No, let me just test myself and find a deeper meaning with this piece.’ Most of the time, I’m mad positive, and when you’re really positive and hyper, people think you don’t think about things. So when I did show that level of intelligence, they were like: ‘Woah, he is a deeper brother.’” This is a motto borrowed from one of Charles’s baking idols, Christina Tosi, the US baking entrepreneur behind Milk Bar, and star of a Netflix Chef’s Table. “Because she comes from such a humble background, and her baking is still so humble, she stays true to herself through baking even though she’s on this massive scale now. That’s why people watch other people cook the interplay between the character and what they’re making. When something goes wrong, or when something’s good, people watching it really feel it.”Bake Off had been Charles’s dream since school, but even when he applied and got through, he thought it was probably a trial run. “If you’re not surprised to get on, you’re not human. It’s an audition process, there are so many stages, I just kept thinking: ‘If I get to this stage, that’ll be cool, I’ll go back next year. Oh, I’m through to the next stage.’ I cherished every single moment.” During his time as a contestant, Charles insists he had no rivals, “no competitive beef with anyone in that tent”, his worst and only enemy being himself. “I always want to do well, and sometimes getting up in my own head could be to the detriment of that. So I was constantly thinking: ‘You can do this, so shut up.’”Charles’s baking life hasn’t been without its flaws: one time he made a custard tart in a too-hot oven, and ended up with a beautiful looking pastry shell full of scrambled egg. “I haven’t had any training in it. It’s like baking instinct. It’s like Messi and Ronaldo, that’s why they’re so clearly above everyone else. You can have training but you have to have that extra sauce or that extra belief in what you do. I’m not calling myself Messi, by the way.”Cheeky Treats: 70 Brilliant Bakes and Cakes by Liam Charles is out on 12 July, available for £17 at the  Bookshop.

Now whole neighbourhoods are being styled to look good on social media. But by viewing the world through a screen, do we miss the bigger picture?If you are ever in Madrid and looking for a bite to eat, you could do worse than to head to Sobrino de Botín. At the world’s oldest restaurant – it opened in 1725 – you can experience a well-reviewed suckling pig supper, while soaking up the atmosphere. It was once frequented by Ernest Hemingway and is still hugely popular, but that has not stopped TripAdvisor reviewers describing it as “cramped” with “narrow stairs”. In the 18th century, lighting and ambience would have come secondary to the food and some good booze (as Hemingway himself said: “My only regret in life is that I did not drink more wine”), but in 2018 the customer demands much more. In this digital age, the places we choose to visit, eat and stay at increasingly need to be Instagrammable. Design has become, if not all, then at least the starter and the dessert.This new priority doesn’t just mean creating food that can be photographed for social media, although plenty of eateries already cater to that need with the likes of grey ice cream and multicoloured bagels. Instead, the challenge for businesses is to make their premises attractive to social media influencers, so they pose up a storm in front of your store or hotel, luring in followers hungry for the perfect photo opportunity.Evelyn’s Cafe Bar, in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, has capitalised on the modern customer’s desire for a photogenic backdrop. Angus Pride, the manager, says he was inspired by cafe culture in Los Angeles, “as that felt most aligned to the concept of Eastern and Middle Eastern small and large plates we deliver”. Social media imagery was never part of the bar’s original plan, but “when we realised we were so ‘Instafriendly’, we adapted our approach and it’s now key to everything we do.” The cafe uses a mixture of textures and materials and is full of the obligatory hanging plants, but, says Pride, it puts a premium on design that has “longevity over something more contrived for the purposes of social media”. It is not just interiors that are being reshaped. Renowned architect Richard Rogers considers the Tuscan town of Pienza, now a world heritage site, as the first great attempt at a humanist urban design. Under Pope Pius II, the town was remodelled in 1459 around a main square that feels like an outdoor room - encouraging visitors to linger and revel in its beauty. When I lived in Shoreditch in London, I often wondered what the Pius would make of the way it does the same, but in a very different way.Shoreditch, often prefixed with the word “trendy”, works hard to seduce anyone with a smartphone. Its cafes and restaurants are stuffed with hanging plants, rose gold and inspirational signs, details designed to be featured online. Because of the murals, pop-up shops and famous flower market, this often means a quick dash to the shop for milk is hampered by tourists’ impromptu photoshoots, thanks to the endless opportunities for stylised social media posts. A day spent in Shoreditch, a place where everyone’s gaze is filtered through a lens, can begin to feel almost unreal.The spectacular regeneration of King’s Cross in London in recent years has gone further. Glittering glass buildings have shot up alongside plant-covered walls, colour-changing fountains and kitsch billboards. Every part of the area now features something that looks like a prop - from steps covered in fake grass where people eat lunch to a giant neon swing that cries out to be photographed. Then, at King’s Cross station, there is the fictional platform 9¾ that featured in the Harry Potter books, where fans queue to “crash” through the barrier. There is even a professional photographer to mark your moment.Kate Beavis, an expert in vintage interiors, thinks this kind of pop-up urbanism is becoming the norm. “The things you see on Instagram, such as pastel-coloured houses and walls, seem to be becoming more visible in cities and suburbs. Instagram selfie-wall opportunities are cropping up everywhere, even at events. This is now the norm, so it makes sense for architects to plan them in. What will happen is that all our communal areas will take on a new look and feel to match the Insta need, but, in reality, this is what a trend is: something popular that works into our spaces and life. In 10 years, it will be something else.”London is not alone when it comes to installations that pander to our need for visual entertainment on our streets. In statistics released by Instagram for 2017, New York was the most photographed city, followed by Moscow and London. But, perhaps more than anywhere else, Los Angeles has realised and harnessed the power of social media when it comes to design. A city nestled below the famous Hollywood sign, it should not be much of a surprise that the demands of the lens are important to residents. Alexandra Lange, the architecture critic for the interiors site Curbed, points out that it it is home to one of the first cafes to catch on to social media. “Intelligentsia’s Silver Lake Coffeebar (designed by Bestor Architecure) is one of the first examples – everyone took a “shoe-fie” on its tile floor.” A search on social media shows the venue is a riot of colour, where the deep blue tiles command the most attention the cafe now has 20,000 tagged photos by customers on Instagram.Amelia Perrin, a writer and Instagrammer with more than 10,000 followers, is keen to visit places that will provide her with a good photo. Some restaurants, such as the Dirty Bones chain, offer a “kit” to help you get the best shot. “I’m definitely swayed to go somewhere by amazing looking food, but places that make amazing-looking food know it will be captured, and tend to make the interiors match the food in terms of ’gramability, which makes sense when social media is a sort of currency nowadays.” While Perrin says she wouldn’t go to places just for nice decor, she believes venues know that food and decor “definitely go hand in hand” in importance. “I’m more than happy to go to a crappy-looking cafe if I’m told the food is incredible, but who wouldn’t want to sit in beautiful surroundings instead?”Perrin admits that she is swayed by venues that look great in photos. “I wanted to go to a beautiful cafe for my birthday afternoon tea, so we went to Mad Dogs and Englishmen because I’d heard the interiors were stunning. They do rotating afternoon tea themes and I didn’t even bother to check the menu or what we would be eating because I was so excited about how the interiors looked, whereas usually I meticulously check menus. The food was amazing in the end, but I definitely chose to go there based on photos I’d seen of the decor.”Stefani Ellenbecker, the executive director at lifestyle blog Wit \u0026amp Delight, echoes the need to keep design functional and evergreen in the face of huge social media trends. “For us, it is more about what feels best or looks the most cohesive rather than always striving to stay ‘on trend’. Because we are increasingly viewing life through our phone lens, I think our lives, in a way, are becoming distorted. In our designs, we always try to encourage ‘functionality’ first and foremost.”It is not just venues and neighbourhoods that are adapting their spaces for the smartphone generation. Museums and public buildings now look to social media to raise visitor numbers. The Louvre is the most photographed museum on Instagram – unsurprising when critics have long bemoaned the daily scuffle to get a photo of the Mona Lisa. But the museum’s popularity has recently been boosted by Jay-Z and Beyonce’s decision to film the music video for Apeshit there. In response, organisers have introduced a 90-minute tour on which you can view the art featured in the video (and, naturally, take selfies to prove it).Other venues are hosting exhibitions that go bold on scale, colour and interactivity. Rain Room, an installation at the Barbican in 2012 that made you feel as if you were caught in a torrential downpour, has now travelled around the world and been documented by hordes of people. In Venice, sculptor Lorenzo Quinn’s giant pair of hands reaching out of the canal and stretching up a building became the photograph for tourists to get as they chugged by on a waterbus. It is unclear how many of them knew that the sculpture was intended to highlight climate change and the threat it poses to the island city.The art critic Waldemar Januszczak, in a review in the Times of the Frieze Sculpture exhibition (currently on show across Regent’s Park in London), praises the reinvention of public sculpture: “It used to be pious, repetitive, dull. Now it is inventive, varied, fun.” As you walk around the display, there are giant penguins, oversized Wendy houses and glass boxes alongside gleaming towers and even a gloomy un-inspirational quote: “Everything is lost.” But it is hard to ignore the number of people viewing the exhibits solely through their phones, using the art as a sidekick in a fun selfie, or perhaps just wanting others to know that they have imbibed some culture and not just spent time sunbathing.The best example of the power of the new breed of online photographer was perhaps the 2017 retrospective of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama in Los Angeles. Tickets sold out within an hour. While Kusama’s paintings and objects were on show, the real draw were her “mirror rooms”. One visitor, in their quest to take a great image, damaged an installation and a 30-second time limit in each space was swiftly implemented. The popularity of these spaces, packed with kaleidoscopic lights and seemingly endless mirrors that enabled the perfect selfie, ignited a debate about whether the way we have consumed art has changed. Are we simply using it now to bolster our own image?According to Culture Track, a 2017 report by a marketing firm that tracked more than 4,000 cultural consumers in the US, respondents said they would rather have fun than be educated by cultural offerings, and preferred experiencing new things to learning something new at exhibitions. The study also found that the majority of responders wanted digital experiences in all cultural activities.Perhaps those surveyed should consider the US Museum of Ice Cream. Far removed from the educational school trips of your childhood, here you can jump into a pool of sprinkles, gambol in a field of gummy bears and, most importantly, document the whole experience. The venture has become a digital phenomenon, with more than 160,000 tagged posts on Instagram. Photos show giant sweets, unicorns, happy people on pink swings and others posing in the mocked-up supermarket.Alexandra Lange points out that new attractions, such as this or the Colour Factory, another travelling exhibition, seem to have been designed almost entirely for the crowd with cameras. “What looks good in a photo is a very shallow, static backdrop with a bright colour or scintillating pattern. But that has very little to do with comfort or flow or dwell time, which require depth and choreography and, usually, places where the eye is more attracted to the people you are with than to the decor.”Attractions such as Dreamland in Margate have even created a whole day out designed for you to snap away – signs that used to say “no photographs” increasingly now plead with you to “please take photos!” and add their hashtag for good measure.What does this all mean for innovation in design? The more we rely on our smartphones, the more our ability to concentrate seems to dwindle, so the shops and spaces we visit are forced to work harder to offer us new ways to experience life through our gadgets. We shouldn’t be surprised if the places we frequent begin to blur into each other. As Lange says: “Designing from Instagram for Instagram seems like a snake eating its own tail. Everywhere looks like everywhere else and the eye grows tired of bananas or concrete tiles or mirror rooms.”So many of us seem to view our surroundings only as a backdrop to our personal portfolio. But this comes at a cost. In the myth, when Narcissus looked down into that wonderful pond, it wasn’t the beauty of nature he admired: all he saw was his own reflection. Now it seems we are all content to dismiss the beauty around us in favour of fiddling with filters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977af6d63d0acfb7aca97cee753703f74e973937/0_0_5907_3545/master/5907.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7a6b174b7184a6f8babc4e7505caa19","title":"quiz what kind of a sharer are you","story":"From crisps to feelings, sharing feels good.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Scooter Braun explains why managing pop stars is perfect training for politicsPerfectly on time, Scooter Braun strides into a small, windowless room at Cannes’ Midem convention, the annual gathering of the world’s music business. For someone who has just flown in from the US, he looks remarkably good: suit and shirt perfect, no hint of jet lag. But these are good times, even by Braun’s standards. The man who once sold fake IDs at university could now reasonably claim to be the biggest manager in pop, with a personal fortune estimated at $23m (£17m), thanks to his involvement with the likes of Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen, as well as canny investments in Spotify, Uber and Dropbox. He has just announced the first film to come out of his studio, Mythos – an animated movie called Cupid, with Justin Bieber voicing the title character – and the founding of a reality TV company, GoodStory Entertainment.His relationship with his most wayward artist, Kanye West, is back on, after a “rough” couple of weeks in which West fired him, apparently enraged at Braun’s refusal to get rid of all his other clients and work solely with him. West announced that he couldn’t be managed (Braun favourited the tweet) in a media rampage that also included doubling down on his support for Donald Trump and appearing on TMZ to suggest that slavery was “a choice”. A “manic moment”, suggests Braun, brought on by the rapper’s bipolar disorder.Then there was the saga of Bieber’s 2013-14 fall from grace, a classic teen-idol-gone-wild scenario involving rumours of problems with alcohol and prescription drugs and a string of arrests for vandalism, driving offences and assault. It should have been the stuff of career-ending disaster. Instead, here Bieber is, clean, sober and a bigger star than ever, thanks not just to the exceptionally well-made 2015 album, Purpose, but also to a public rehabilitation that Braun says he began planning the moment Bieber “looked me in the eye and said: ‘I’m making a change.’”Braun won’t be drawn on what went wrong in the first place, other than to say that he thought Bieber might die. “I was not going to give up on him, I was not going to let him die, I was not going to put him in that position of: ‘Oh, let’s just keep him working.’”He says he isn’t worried that Bieber’s recent born-again Christianity may affect his popularity. Bieber was baptised – in the bathtub of a New York Knicks player, no less – by Carl Lentz, a pastor from Hillsong, a Pentecostal “megachurch” that has attracted criticism for its views on homosexuality. “At the end of the day, I would choose this result over what I was dealing with, a thousand times over,” says Braun. He thinks for a moment. “The best thing that happened to Justin Bieber is that he found God. He was able to remove himself from being worshipped, and realise he’s in service to others. Because I don’t think human beings are built to be worshipped.”Throughout it all, Braun has maintained a remarkably high profile for a pop manager. If he is scrupulously deferential to his clients in interviews – insisting it is Bieber who deserves credit for turning his own fortunes around, and that Braun only gave a speech from the stage at One Love Manchester because Grande didn’t want to do it herself – he is nevertheless very visible. He has more than 4 million Twitter followers tuning into a stream of plugs for his artists, photos of his family and self-help homilies. Rather than denying that he seeks the limelight, he says it was part of the plan from the start, devised when he was still a student.A well-raised Jewish boy from a nice part of Connecticut, he faced down antisemitism at school – someone carved a swastika into his car when he was elected class president – and went to study in Atlanta, promoting hip-hop parties as a sideline. One year, he says, Puff Daddy co-hosted a party with the manager of Outkast, then the world’s biggest hip-hop act. The next year, Outkast had split, their manager was no longer their manager, and Puffy was hosting a party without him. It was a cautionary tale never to make Braun’s success dependent on someone else, although he knew that building his own brand would be isive. He never aspired to be a manager, he says, and, at 37, admits that he will be annoyed if he’s still at it in his 50s. “I love working with the people I work with,” he says. “I’m blessed to be a part of these people’s stories. But their story is not just going to define mine.”There are frequent suggestions that he might enter politics. Last year, it was reported that the Democrats had approached him about running for governor of California. He was, he says, “getting pressured to do so at certain points”, but thinks he would be better off “doing good work in the private sector”. As well as One Love Manchester, he worked behind the scenes helping to organise the post-Parkland shooting March for Our Lives. “I think I still have unfinished business on the business side of my life,” he says. “If I were to go into a public-office position, I would want to remove myself completely from the business world.”He would be very convincing on television. When you ask him a question, he thinks for a moment, then the answer emerges, perfectly articulated, without an “um” or an “er” to be heard. He doesn’t appear to be much plagued by self-doubt, although he does keep bringing up the fact that he is nearly 38 as though looming middle age might blunt his self-proclaimed ability to identify a gap in the market and find an artist to fill it. “Am I going to tell you what I think the gaps in the market are today?” he asks, incredulous, when I mention it. “No, because I don’t want competition.”He has, it is true, repeatedly turned out to be absolutely right when everyone else suggested he was wrong. He graduated from promoting parties to working for Jermaine Dupri’s So So Def label, but left after a few years because, in part, he says, no one would listen to him telling them that social media was the future. “People thought I was crazy,” he nods. “I had ideas of using YouTube to break an artist by making video content, and everyone said: ‘You can’t take an artist off YouTube and make them into a star – this lo-fi content is not how you break an artist.’ When I first started saying artists should tweet at fans and follow fans on Twitter, people were like: ‘Why would you do that?’”He claims that the moment he clapped eyes on Bieber – on YouTube – he knew exactly how to make him the biggest star in the world. “I don’t even think it came from me. I’m a person who believes in God,” says Braun. But no one else believed him. “I took Justin from 60,000 views to 66m. An independent artist who was No 2 on YouTube in the world: no one would sign him. No one.”He says that “doubt and disrespect” drive him. Certainly, he seems to have a photographic memory for everyone who has ever slighted him, from a kid at school who disrespected his father to a basketball coach who is now in jail from Piers Morgan (who accused Grande of “running away” when she returned to Florida after the Manchester bombing) to rock manager Peter Mensch, who announced that Bieber’s drink-and drug travails didn’t matter because “no one’s going to remember his name in three years anyway”. “And that was four years ago,” he says, in dish-best-served-cold style. “Or five, I believe, at this point.”He has to go to another interview, this time on stage: he is Midem’s big star booking, the first recipient of its hall of fame award. The audience greets him like a conquering hero. He tells them that “anyone who says they make their own luck is an asshole” and that Kanye West “doesn’t have a malicious bone in his body”. He had told me exactly the same thing earlier: what a great guy he is in person, how much he cares about people, how those who make fun of him are mocking someone dealing with mental health issues. “There are things he has said that I vehemently disagree with. Do I let him off the hook? No, I have conversations and I try to push the points of where I am, and I wish the world could get to hear what he’s saying in those private conversations because I think it would explain a lot and also clarify what he really meant. But, y’know,” he shrugs, “he’s Kanye.”Wouldn’t your best advice be for him to just keep off social media? There’s a pause and, for once, an “um”. “Yeah. I mean, look, if you’re in a good place, yeah, go on social media.” And then, like the politician he may become, Braun neatly changes the subject. “But I’d also say I’m more concerned with the president of the United States being on social media than I am with Kanye West.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af2226b28f06859b21ed031309c85a96bca2905/0_0_2048_1228/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d47dc34e8e7a4e75c17d5a08cd7bae08","title":"simon le bon duran duran shereen hariri","story":"Duran Duran singer says the claim that he groped Shereen Hariri during a public appearance in Los Angeles is ‘simply untrue’Simon Le Bon has denied sexually assaulting a fan in 1995. Shereen Hariri alleged that the Duran Duran singer groped her while signing autographs at the Los Angeles record store where she worked. She accused Le Bon of grabbing and “massaging” her “right butt cheek” and “making his way down my butt to my genitals”.Le Bon has denied Hariri’s claims in a post on Duran Duran’s official Facebook page. “The behaviour that Ms Hariri has accused me of would have been just as inappropriate and unacceptable to me then as it is today. But the allegation is simply untrue. When Ms Hariri first contacted me about her claim months ago, I proposed meeting with her in person so I could set the record straight. Instead, she has decided to pursue this publicly. I have always been one who can admit to my mistakes and apologise for my failings. But I cannot apologise for something I did not do.”Hariri’s lawyer told the Detroit Free Press that Le Bon had pulled out of a proposed meeting with Hariri, which prompted her going public. “We were within a hair’s breadth to do a sit-down with him,” said Sarah Prescott. “At first he was kind of, ‘Yes, well, maybe later.’ It was just not gonna happen. Her view was, ‘Let’s just let the sunlight in.’”Hariri, 47, said that the incident left her “shocked and completely frozen”. She was “afraid of the consequences” of confronting the singer. “If I made a scene, I’d be in the press: The ‘Girl Who Accused Simon Le Bon’. I’d probably be fired, rejected, ignored, even hated.”The release of the Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump bragged about using his fame to assault women spurred Hariri to change her mind. “I decided that time’s up. I’m not holding this secret any more. I want everyone to know what this man did to me. I hope he comes clean publicly. I hope he make amends to his wife and daughters.” She clarified that she was not seeking compensation – the US statute of limitations for assault is two years – but an apology. Le Bon’s assistant, Katy Krassner, said she was at the record store event and supported Le Bon’s denial in a comment posted beneath his statement. “I can tell you that what he is being accused of DID NOT happen. Simon was never out of my sight that entire day, as each of the people on the Duran Duran team were ‘assigned’ to a band member to help with the record signing. Apart from anything else, as any fan knows, these kinds of events are a whirlwind of quick handshakes and photo calls which literally last a matter of seconds. The idea that he sat there, right next to his band mates, in front of a bunch of cameras, reaching behind him to sexually assault someone that day is simply ludicrous.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1ad3221914f911f7f70e91821f37d949e759a8/124_196_1257_754/master/1257.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cecf358549e7137ae336465379ef2d7a","title":"techno titan nina kraviz people were suspicious of a pretty woman making music","story":"The Russian producer became techno’s most isive figure after filming an interview in the bath. Here, she discusses sexism, her ‘emotional’ DJ sets and raving on the Great Wall of ChinaMusicians are often said to be on top of the world, but rarely are they actually perched on one of its wonders. Way up in the misty hills of Mutianyu, north-east of Beijing, the Siberian DJ and producer Nina Kraviz is soundtracking sunrise at the Great Wall of China. Forty ravers have gathered on an ancient watchtower to dance as dawn breaks, while two replicas of terracotta army soldiers preside over the decks beside her.A few hours earlier, the authorities had cut short Kraviz’s headline show at a nearby festival, claiming – incorrectly – that it was overrunning. So, this otherworldly afterparty feels subversive. It is being livestreamed on Facebook, which is banned in China, along with most western social media. Wine is passed around as though it is the prohibition era. Kraviz’s metallic sound feels thunderous enough to bring the terracotta warriors to life.Moments like these are why Kraviz has become the most talked-about DJ in techno. One of the first women to become a headline act, she thrives on challenging her audience. Her sets stand above other DJs’ slickly synchronised, clinically pristine beats as she plays fast and loose with ghetto house, old-school hardcore, footwork, trance, drum’n’bass and her favourite genre, acid. Her style is unkempt, never dull.“I’m not a psychopath,” she laughs. “I’m just extremely emotional.” An interview with Kraviz is as trippy and impassioned as one of her sets. Her body clock is back to front we end up talking in her hotel room at midnight the next day. Chain-smoking in her dressing gown, she spends an hour explaining how techno has been “underestimated” as a genre. “It’s a phenomenon, it’s as important as jazz,” she says. “It’s incredibly rich, culturally, but it’s so underground that it took me 15 years to have even a little bit of a frame of reference. There are still areas that I don’t know about.”Kraviz’s techno education started in her hometown of Irkutsk and developed in the early 90s (she won’t disclose her exact age), when she would listen to early-hours radio broadcasts of electronic music on the Europa Plus network. By the end of that decade, she was living in Moscow, working as a dentist at a war veterans’ hospital by day and holding down a club residency on Friday nights. She briefly fronted the band MySpaceRocket, but left to focus on her own productions after being told she was “just a singer”. Two of her tracks, 2009’s Voices and 2010’s I Am Gonna Get YouPain in the Ass, were released by labels outside Russia, putting her on the dance music map.But sexism was a problem. Back in the mid-00s, the male-dominated dance music scene struggled to get its head around a woman who knew what to do with electronic hardware. In 2012, she released her self-titled debut album, a collection of simmering 808 love songs and gauzy techno-pop. While “some people loved it”, says Kraviz, “people were suspicious of a pretty woman making music on her own, with a vision. They couldn’t handle me. It was like: ‘It cannot be true that you can have lipstick on and make music.’”A year later, she starred in a video portrait by dance music site Resident Advisor, during which she was interviewed in the bath. A picture of a foamy, playful Kraviz was plastered across blogs and ided the club world. The criticism levelled at her – including from male peers – said she was putting “sexuality” before artistry, as though the two were mutually exclusive. The renowned house DJ Seth Troxler called Kraviz a “bitch” in an interview.“With me, people feel very loose in expressing their opinions,” she says. “It sometimes seems like it’s bad to be a sexist, unless it’s about Nina Kraviz.” If a man had been in the video, she says, the focus would have been their music: “I was one of the only artists at that time who had made an album without ghost producers.” Still, she doesn’t regret the bath scene. “I’m thankful now, because it made me famous.”Bathgate encourage her to create a “comfort zone where I’m myself and no one affects it but me”. She started her record labels Trip (which celebrates 20 releases this month with a new compilation) and Galaxiid, which established her as a tastemaker for severe and surreal techno: the muggy, Kraftwerkian anti-anthems of Icelandic artist Bjarki Russian duo PTU and their breakneck whirls of pinging samples and Kraviz’s own releases, which sound as though they were made for the dungeon of a Detroit techno club in 1991.She still has to deal with sexist comments about her mixing skills and men leering during her live streams. “I try not to think about it, but the majority of people are maybe not that interested in music on a deep level.”As it nears 3am, I wonder how she maintains her sanity in a world of sunrise sets and constant travel. “I have a pretty serious sleeping problem,” she says. “I’m so excited I can’t go to bed for three hours after the show, no matter how tired I was before. But I cannot control it, so I just accept it.”Her schedule is about to get even more busy. There is a summer of festivals ahead, she is making remixes for art-pop musician St Vincent (“She’s a character I like characters”) and she is writing new music. “I think people are mostly attracted to the energy I bring,” she says. “And if people like my energy, that’s already the greatest compliment I could get.”The compilation album Trip 20: Don’t Mess With Cupid is released on 20 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5132f699a17a1bcddcd51984b6e631e4f0c6bd/36_487_4776_2865/master/4776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b6a9b87c04353def64f2e96cdfa9e3","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance. Yet a few places have doubled down on offering secrecy to the super-rich. Among these, one tiny Caribbean island might be the worst offender. By  Oliver BulloughTax havens hate attention. Places such as Jersey, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands made a handsome living from helping their clients break other countries’ laws for decades, without anyone really noticing. And they liked it that way. Then came the 2007-8 financial crisis, and the good times ended. Rich nations, angry over the loss to their budgets caused by tax dodging, put diplomatic pressure on the havens. Activists, furious over the theft of hundreds of billions of pounds from poor countries, exposed them in the press. The release of vast troves of confidential information – SwissLeaks, the HSBC files, the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers – cemented a public perception that offshore financial centres exist to help the powerful dodge their obligations to the rest of us, and governments have queued up to punish them. In May, when Britain’s parliament voted to force transparency on its Caribbean islands, it was just the latest blow to the offshore havens.Although cooperating with outsiders in this way has proven expensive, the havens clearly concluded there was little choice. If denied access to the global financial system, or sanctioned by Brussels or Washington, an offshore centre could be put out of business altogether.This is good. Tax havens have helped the world’s wealthiest and most powerful keep a disproportionate share of the benefits of globalisation, by preventing the rest of us from seeing how much they own. This, in turn, has eroded trust in democracy and capitalism all over the world. Restricting the operations of tax havens, and enforcing true transparency on the ownership of property, is crucial if citizens are truly to take back control of their countries’ destinies.Yet, at the heart of this increasingly encouraging picture, there remain a few holdouts – places that have stuck to the old habit of keeping the secrets of the powerful. Foremost among them is Nevis, a solitary volcano in the Caribbean with a population of just 11,000, which has been implicated in some of the most sordid financial scams of modern times, from Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud to the fleecing of 620,000 vulnerable Americans in a $220m payday loan scam. The story of Nevis reveals the difficulties the world faces in trying to put an end to tax evasion, fraud and kleptocracy.While Nevis’s rivals have lost business by opening up, Nevis has doubled down on secrecy. Not long ago, I spoke to a lawyer with extensive experience of the island, who asked not to be identified because he still needs to work with Nevisian officials. “The only good thing that Donald Trump could do, if he was ever so inclined,” he said, “is take a battleship and roll it up to Nevis, and literally train the guns and say: ‘Get rid of these bullshit laws or I’ll blow you to kingdom come.’”In short, he said, “A bright light needs to be shone on this cockroach.”Tax havens are often lumped together as if they all do the same job. In reality, they are distinctive and highly specialised predators in the financial shark tank. At the top of the food chain – as far as the western world goes, anyway – are places such as London, Switzerland and New York. These apex predators are surrounded by clouds of pilot fish that snap up the scraps: places such as Monaco, Jersey and the Cayman Islands.These smaller centres all play different aspects of the offshore game: Jersey specialises in trusts, the BVI in incorporation, Liechtenstein in foundations. They also differ in their tolerance for criminality. Among the British territories: Gibraltar is dodgier than Guernsey, but cleaner than Anguilla. And they serve different geographical regions: Mauritius for Africa and India Cyprus for the former Soviet Union the Bahamas for the US.In the world of offshore, Nevis is a bottom-feeder. It specialises in letting its clients create corporations with greater anonymity than almost anywhere else on earth. Last year, information on 70,000 Nevisian companies was leaked as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, but that didn’t help us find out who owns them: ownership information is so secret there that even the island’s own corporate registry doesn’t know. In other words, there was nothing substantial to leak.“We feel very strongly that people are entitled to some semblance of financial privacy,” the Nevis premier, Mark Brantley, himself an offshore lawyer, told me when we met in his office in January. “Why shouldn’t you be entitled to a secret?”The secrets don’t belong to residents of Nevis, of course: it would be hard to keep anything quiet for long on an island this size. The secrets belong to foreigners and are being kept from other foreigners, with Nevis getting paid to protect them.We can see that these secrets exist thanks to the UK’s Land Registry, which releases spreadsheets listing all offshore-owned property in the country, along with the registered address of the company that owns it. Some of the secrets are mundane and could be entirely innocent. For instance, who is behind Shi Li Gao Trustees Ltd, the Nevis-incorporated company that owns 13 Brunswick Gardens, a handsome terrace a short walk from Kensington Palace? Some of them are intriguing: for what reason would a Catholic primary school in Liverpool be held via this little Caribbean volcano? And some are decidedly weird: who on earth decided to structure their ownership of a room in a hotel on Llandudno’s North Parade through Caribbean Establishment LLC?But all of these questions are impossible to answer since the secrets are sealed away in Nevis. If these properties were owned via a British company, the true owner of that company would have to be declared to Companies House, and would be visible to anyone with access to the internet. If they were owned via a BVI company, that information would be available to the British police. But a Nevisian company is a closed book, and some people really like it that way.While the BVI has seen the number of companies created there each year collapse, the number created in Nevis has stayed stable. Since 2012, the island’s financial services sector has grown by more than a quarter, as people with secrets have moved to a place that still keeps them. That is a pretty good argument for Brantley’s government not to follow the BVI in opening up its corporate registries to foreigners. Secrecy pays.“The numbers are relatively small, compared to other financial services industries around, but bear in mind the size of Nevis,” Brantley said. “We get direct revenues of $5m-$5.5m, simply from renewal fees.” Renewal fees are what you pay to maintain your company’s registration the more companies there are, the more fees you get. “When that is extrapolated outwards – in terms of rental of office space, employment – we recognise that it does have a multiplier effect on the economy.”It is this provision of secrecy that makes Nevis such an obstacle to law-enforcement investigators. If police can’t prove who owns something, they can’t prove it was criminally acquired, say, or that tax was avoided on the profits from it. This is what crooks are looking for when they send their business offshore. Around 300 British properties are owned in Nevis, and Brantley was unrepentant in defending the secrecy his island provides to those properties’ owners.“Why should a bureaucrat in London, or wherever, curious about his neighbour’s financial situation, pick up the phone and say, ‘You know what, I need to know if Mr John Smith, who’s my neighbour down the road, has an account or a company in Nevis.’ Why’s that his business?” Brantley asked. “Why are Mr John Smith’s financial affairs any business of a bureaucrat in London, unless there’s an allegation against Mr John Smith that he’s somehow contravening some law somewhere?”It is an interesting philosophical question, but it is also a major problem. Countries recognise and respect each other’s laws and sovereignty, so Nevis corporations have as much international validity as anyone’s. So, as long as Nevis persists in denying foreigners access to the ownership information of its companies – no matter how hard other places work to open up – scoundrels can keep routing their business via Nevis, breaking the chain of traceable ownership, and hiding themselves and their crimes from discovery. That means crooked politicians, tax dodgers and fraudsters in Ukraine, Nigeria, Malaysia, the US or anywhere else get to mismanage their country’s finances for their own benefit.And, thanks to Nevis’s curious constitutional situation – it is neither an independent country nor can it be controlled by any other country – there doesn’t appear to be anything we can do about it.From the sea, Nevis (pronounced “knee-vis”) resembles a green nipple. It is elegantly symmetrical, a tropical volcano ringed with golden beaches. By surface area, it is roughly the same size as Bristol, yet its peak is taller than any mountain in England, so the whole island slopes upwards, starting gently where the beach bars shelter among the palm trees, then steadily steepening, while the tree cover gets denser. If you hike up the peak, you are in true rainforest, and will find yourself scrutinised by monkeys in the overhanging greenery.It is a gorgeous place, much frequented by famous people. Earlier this week, John Cleese told Newsnight he was so fed up with how Britain is run that he is moving to Nevis for good. “It’s one of the nicest islands I’ve ever been to,” he said. “The children and adults are extraordinarily well-educated, the weather’s good the whole time, I’m very lucky.”The island was once a major centre for Britain’s sugar growers and slave traders, but it slipped into obscurity in the 18th century, when it was out-competed by larger and more fertile rivals. In the 19th century, Britain added it to neighbouring St Kitts for administrative purposes, and it was as the junior half of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis that it became independent in 1983.The 80s were a bonanza period for Caribbean islands, as the global economy opened up and law enforcement was caught flat-footed. Tax evaders and drug dealers from North and South America flew planeloads of dollar bills into places such as Cayman and Anguilla, stashed them in bank accounts owned by untraceable shell companies, then invested them in property in Florida, the south of France or New York.In 1984, Bill Barnard, an American lawyer who had taken to vacationing on Nevis, asked the island’s premier if he would be interested in getting into the offshore game. Thanks to the almost complete autonomy Nevis enjoys under the federal constitution of St Kitts and Nevis, its first premier, Simeon Daniel, was free to do what he liked. He approved Barnard’s suggestion, passed the incorporation and secrecy laws the American lawyer drafted and awarded Barnard’s company, Morning Star Holdings, the right to act as exclusive agent for creating the companies. It was a win for both of them. (Neither Morning Star Holdings nor Barnard wished to comment for this piece.)At first, Nevis struggled to compete with already-established rivals, partly because it had no particular advantage of its own. Barnard and his team of American lawyers had borrowed their legislation from Delaware, which acts as a sort of tax haven within the US by offering laxer regulations and lower taxes than the other states, so there wasn’t much reason to look to a remote island for products you could already buy elsewhere. “It was certainly successful,” says David Neufeld, a New Jersey lawyer and an expert on company structuring and international tax. “But it was never at the level of BVI or Cayman.”When Barnard’s monopoly expired in 1994, Nevis took the opportunity to reboot. Neufeld already worked with Barnard, and was asked to help Nevis ersify its offering. Tax havens are always borrowing ideas from each other, seeking to improve on laws that are proving popular – and this process has led to progressively greater secrecy, fewer taxes and lighter regulations. Neufeld looked to the USnited States for inspiration, and specifically to Wyoming, which had invented the limited liability company (LLC), a useful hybrid structure that allowed people to avoid identification and taxes at the same time, as well as offering other benefits.LLCs make it hard for your creditors to find your assets, which also helps rich people avoid paying damages if they lose a lawsuit. Your creditors may have a court judgment against you, but if they can’t find your stuff, they will settle for perhaps 50 cents on the dollar to get the legal wrangling over with. Lawyers call this asset protection.But in the US, it is hard to hide property, since courts can order disclosure of information. Handily, those courts have no jurisdiction in Nevis, which made the idea of a Caribbean version of the LLC very attractive. “In my mind, I was trying to create an LLC for the 51st state,” Neufeld told me. “If you see yourself as someone who could be exposed to some kind of predatory lawsuit where people feel you have assets that are exposed, this gives you an opportunity to protect that.”In simple terms, Nevis’s laws allow rich people to put ramparts around their property, to protect it from someone who might want to use the courts to take it away, whether that be a business partner, a spouse, an estranged child, or indeed anyone. All tax havens do this, but Nevis turned the ratchet many clicks further than its rivals, in its efforts to tempt business away from its rivals.To bring legal proceedings on Nevis, you have to file a bond of $100,000 with the court as proof that your case isn’t frivolous. If you win, that is only the beginning of your quest for the assets. Nevis’s regulator holds no information on either the ownership of the company or its assets. Nevis’s LLCs – Neufeld’s innovation – can’t be wound up, meaning you won’t be able to confiscate any assets they own, and you would have to seek redress elsewhere. If you seek to challenge the legality of a property being put in a Nevis-registered trust – for example, if you thought the property actually belonged to you – you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the trust’s creation was fraudulent, and you would have to begin that legal challenge within a year of its creation. This is tricky, since Nevis law requires all information on the trust to be confidential, so you would be unlikely to know it even existed.These ludicrously formidable defences are not really intended to be used, but instead – like the bright colouring of a poisonous tree frog – they exist to warn you off attacking in the first place. If they can persuade a plaintiff to settle out of court for less than is owed, then, for a rich person with vulnerable assets, they are well worth paying for.“I don’t like the word ‘hidden’,” says Laurie Lawrence, who retired a couple of years ago after two decades as permanent secretary to the Nevis government. “It’s protected, not hidden. There’s nothing to hide. Look at it from the other way: a lot of females are gold-diggers. You are married to a man you don’t really love him, but he has money. People find ways and means to protect their assets.”This is perhaps why a wealthy person might want to own a Kensington house (or, indeed, a Llandudno hotel room) via a Nevisian company or other structure: it prevents a orced spouse, or any other creditor, from accessing that property, without a tortuous legal process. “Nevis structures started coming up about 12 years ago, and they’re coming around with increasing prevalence,” Jeffrey Fisher, one of America’s leading orce lawyers, told me by telephone from West Palm Beach in Florida.“I’m a former prosecutor, and I know about the ways people hide money, and what they’ll do,” said Fisher. “My approach to getting assets that are in asset protection entities like a Nevis LLC, is that you don’t go to Nevis and try to get the money out – that is a foolhardy enterprise. They passed laws and they set up structures to stop us and to make it expensive and to make it take years and years and years. What we do here is we use some more creative approaches to, for lack of a better term, make them cough up the dough.”Fisher’s approach is to target property and bank accounts in the US, to make his opponents’ lives so onerous that they eventually beg to settle – and he’s extremely good at it. The trouble is that anyone who cannot afford to employ highly expensive specialists such as Fisher has no prospect of even finding where their spouse has put their property, let alone wrestling a fair share away from them. They have to accept what they’re given – there’s no court that can help them.“You’ve got to realise that the asset protection industry is trillions of dollars, not billions of dollars, it’s trillions of dollars,” said Fisher. “Essentially, it’s: we’re going to find a way to screw legitimate creditors out of collecting a legitimate debt. That’s the business these people are in.”Brantley, the Nevis premier, is fluent and passionate in his defence of the ramparts that Nevis builds for rich people looking to protect their assets from creditors. “All it does is say that you’re creating a locked box, so to speak, if you want to protect assets,” Brantley said, when we met in his office up the hill from Charlestown, Nevis’s capital village. “And people protect assets for a variety of reasons. It’s not always to get away from a pending orce.”The trouble is that when you cast your eye beyond the orce cases, Nevis’s business model begins to looks even worse. The Nevis financial system is rudimentary compared to the large tax havens – places such as Jersey, or the Cayman Islands, which have major accountancy firms, fund managers, large banks and other global behemoths. In Nevis, there’s precious little money for anyone to avoid tax on. But then, it isn’t really a haven from taxes at all, so much as a haven from scrutiny of any kind. The same laws that appeal to the kind of nervous and wealthy men who want to hide their assets from their wives, have been regularly exploited by crooks from all over the world.Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud – for which five men were jailed in November, after attempting to scam the Treasury out of £107m in tax – involved Nevis-registered companies, which were helping to hide the identity of the fraudsters. The family of a former president of Taiwan used a Nevis trust to help to hide its ownership of corruptly acquired US property. Ukraine’s deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, used Nevis structures to hide his stolen assets, as did corrupt Russian officials who stole $230m from the budget in 2007. (When the accountant Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the scam, they arrested him and left him to die in jail.) British trader Navinder Sarao, who pleaded guilty to fraud for helping cause 2010’s flash crash, erted some of his profits to a Nevis structure called the NAV Sarao Milking Markets Fund.According to the independent advocacy group Tax Justice Network, Nevis out-obscures all the traditional offshore centres: BVI, Switzerland, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, and even fellow bottom-feeders such as Belize and the Cook Islands. And its enthusiasm for secrets impedes other countries’ efforts to enforce transparency.But a search of the Companies House website reveals how Nevis is able to defang Britain’s attack on secrecy. For instance, I recently came across three LLPs, all of which are owned by the same two Nevis companies: Tallberg and Uniwell. According to data gathered by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of these LLPs controlled a Latvian bank account used in a money-laundering scheme the other two have not been implicated in any wrongdoing (and neither have Tallberg and Uniwell). According to Companies House, the three LLPs have the same ownership structure, which means that their person or persons with significant control should be the same. Mysteriously, however, each of the LLPs is listed as having a different PSC. This is technically possible, but highly unlikely. But we have no way of finding out the truth, since Nevis does not cooperate with the UK in allowing law enforcement officers to see who really owns Nevisian companies such as Tallberg and Uniwell. These three LLPs are not isolated examples – Tallberg and Uniwell alone have owned dozens of British companies, and there are many more Nevisian corporations like them.The new UK law requiring disclosure of true owners is useless if that ownership can just be hidden in Nevis. And this is why Nevis-controlled but British-registered companies, whose ownership is unclear, have been involved in many of the massive eastern European money-laundering scams collectively known as the “laundromats”, which have moved tens of billions of dollars out of the former Soviet Union. Nevis ownership can transform a supposedly transparent British company into a secrecy vehicle as iniquitous as anything on earth.Charlestown is a handsome place, consisting of a long street of two-storey buildings parallel to the shore, many with first-floor balconies for catching the sea breeze. Its most striking feature, however, is the truly remarkable number of signs advertising lawyers, accountants and administrators. The Devon town of Ilfracombe, with its 11,000 inhabitants, has two lawyers’ offices, an insurance company and two sets of accountants, as well as a branch of Lloyds and a Nationwide. The 11,000 Nevisians, by contrast, host six domestic banks, one international bank, 18 insurance managers, seven international insurance entities, four money service businesses and 58 registered agents, many of them law firms. Nevis may be the most over-lawyered place on earth.When you get off the ferry, almost the first house you see is the Henville building, nominal home to the Azerbaijan first family’s business empire. If you then turn right at the T-junction, you see the Edith Solomon building (although it has lost two of the letters from its name), which hosted an Idaho payday loan company that was shut down by the state government in 2012, for operating without a license. Barely 100 metres in the opposite direction on Main Street, meanwhile, is the office of Morning Star Holdings, pioneers of the Nevis offshore industry.I was keen to find the registered address of Tallberg and Uniwell, the two Nevisian companies that had so successfully outmanoeuvred UK company law, in the – admittedly, rather forlorn – hope that I could find someone who would give me information about them. Their registered address was the same as that of the Nevis International Trust Company (NITC), which, according to its website, will supply you not only with a shell company, but also with nominee directors and shareholders, which will further obscure your involvement in it, as well as a bank account, a credit card and a stock trading account. “Nevis is an excellent location for: privacy, estate planning, asset protection, tax reduction planning, holding investments, royalty and licensing ownership,” the website states.I had an address for the NITC’s office, but no one on the island was able to tell me where it was. I spent a frustrating, hot and thirsty morning searching for it and, when I finally got through on the phone, was brushed off. “I’m not a robber,” I told the woman who answered the phone, after she had refused to help me. “I don’t know that, do I?” she replied.In fairness, she had a good reason not to talk. According to a 1985 law, anyone on Nevis disclosing financial information without a court order is liable to a prison term of up to a year, as well as a fine of $10,000. (This is another area where Nevis is resisting the trend towards openness. Cayman previously had a similar law against breaching confidentiality, but decriminalised the offence in 2016.) When I tried phoning the registered office of Tallberg and Uniwell, the receptionist refused to even tell me where the office was, so I couldn’t visit. When I emailed the NITC, there was no reply. Eventually I had to accept that it was not going to be possible to make contact with them, which meant the true ownership information for the three LLPs was undiscoverable.And it is not just journalists who are unable to check the reliability of Nevis’ financial information for themselves foreign police can’t either. That means we are all reliant on the Nevis financial services regulatory commission to do it for us. The commission is based in an office in the centre of Charlestown, and is run by Heidi-Lynn Sutton, its chief regulator, who works in an office on the first floor.Sutton started off unfriendly, and became less friendly as our 45-minute chat progressed, her manner becoming increasingly exasperated. She flatly dismissed the US state department’s description of Nevis as “a desirable location for criminals to conceal proceeds”. It was simply untrue, she said, that Nevis had anonymous bank accounts, bank secrecy and an opaque corporate register.This was odd, since her regulator’s own website states that bank account holders on the island have no obligation to provide any “statement, return or information (to) … the regulator or the minister”. However, Sutton defended Nevis against all allegations, no matter how serious. The heavy cost of bringing proceedings in Nevis court, for example, was simply to protect the justice system from being “bombarded with frivolous lawsuits”, rather than to protect the wealthy. “That is our weeding-out mechanism,” she said. “Some countries are very litigious. If you get a little burn on your hand because you spill a McDonald’s coffee, somebody will sue you.”When I explained the difficulty I had faced in even finding NITC, Sutton laughed, asking why I was looking for it. I explained that I had hoped to discover who actually owned the limited partnerships on the British registry. When I asked about whether the regulator she runs might have failed to notice a number of serious money-laundering schemes, she simply said: “I can’t speak to that, I really cannot speak to that.”What about the fact that the former ruling families of Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as lower-profile crooks from all over the world, had used Nevis vehicles to obscure the ownership of their stolen assets? Sutton laughed again. “I can’t accept that there has been multiple usage of our structures to facilitate whatever. I can’t accept hearing it from you. I won’t be able to speak to that.”If the island is so clean, why did online trolls looking to smear Emmanuel Macron before the 2017 French presidential election create fake documents supposedly showing he had a shell company in Nevis? Isn’t that a sign that the industry Sutton oversees has an image problem? “People make things up all the time,” she replied. “Once you are an international financial centre, and provide certain services, you will always be a target, it doesn’t mean that it’s true.”I have spent most of the last four years researching financial crimes, and have spoken to dozens of regulators and investigators in multiple jurisdictions, but never before had I met one who responded in such a way to allegations of grand corruption, money laundering and fraud that I was making against their jurisdiction.Like any financial centre, Nevis must choose between turning away dirty money, or attracting as much business as it can. I did not find my visit to Nevis reassuring.Since Nevisian officials appear happy with the current situation, it is up to outsiders to force change on the island, and sadly – thanks to the constitutional peculiarities of the federation – this is all but impossible. We know this because it has been tried.In 1995, in federation-wide elections, the St Kitts and Nevis Labour party swept to power with seven of the 11 federal seats, and its leader, Denzil Douglas, became prime minister. He had no seats on Nevis, but did not need any to pass laws for the whole federation. Among his priorities was restricting Nevis’ sordid financial sector. “We were aware that the international community had begun to frown upon Nevis, and on the international financial services that were poorly regulated, not supervised, etc,” said Douglas when we met in his office in Basseterre, the federal capital, which is on St Kitts. “And we sought to bring in new legislation. So they had their referendum.”In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force – a Paris-based group created by the G7 to develop policies against money-laundering – blacklisted the whole of St Kitts and Nevis, as one of 15 countries deemed to be non-cooperative. That forced Nevis to agree to federal legislation, but did not change the basic dynamic that it has significantly more autonomy than Scotland has within the UK, and in some ways more than inidual US states. One financial professional in Basseterre described the relationship between Nevis and St Kitts as like that of a teenager with access to his big brother’s credit card.None of the tools that large countries have used against tax havens such as Switzerland or Jersey – diplomatic pressure, legal proceedings against banks, and so on – are applicable to Nevis. It is part of a fully independent country (unlike the BVI or Gibraltar) and the companies providing its services (unlike the Swiss banks targeted by the US Department of Justice) are not large enough to fear losing their offices in the US.Major western countries will have to make their criticism of Nevis via diplomatic channels, if they want it to change its ways. Brantley got his retaliation in first, however, accusing the British government of hypocrisy.“It is no secret that the UK, and London in particular, has a disproportionate number of wealthy Russians, for example, and wealthy oligarchs from all around the world, and the question is: why? It can’t be for the weather. So, why are people flocking to London? So, if the United Kingdom can do that, then what is the issue with other countries, not as endowed as the UK, trying to stand on their own two feet?”The issue is that if every jurisdiction thinks only of how to stand on its own two feet – whether that’s post-Brexit Britain, Nevis or Wyoming – we will all be pushed over separately by the world’s crooks and thieves. Brantley is right that we all need to do more to fight kleptocrats and fraudsters, but by keeping their secrets and making money from it, Nevis is stopping the rest of us from moving forward.• This article was amended on 12 July 2018 to correct an error.

The European council guidelines lay down the EU’s red lines, including the insistence that the UK cannot benefit from “cherry-picking” its favourite parts of the EU rulebook.In a terse message on Twitter, Barnier said the EU had offered the UK an “ambitious” free-trade agreement and cooperation on a wide range of issues, including a “strong security partnership”. The offer of a free-trade agreement falls far short of British hopes that were finally spelt out in in detail, more than two years after the EU referendum result.Barnier said he was looking forward to further Brexit negotiations with the UK, which are due to resume on Monday. Following those talks, Barnier is due to meet ministers from the 27 EU member states on 20 July, where they will debate how to respond to the British plan. The UK proposal to create a single market in goods is likely to meet resistance in the face of the EU’s longstanding demand that there can be no-cherry picking of its internal market, nor ision of its “four freedoms” – goods, services, people and capital. “If we allow this flexibility on the single market, the whole building might crumble,” one EU source told the .The British proposals on customs, which are complex and untested, are also likely to run into trouble in Brussels. As part of an attempt to avoid a hard border on Ireland, the UK is proposing to apply EU tariffs to EU goods passing through the UK, while having the freedom to set different tariffs on goods entering the UK. In carefully chosen language, the UK is describing this unprecedented arrangement as “as if in a combined customs territory with the EU”. But EU diplomats who heard early outlines of the plan said it sounded too close to earlier proposals that were rejected last year.British officials hope the 98-page document will prompt the EU to soften its approach and put the UK into a different category to other non-EU countries such as Norway or Canada. Now the UK has diluted some of its red lines, it hopes the EU will respond in kind.The EU maintains that existing British red lines – no jurisdiction of the European court of justice, no free movement of people – mean the only option is a free-trade agreement, similar to those Brussels negotiated with Canada or Korea – a point of conflict with the UK that is subtly restated in Barnier’s tweet.So far there is no sign that the EU is ready to change its approach, but officials say they want to read the paper carefully before drawing conclusions.The British government was urged to clarify its positions on a fallback plan for preventing a hard border with Ireland, the so-called backstop, so that the Brexit withdrawal agreement “can be finalised as quickly as possible”.However, MEPs welcomed the UK government’s hint that it was seeking a Ukraine-style “association agreement” with the EU – a wide-ranging legal arrangement covering economy, security and foreign policy, which is the European parliament’s preferred option."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b568bfc492b1178dab19f2dcaa36b135907e51/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17c748efeb85f3de7b4c4b47d9c5e4e7","title":"neutrino that struck antarctica traced to galaxy 37bn light years away","story":"Discovery may solve 100-year-old puzzle of high-energy cosmic rays that occasionally hit EarthA mysterious, ghostly particle that slammed into Earth and lit up sensors buried deep beneath the south pole has been traced back to a distant galaxy that harbours an enormous spinning black hole.Astronomers detected the high-energy neutrino, a kind of subatomic particle, when it tore into the southern Indian Ocean near the coast of Antarctica and carried on until it struck an atomic nucleus in the Antarctic ice, sending more particles flying.The event, which took place on 22 September 2017, was captured by the IceCube experiment, a cubic kilometre of clear ice kitted out with sensors to detect such intergalactic incidents. Within a second of the particle being spotted, IceCube issued an automatic alert, prompting an international race to find the neutrino’s origin.Because scientists on the IceCube experiment had worked out the path the particle took through their subterranean ice instrument, astronomers knew where in the sky to look for the particle’s source. A string of early observations came up blank, but days later Nasa’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope spotted the likely source: a flaring “blazar”.Most galaxies are thought to have spinning supermassive black holes at their centres. But some of these black holes appear to pull in material at ferocious rates, a process that simultaneously sends streams of highly energetic particles out into space. Such galaxies are called blazars, although the term only applies when one of these streams is directed straight at Earth.The blazar that appears to have sent the neutrino our way lies 3.7bn light years from Earth, just off the left shoulder of the constellation of Orion. While a single detection is not strong evidence, the IceCube scientists went back through their records and found a flurry of neutrinos coming from the same spot over 150 days in 2014 and 2015. Details are published in two separate papers in the journal Science.By discovering the neutrino’s origins, astronomers may also have solved the 100-year-old puzzle of what kinds of objects can create high-energy cosmic rays that occasionally hit the planet. Cosmic rays are made up of protons and other charged particles and are almost impossible to trace to their origins because the particles are deflected by magnetic fields as they travel through space. But high-energy cosmic rays also form neutrinos, which travel in straight lines so are easier to trace back to their source.“We know that there are these very high-energy cosmic rays being accelerated out there somewhere and it’s a century-old mystery where they are coming from,” said Erik Blaufuss, who works on IceCube at the University of Maryland. “The problem with cosmic rays is that they go out into space and get scrambled.”In tracing the neutrino back to its origin, scientists have launched a new era of astronomy, one in which the heavens can be observed not only with traditional telescopes, and even gravitational wave observatories, but with neutrino detectors too. “How much we are just starting to scratch the surface is the big question we are grappling with now,” said Blaufuss.Neutrinos are extraordinary particles. So light that they were once thought to be massless, they stream continuously out from the sun in vast quantities. Most of the time they pass through objects in their path: about 100bn pass unnoticed through the area of a fingertip every second. Collisions with other particles such as that detected in Antarctica happen very rarely.Julian Osborne at the University of Leicester was part of a team that used Nasa’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to confirm the flaring blazar. “This is literally a new way of seeing the universe,” he said. “This really is the dawn of a new type of astronomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c80eb0225f103e1b0d6da802e98396385ea2963/0_316_3082_1849/master/3082.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809c0905bbd5b7b47fe366fdedee6eb9","title":"otzis last supper mummified hunters final meal revealed","story":"Scientists say iceman ate ‘horrible-tasting’ high-fat meal of ibex before his murder 5,300 years agoÖtzi the iceman filled his belly with fat before he set out on the ill-fated hunting trip that ended with his bloody death on a glacier in the eastern Alps 5,300 years ago, scientists say.The first in-depth analysis of the hunter’s stomach contents reveal that half of his last meal consisted of animal fat, primarily from a wild goat species known as the Alpine ibex.While researchers have previously studied remnants of food in Ötzi’s intestines, a more complete picture of his final feast was delayed because they could not find his stomach. It was finally located by a CT scan, tucked up under his ribcage near his shrunken lungs.“It was surprising to see this extraordinarily high-fat diet,” said Frank Maixner at the Eurac Research Institute for Mummy Studies in Bolzano, Italy. “He clearly knew that fat is a high-energy source and he really composed his diet to survive at high altitude.”Ötzi’s last meal may have fortified him for a hunting trip that lasted several days high up in the Alps, but it may not have been the most enjoyable feast. Maixner has tried ibex. He said the meat is not too bad, but struggled to find the words to encapsulate the experience of eating the animal’s subcutaneous fat. “The taste is really, well, it’s horrible,” he said. “And they had no salt at the time.”German tourists discovered the copper-age corpse in 1991 while hiking at 3,200 metres in the Ötztal Alps near the Austrian-Italian border. They thought the body, soon nicknamed Ötzi, was that of a modern mountaineer, but upon excavation the well-preserved remains were found to be more than 5,000 years old. The hunter, thought to be 45 years old when he died, was clad in a woven grass coat and wore leggings and shoes of leather. He was covered in simple line tattoos, and carried a copper axe, a knife and flint-tipped arrows.Ötzi’s body is stored at -6C to ensure the remains do not deteriorate. So to analyse his stomach contents, Maixner, part of an international team of scientists, had to partially thaw the corpse to collect samples to check for remains of his final meal.Through a combination of methods including DNA matching and microscopic inspections, the researchers found traces of red deer and ibex meat, ancient wheat and plenty of ibex fat. They also discovered multiple traces of toxic bracken, a finding that has the scientists stumped.Writing in the journal Current Biology, the researchers speculate that Ötzi may have eaten the toxic bracken to rid himself of whipworm parasites, which had been discovered in his intestines previously. But Maixner favours other explanations. Ötzi may have eaten the bracken as a food supplement, a practice known among some indigenous groups. “Another possibility is that he wrapped his dried meat in bracken leaves and some of the material got into his gut unintentionally,” Maixner said.However it got there, the toxic plant was not fatal. The discovery in 2001 that an arrowhead had shattered Ötzi’s shoulder blade suggests that events turned dark on the mountain that day. “The current thinking is that he bled out and died on the glacier,” said Maixner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/544ddf36811b254f96815749dadc1612341835a3/1705_20_2505_1503/master/2505.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad827571e329a6f7cc5d6ed9c8af16c6","title":"chris froome wada statement uci handling salbutamol case","story":"Chris Froome and Team Sky will be hoping that the lengthy statement published last night by the World Anti-Doping Agency, clarifying the circumstances around the decision to drop his salbutamol case, finally defuses the tense and fractious atmosphere around the defending Tour de France champion.Sky’s team principal, Dave Brailsford, has been pressuring both Wada and the UCI president, David Lappartient, to explain their decision more fully as the atmosphere of hostility from French fans towards Froome continues.Reacting to the statement at the stage start in Brest on Thursday morning, Froome said: “I’m happy that they have released more data and as I’ve said from the beginning I’m happy for them to do that.”Yet inconsistencies remain, which will concern those who have both the time – and energy – to trawl through the latest in a long line of statements from the UCI, Wada, and Froome’s team.Most striking is the Wada reliance on the UCI’s decision to waive a pharmacokinetic study, attempting to recreate the conditions surrounding Froome’s sample from last year’s Vuelta a España, which was not even considered worth mentioning in the UCI’s original statement issued on 2 July that cleared Froome.In contrast, Diego Ulissi of Italy was subjected to a nine-month ban after his pharmacokinetic study, following a similar adverse analytical finding on stage 11 of the 2014 Giro d’Italia, failed to convince the UCI.“I can’t speak for Ulissi but I know in my case it stopped at the explanation phase,” Froome said. “There are two phases: explanation phase and than after that, if that’s not sufficient, it goes to the pharmaceutical study. Mine stopped before it even got to that phase.”Wada stated that the UCI accepted that in Froome’s case a “pharmacokinetic study would not have provided reliable evidence.”The statement added that Wada took into account Froome’s physical condition, “which included an illness, exacerbated asthmatic symptoms, dose escalation over a short period of time, dehydration” and added that like Ulissi, Froome was “midway through a multi-day road cycling race.”But Froome was critical of the possible inequality of treatment of athletes according to financial status.“If an athlete is given a guilty sentence for his lack of funds and support then I think that’s an extremely dire situation for sport in general,” he said. “It’s not for me to say if there should be some kind of fighting fund but it would definitely help people in that position.” The Wada statement – published 20 minutes before England kicked off against Croatia in the World Cup semi-final – firmly puts responsibility for the outcome of Froome’s case at the UCI’s door, saying that “from start to finish” the UCI was “solely and exclusively in charge of the procedure and dealt with all procedural aspects of the case.”As stated by the UCI, Wada asserted that cycling’s world governing body had reached “the right and fair outcome on this very complex case”.According to the statement, the combination of Froome’s “within-subject variability for salbutamol excretion, the sudden and significant increase in salbutamol dosage prior to the doping control, and the number of consecutive doping controls meant that the analytical result could not be considered inconsistent with the ingestion of a permissible dose of inhaled salbutamol.“In the Froome case, the test was applied the same as for any other athlete by looking at the unique physiological and circumstantial details that could be clearly determined. Froome was able to show the UCI Tribunal how it was possible that he took a permitted dose of salbutamol.”According to Wada, between 2013-17, of the 41 completed cases that involved salbutamol as the only substance, 21 out of 41 resulted in suspensions. Yet only four of the 57 completed cases had been within road cycling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40f85a0704911d892ef7e507dc5e04510fd2f5a/155_95_2978_1787/master/2978.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13dd3e40c707f8c1c926c3218e730574","title":"scottish open first round golf report","story":"Phil Mickelson conceded he does a lot of “dumb stuff”, after speaking at length for the first time about his controversial penalty during the US Open.The five-times major winner was four over par for his third round at Shinnecock Hills when he badly over-hit a putt on the 13th and, seeing that it would roll off the green, prevented that from occurring by running after his ball and hitting it while it was still moving.A number of fellow professionals felt Mickelson should have been disqualified for a serious breach of etiquette, but the left-hander was given a two-shot penalty for breaking rule 14-5 and eventually finished joint 48th.Mickelson told critics of his actions to “toughen up” after claiming he was simply using the rules to his advantage, but a few days later sent a message to a handful of American journalists offering his apologies.The 48-year-old was also penalised for tapping down some long grass in front of a tee during the Greenbrier Classic last week and, speaking after an opening round of 70 in the Scottish Open, said: “I’ve had a rough month. I haven’t been my best. So I’m working at trying to fix that.“The thing about this is throughout my career, 25 years, there have been a lot of times where I have had to be accountable for decisions I did not make. And the reason why this has actually been easier is it was my own fault. The backlash is my own fault. So it’s much easier to deal with. I do a lot of dumb stuff.“I have these moments where I’m like in a cloud, if you will, I’m not really sure what I’m doing or I’m just kind of going through the motions and not really aware at the moment, and I’ve done that a bunch in my career.”Asked if his actions at the US\u0026nbspOpen were intended as a protest against the way the USGA had set up the course, Mickelson said: “There was just a bunch of stuff. But I had to let that go. It took me a few days to kind of let it go.“Not only was I not great on the course – I was not great after the round, either. So it was just not a great day, and it was my birthday. So I tend to do dumb stuff on my birthday, too.“At the time I was pretty angry. The way I show anger is not the traditionally accepted way of, you know, throwing clubs and berating the fans and marshals. I tend to be a little more passive aggressive in my actions, and that was kind of what I was doing.”Mickelson also revealed that his potential $10m (£7.5m) shootout with Tiger Woods is “close to having some stuff finalised”, but that he and Woods would not be putting up the money themselves. “I would hope for a sponsor,” he said with a smile.England’s Matthew Southgate was given plenty of encouragement during his Scottish Open first round – thanks to references to the man who took the nation’s football team to the World Cup semi-finals.“A few people were chucking out the ‘Nice shot Gareth’ but I’m not sure Gareth threads it through linksy bunkers like I do with the driver,” Southgate joked after a round containing an eagle, five birdies and two bogeys.Southgate lies one beyond the early clubhouse leaders Rickie Fowler, Robert Rock, Sebastián Fernández and Jnes Dantorp who all hit opening rounds of 66 at Gullane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/678906fe74460826e5ba341715b64cf168d789ab/0_200_4213_2528/master/4213.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5d0e3fe2260ce09613069b6e6ea77d8","title":"tour de france stage six report dan martin mur de bretagne","story":"Ireland’s Dan Martin attacked to claim stage victory on the steep finish to Mûr-de-Bretagne in the sixth stage of the 2018 Tour de France.

A single, then substitute fielder Dawid Malan (not sure who he’s on for) does very well to save a couple of runs on the cover fence from Kohli. 26th over: India 175-1 (Sharma 76, Kohli 57) - target 269 Sharma may have done himself a mischief in playing that last pull. Might have just been a spot of cramp, as the physio comes out with hydration of some description. He might be able to just stand at the other end if Kohli carries on like this, playing a beautiful delicate late cut for a boundary from the last ball of Moeen’s over. 25th over: India 169-1 (Sharma 75, Kohli 52) - target 269 Wood is the latest England bowler to attempt the futility of reeling these Indian batsmen in, and his greeted by the full face of Kohli’s bat, flashing in front of his eyes as a four is lashed to the cover fence. A half century for Kohli, and he looks like he’s having a net out there. As does Sharma, who plays a delicious ramp shot over what probably would have been third or fourth slip, getting a boundary for himself. And then, to compound the misery, to grind Wood’s nose further into the dirt, a beautiful whipped pull goes in front of fine leg for another brilliant Sharma boundary. 24th over: India 154-1 (Sharma 66, Kohli 46) - target 269 Moeen gets another try with the ball. It’s a bit difficult to tell if he kept the batsmen quiet, with just two singles from the over, or they simply decided to take a breather. 23rd over: India 152-1 (Sharma 65, Kohli 45) - target 269 Rashid is swept perfectly by Sharma behind square for another four, then collects a couple with an under-edged pull that Wood pulls in, but takes a colossal chunk out of the Trent Bridge outfield in doing so. Sharma then takes a slightly earthier approach by launching a slog over mid-on, which skips for one more boundary.22nd over: India 140-1 (Sharma 54, Kohli 44) - target 269 Sharma goes to 50 with the most careful, considered cut to the boundary that he almost took 20 minutes to ponder over it. What a brilliant player he is. 21st over: India 133-1 (Sharma 49, Kohli 42) - target 269 Kohli tries a fierce cut off Rashid but only really gets a toe-end on it, and Bairstow has to make another smart stop on the fence to keep them to two. Three other singles from the over. 20th over: India 128-1 (Sharma 48, Kohli 38) - target 269 Stokes tries a slower ball but it loops out of his hand and barely lands on the cut strip. Don’t mind the intention: it looks like the only way he’s going to get either of these batsmen out. Stokes is lucky to get away with another wide - for height, this one - but otherwise it’s a tight over, two more singles from it. 19th over: India 125-1 (Sharma 47, Kohli 37) - target 269 Rashid isn’t really getting much turn. Certainly not as much as Kuldeep did earlier. Three singles from the sort of quiet over India can afford. England really need to go all out for wickets. This isn’t going to go down among the ODI classics, unless something outrageous happens in the next hour or so. 18th over: India 122-1 (Sharma 45, Kohli 36) - target 269 Stokes replaces Plunkett as the skies grow a little darker. He nearly banjaxes Kohli with a slower ball that is driven in the air, but ultimately safely out to Root on the cover fence. Then a regulation speed ball, half-volley though it is, goes a bit straighter, wide of mid-off and to the boundary. And that will be drinks. 17th over: India 114-1 (Sharma 44, Kohli 29) - target 269 Rashid nearly gets through Kohli, an inside edge which rattles between his pads and nearly hits leg stump. Two singles and a two, nicely saved by Bairstow on the third man fence, from the over. And given autopilot is designed to guide you home with the least fuss possible, that’s very accurate. Another over with a couple of singles, then a boundary from the last ball, clipped fine by Kohli.15th over: India 104-1 (Sharma 42, Kohli 21) - target 269 It briefly looks like a good over for England, until Sharma sweeps with power but consummate control control behind square for four, off the last ball of Rashid’s over. 14th over: India 98-1 (Sharma 37, Kohli 20) - target 269  Plunkett continues, and is milked for three singles, then a very lovely two flicked through mid-wicket. Only an act of god or a collective Indian existential crisis will stop them knocking these runs off in brisk order. 13th over: India 93-1 (Sharma 35, Kohli 17) - target 269 Dilly Rashid gets a bowl, and sends down a tidy over. But these batsmen are so comfortable playing spin - even very good legspin like this - that they look in absolutely no danger. A point emphasised when Kohli ks a shortish - but not outrageously short - ball from off stump to the point fence. 12th over: India 87-1 (Sharma 34, Kohli 12) - target 269 Smart running from Kohli takes two when there should have only been one. A couple more quick singles, and really this is all India need from this point. 11th over: India 83-1 (Sharma 33, Kohli 9) - target 269 Here’s Ben Stokes with the ball, Eoin Morgan mixing things up with his attack. He gives Sharma some driving practice with a half-volley begging to be driven to the boundary, and he duly obliges. 10th over: India 74-1 (Sharma 27, Kohli 6) - target 269 Liam Plunkett is into the attack, and he does quite well. He restricts India to a couple of singles, guided down to third man by both batsmen. 9th over: India 72-1 (Sharma 26, Kohli 5) - target 269 And Virat is away in style, a lovely pushed off drive through the covers and to the boundary. A single, then Sharma adds another pair of fours with a terrific jab that threads the thin path betwixt point and third man, then a more orthodox square cut. 8th over: India 59-1 (Sharma 17, Kohli 0) - target 269 Always a funny one when you’ve got a player as brilliant as Kohli in the opposition: taking a wicket is great, but you do how have to face a genius...Lovely adjustment from Dhawan, who premeditates a sweep but, on spotting the ball was too short for the shot, instead he plays a sort of pull from one knee. Nothing lovely about the next shot: he gets giddy, runs down the track and goes for a big heave, which he only manages to thick edge and loop to Rashid in the gully. 7th over: India 53-0 (Dhawan 35, Sharma 17) - target 269 Wood continues, and is absolutely carted with a languid straight drive, which sails over mid-off for six. Remarkable shot which, as a result of it hitting concrete in the stands, requires a change of ball.6th over: India 45-0 (Dhawan 34, Sharma 10) - target 269 Spin required already, and Moeen Ali is into the attack from the Pavilion End. Sharma goes back and smacks a terrific back-foot drive to the cover fence, which combined with four simple singles, makes it a straightforward eight from that over. If they carry on like this we’ll be done by the 36th over. 5th over: India 37-0 (Dhawan 32, Sharma 4) - target 269 Another four, Dhawan this time glancing one fine as Wood falls over in his delivery stride for I think the fourth time already today. Then another, combined with a half caught \u0026amp bowled chance, hit firmly back towards the bowler, but probably too far to his left. Then another, to the same place as the first in this over, but this time from a pull he just got enough on. He’s taking the game away from England all on his own. 4th over: India 24-0 (Dhawan 19, Sharma 4) - target 269 Another buffet ball from Willey but another lovely shot from Dhawan, flicked off his pads for another boundary. England have enough problems without deliveries like that. 3rd over: India 19-0 (Dhawan 14, Sharma 4) - target 269 Wood sends a short one down the leg side, there’s a noise and Buttler goes up for the catch a little half-heartedly. Looked like it just flicked his arm guard. A couple of singles and a wide from the over. 2nd over: India 16-0 (Dhawan 13, Sharma 3) - target 269 Big Dave Willey has the ball from the other end, looking to get some early swing. Which he does, but Dhawan goes with the arc of the ball to cream a couple of cover drives to the boundary. Those two were essentially off side half-volleys, so Willey mixes things up a bit by giving Dhawan a half-volley on his pads, which is clipped to the ropes despite the best efforts of Ben Stokes. 1st over: India 3-0 (Dhawan 1, Sharma 2) - target 269 Wood starts with an absolute snorter, moving away, beating Sharma and somehow missing off stump. Two singles later Wood beats the edge again, and while he can look rather innocuous sometimes, but that was a decent first over from the Durham quick.The players are out. It’ll be Shikhar Dawan and Rohit Sharma to open the batting, and from the Radcliffe Road End Mark Wood has the ball. Well hello. This total does look rather light, but perhaps our perceptions are coloured slightly by the absurd outlier (on a different sort of pitch) that was the 481 against Australia. Still, you would expect India to knock these off without too much sweat. Your thoughts on the matter either via email - Nick.Miller.casual@the - or Twitter - @NickMiller79.

Yes please!A superb performance by Kuldeep - 23 years old and walking off with 6-25, the best figures by a spinner against England in ODI cricket, beating the record set by Sanath Jayasuriya of 6-29 in 1993. England were all at sea, trapped into indecision by his accuracy and variation,He’s got some fans too:Roy and Bairstow gave England a good start and there was another cracking innings by Buttler, then a curious one by Stokes, obviously rusty, and frustrated by his inability to thrash the ball about as is his usual want. No runs for Root, which won’t do anything for his confidence. Is it enough? It seems unlikely, unless Rashid and Moeen can turn the tables on India.49.5 overs: England 268 all out (Wood not out 0) Well, that wasn’t quite what we expected on this wicket, at this ground, where England broke the world record against Australia earlier this year. Out! Going for a ridiculous second run to deep backward- point Rashid flat-bats a low full toss to deep point. 49th over: England 259-8 ( Plunkett 1, Rashid 22) Wow! Rashid flicks Siddarth over his left shoulder for six, as if digging a children’s sandcastle, racing against the tide. And then again, if more awkwardly, for four. One over left. 48th over: England 246-8 ( Plunkett 0, Rashid 14) Moeen throws the bat, beautifully, pulling behind square for six, then a four . Then he’s out, but he had to go for it. England nearing 250 - it doesn’t look enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80cd4ac42a7bd0ceb6296954cf8895092c92c1a0/327_178_2023_1214/master/2023.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6c6079256cc4bbe8a8ee3be33fc37f0","title":"apple releases new faster macbook pro laptops","story":"Updated machines have hands-free Siri, the latest processors, True Tone displays and a quieter keyboard Apple has updated its MacBook Pro laptops with new processors, keyboards and display technology, and hands-free Siri.The update is slightly more than an expected specifications improvement for Apple’s popular “Pro” laptops.

So she’s brought that creative buzz into a multi-faceted retail space.Joining up with another clothing designer, The Grunge Monkey, Hyndman launched The 2nd Floor in Chester in April. The idea was to make it a place where people could come in to get a feel for her brand, but also where creative minds could relax and be inspired. Within it, she has set up a coffee shop, a space for artists to showcase their work and an area for local musicians to play and sell records. “We feel really passionately about what we do, but also about the creative community around us. We wanted to offer that support to other people in our position,” she says.Hyndman knows many sides of the creative industry, putting her in a good place to make the space work. Not only does she sell her own clothes, but she splits her time with her band, Campfire Social, and is a keen wakeboarder and surfer. Each summer, she travels from festival to festival, sets up shop, meets new people and sells her clothes to like-minded folk.“Part of the whole idea of the brand is going out travelling and being outdoors. I don’t want to lose that,” she says. “It’s great to have a place that reflects that.”Hyndman started Junkbox Apparel as an online clothing shop in 2013, drawing on a background in retail and her jewellery design hobby. “It came from my own interests and what I wanted in my wardrobe – leisurewear for people who enjoy the outdoors.” The name she picked out with her mum, inspired by where people tend to store their accessories, in particular their costume jewellery. “You used to call that junk jewellery, hence where Junkbox came from,” she says. “It applies to what the brand is now: you chuck your stuff in a bag and you’re off.”The idea of travelling light evolved from her days of going on holiday with a different outfit packed for each day. “I hate doing that now, but I still like to look good and I like to be comfortable.” Which is why she came up with the capsule set: a few items of clothes that centre around a similar colour palette and activity that mix and match, so they are all that is needed for a weekend away. “You chuck them in a bag and you’re done,” she says.It’s a simple concept, but growing the business has been anything but smooth sailing. Hyndman believes there is “no original idea any more” – instead, building a business means carving out a niche, getting the brand name noticed, and collaborating rather than competing. “I think that encourages you to look at what you’re doing,” she says. “Looking at the competition and making it not competition, making them your peers.”“The nice thing is, I take a little bit less along to festivals now,” she says. “I used to take a clipboard, notebook, stock sheets, and loads of things like that. The stock management side of it became a little bit of hard work. Now I just take a little box with my carrier bags, my Square Reader and then my van with as much stock as I can fit into it.”Having launched The 2nd Floor in April, Hyndman has bigger plans for Junkbox Apparel. “I want to say take over the world, but we won’t be doing that any time soon – I’ve got to be realistic,” she laughs.Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/370bdb1771209c81e9fbd8c6c803a29c119d2e51/0_192_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8166e38865a16187c5fa86796f9d94b1","title":"emmys 2018 nominations game of thrones westworld snl handmaids tale list","story":"Hit fantasy drama comes out on top, with Westworld, Saturday Night Live and The Handmaid’s Tale all followingGame of Thrones has come out in the lead in this year’s Emmys race with 22 nominations.The seventh season of the fantasy drama was recognized in the category for best drama as well as acting nominations for Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey, Diana Rigg and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.It was followed by HBO’s other major drama Westworld and long-running comedy show Saturday Night Live, which both scored 21 nominations each.

No kidding.”It is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that sets lead safety levels for drinking water utilities, although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises there is no safe amount of lead once it gets into the bloodstream. Flint’s 100,000 residents were exposed to lead leaching from old pipes after the city switched water supplies in 2014 without adding corrosion-control chemicals.The lead contamination, which has likely hindered the development of children and triggered an outbreak of legionnaire’s disease that killed a dozen people, caused international uproar and has resulted in criminal trials for several city and state officials.Flint is in the process of replacing all of its old lead water pipes, a task the city estimates will cost about $55m. Residents have been provided with water filters and, until April, were also given free bottled water.State officials have said that Flint’s water is now safe to drink, although this assurance has been met with deep skepticism among many residents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b777759f906b5bae8aaad93e95a98f7a564a6a/13_98_1222_733/master/1222.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9572027ef7f2b27576abf2826b46f031","title":"archaeologists open huge granite sarcophagus alexandria egypt","story":"Untouched for millennia, tomb was found during construction work in AlexandriaArchaeologists are preparing to open a large black granite sarcophagus unearthed in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.At almost two metres high and three metres in length, the sarcophagus is the largest of its kind to be discovered intact in the ancient city. It was found alongside a large alabaster head believed to represent the inhabitant of the tomb, which had remained untouched for thousands of years. The sarcophagus, discovered during construction work, has become a source of excitement for archaeologists because a layer of mortar between the body and the lid indicates its contents have lain undisturbed since it was buried.It is believed to be from the early Ptolemaic period, which began after the death of Alexander the Great in 323BC. “We are hoping this tomb may belong to one of the high dignitaries of the period,” said Ayman Ashmawy, the head of ancient Egyptian artefacts at the Egypt’s ministry of antiquities. “The alabaster head is likely that of a nobleman in Alexandria. When we open the sarcophagus, we hope to find objects inside that are intact, which will help us to identify this person and their position.” But opening it for the first time will require extensive work to be done in advance. “It’s risky to open it directly – we need to prepare,” said Ashmawy, explaining that the sarcophagus would be opened on site. In the coming weeks, a team of engineers will visit the site to provide heavy lifting equipment and structural supports to allow archeologists to remove the sarcophagus lid. Once inside, mummification and restoration specialists will be on hand to ensure the contents, exposed for the first time in millennia, are preserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09299ca7e9a3d56d9c4236cf8129c4ac76feae4b/188_298_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9b72f21f5bd0def202d520336e0044","title":"lancashire council bans non stunned halal meat from schools","story":"Move is Islamophobic, antisemitic and undemocratic, say Muslim leadersA council has banned meat from animals that haven’t been stunned from coucil-supplied school meals, prompting accusations of Islamophobia and antisemitism.Lancashire county council voted on Thursday to stop providing halal meat to council establishments unless animals are stunned before they are slaughtered.Nine out of 10 Muslims who responded were against the move, believing that stunning animals before they are killed is unislamic. The Board of Deputies of British Jews also opposed the proposal, saying that stunning could go wrong and lead to animals drowning or being gassed or electrocuted.The National Secular Society supported the ban. Stephen Evans, its chief executive, welcomed the result of Thursday’s vote, saying: “It’s reassuring to see Lancashire councillors voting to pursue the Council’s ethical policy on the provision of halal meat in schools, and facing down orchestrated efforts to ensure school meals in the county comply with a hardline interpretation of Islam.“Under this policy halal meat will still be supplied to meet the dietary preferences of pupils from Muslim backgrounds, but will be from animals slaughtered humanely, and in accordance with animal welfare standards. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to everyone.”Unstunned halal meat is provided in school meals for some of the 12,000 children in 27 Lancashire schools. This will now stop from September, despite the council admitting there is currently no demand for stunned halal meat from any school in the county. Lancashire Council of Mosques (LCM) described the decision as “undemocratic and hugely discriminatory. It said it was considering legal action and a boycott of council-operated catering services – a move which the council itself estimates could cost £285,000 in lost revenue.“What we see is that the people have spoken, they have opposed the proposal and they have still made this decision which is undemocratic and hugely discriminatory,” said Abdul Hamid Qureshi, the organisation’s CEO.“It could be categorised as Islamophobic, it could be categorised as a racist approach — not only Islamophobic but antisemitic as well... It’s not sensible action but offensive action to me,” he said. He said the decision showed the council was determined to bring in the ban “by hook or by crook”.Qureshi said he was worried that other councils would follow Lancashire’s lead, discriminating against Muslims around the UK.The four-week consultation exercise was carried out after LCM applied for a judicial review of the ban, which the council originally passed last year. Geoff Driver, the leader of Lancashire county council, said the decision was taken on the grounds of animal welfare: “I’m grateful to the many people who have taken the time to respond to the consultation. It has confirmed that people have strong views on this issue from a number of different perspectives, and provides a useful guide as to how people whose children receive halal school meals may respond to the decision which cabinet has taken. “We accept that a small number of schools may choose to use different suppliers for halal meat, however we hope that people understand how the council has arrived at this decision, which has been taken solely on the grounds of animal welfare with due consideration for the impacts outlined in the responses to the consultation. “We would like to work with the Lancashire Council of Mosques to ensure that the meals we supply to the affected schools in future provide a range of nutritious options which satisfy students’ dietary requirements and are acceptable to LCM, parents and governors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05b284d1fabe3f68eb080b344bae5e4d1865524d/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb83801df6db07abe27277d22729d78","title":"nato summit world leaders gather in pictures","story":"Donald Trump and Theresa May pose with other world leaders for traditional ‘family’ photographs at Nato’s Brussels headquarters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561691.1531327826!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"metro plans set to be redrawn following political opposition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEoghan Murphy: “I can confirm that the NTA and TII are looking seriously at alternative options that will not see the community segregated.” Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe National Transport Authority (NTA) is expected to redraw plans for the new link rail line following political opposition to the closure of a road linking Ranelagh and Rathmines in south Dublin.The NTA had come under significant pressure from senior politicians, including Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, to scrap plans to close the level crossing at the current Beechwood Luas stop.The closure of the through-road from Dunville Avenue to Beechwood Road would force motorists into a 1.2km detour through Ranelagh village and some of the worst traffic bottlenecks in the south of the city.The NTA last March revealed the preferred route for the new rail line, due to open in 2027, that will run every two minutes from Swords to Sandyford, serving Dublin Airport and the city centre.The 26km route, 12km of which will be underground, will combine the previously planned  North from Swords to the city centre, with an upgrade of the Luas Green line between Charlemont and Sandyford to carry the  on a fully segregated line.South of Charlemont the line will, as with the current Luas line, run above ground, but to achieve the segregation needed to ensure the faster journey times, three level crossings have to be closed to traffic.At the southern end of the line, trams and traffic intersect at the Stillorgan stop at St Raphaela’s Road, which feeds into the Sandyford industrial estate. This road “cannot be permanently closed” the NTA said so it plans to run the track on a new bridge.Closer to city, there is a level crossing at the back entrance to Alexandra College secondary school in Milltown at Richmond Avenue South. The NTA plans to close this crossing to vehicles, with pedestrians using a footbrigdelift at the Miltown stop to access the school. The closure will have no effect on access to the school from Milltown Road.At the Dunville Avenue level crossing next to the Beechwood Luas stop the NTA had said it would be “necessary to permanently close this junction to all traffic”.However, this last proposal met strenuous opposition, with almost 30 residents groups, in addition to inidual residents and local politicians, opposing the closure.In a submission to the NTA last May, Mr Murphy said he had “serious concerns” about the route with traffic being “unworkable” east of the Luas stop as people were “forced” through Ranelagh village.Mr Murphy said he has since raised the matter with Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and in recent weeks has met directly with the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).“I can confirm that the NTA and TII are looking seriously at alternative options that will not see the community segregated,” he said. “That is, new proposals that will see both cars and people being able to continue to cross the line at Beechwood.”It is understood the NTA is looking at options including an underpass for cars, or elevating the track on a bridge. A bridge was previously located at this point but was removed in 2003 to be replaced by the level crossing, ahead of the opening of the Luas line.A spokesman for the NTA confirmed it would publish a report at the end of next month identifying “any amendments to the Link proposals arising from the public consultation process. This will be followed by a short round of public consultation on any changes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Kathleen Chada says she would like to see independent homocide reviewsCork-born Michael Ring suffered injuries when two men entered his home of 53 yearsReview under way into role and payments for elected members of local authoritiesPair talk of \u0026lsquolong and harrowing process\u0026rsquoMichael Kaiser (24) sentenced to additional 18 months in prison for assault and burglaryStamps on religious topics \u0026lsquoalways really popular with those attending events\u0026rsquoCourt advises further legal measures to ensure regularisation of the adoptionSr Stan says society invited to see homeless people as \u0026lsquoother\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoundeserving\u0026rsquoPaul Bradley (54) acquitted of murder, while sons Jason (20) and Dean (24) guiltyProtestant Minister says Ireland doesn\u0026rsquot need visit from the Pope but from Holy SpiritParties get funding for each TD and senator, while Independents get inidual grantsTunnel through Ranelagh \u0026lsquoobvious solution\u0026rsquo, says Labour\u0026rsquos Kevin HumphreysJudge calls crash a \u0026lsquomost appalling tragedy\u0026rsquoAaron Connolly (18) appeared before Judge Dermot Simms at Cloverhill District CourtWoman lodged formal complaint of bullying against priestDefendant remanded in custody and could be sentenced to life in prison later this monthFormer director of Temple Bar Properties was also involved with the \u0026lsquoBertie Bowl\u0026rsquoIrish ambassador Alison Kelly summoned to foreign ministry over \u0026lsquopopulist\u0026rsquo initiativeInquest hears mechanism of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis not really understood"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3562994.1531411169!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there must be no irish language act orange order insists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBandsmen and Orange order members take part in the annual Twelfth of July celebrations in Belfast city centre. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere must be no legislative concession on the Irish language, thousands of Orangemen and women and their supporters were told on Thursday at Twelfth of July demonstrations throughout Northern Ireland.

Such a move would have far reaching detrimental consequences for our British identity and would rightly be acknowledged as a landmark victory for republicanism in their ongoing cultural war against our community.”The resolution also noted “with despair, the recent abortion referendum in the Republic of Ireland, and encourage our own government to resist any attempts to change the law in Northern Ireland”. At the Newcastle, Co Down parade the grand secretary of the order, the Rev Mervyn Gibson spoke of the need for the institution to adopt “new thinking new tactics and new alliances” in order to remain “relevant”. Mr Gibson said the principles and message of the order remained the same “but how we defend and promote them needs to be made fit for purpose in a world that would be unrecognisable to our fathers and mothers, let alone our grandfathers and grandmothers”. “Equally, there is to be no compromise on our cherished position within the United Kingdom, ” he said. “Nationalists and republicans seek to use border polls and Brexit to worry us into a united Ireland. Well, they couldn’t murder us, bomb us, intimidate us into a united Ireland – they are certainly not going to bribe us, cajole us or frighten us into a united Ireland.”The order’s grand master Edward Stevenson, speaking at the demonstration in Castlederg, Co Tyrone, said as an institution that lost 336 people during the Troubles it was vital the voice of the organisation continued to be heard.He said, “Republicans are daily attempting to rewrite history to make it look as if their campaign of murder was somehow justified. We will never allow the perpetrators of violence to become the victims, and that would be an insult to those who lost their lives and to their families.”The order’s grand chaplain, Rev Alistair Smyth, speaking in Rasharkin, Co Antrim, said “the United Kingdom as a whole is increasingly becoming a cold house for Bible believing Christians”. “In view of the decline in Biblical Christianity in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, what this island needs is not a visit from the Pope but a visit of God’s Holy Spirit,” he said. The order’s deputy grand master Harold Henning, speaking in Donaghcloney, Co Down said it was right to “cultivate good relations with our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland…but let no one confuse talking over the fence with taking away the fence”.“We recognise a sizeable minority of those who live in Northern Ireland seek a united Ireland, as is their democratic right in a free society,” he added. “Let us also recognise that the vast majority of them had no truck with, and were rightly ashamed of those republicans, who engaged in a sickening murderous campaign against their Protestant neighbours, whether in or out of uniform.”Derek Reaney, the order’s assistant grand master speaking in Garvagh, Co Derry said Brexit posed a “massive challenge to the future unity and economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom”. He added, “Any attempt to create any political, economic, or cultural barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom must be opposed. A semi-detached union is totally unacceptable.”Another grand chaplain, Rev Ron Johnstone in Newtownards, Co Down, said King William’s victory at the Battle of the Boyne “cemented liberties” that all citizens can enjoy - “freedom of speech, freedom of worship, an independent judiciary and a freely elected parliament”.Mr Smyth concluded his speech: “We declare today this is our culture. It is not intended to offend anyone. It is part of who we are. Get over it.”Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister told the Independent Orange Order demonstration in Broughshane, Co Antrim, that as presently configured Stormont could never succeed because “Sinn Féin is not there to make Northern Ireland work”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3561957.1531350564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord meghan and harry dazzle under terms and conditions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle with  President Michael Higgins  and his wife, Sabina, with  Bród and Siodá, Michael D’s Bernese Mountain dogs. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhat about this handsome couple, with their good hair, smiling eyes and lovely manners?Gorgeous and utterly charming, a winning combination of impeccable breeding and lustrous celebrity. They won, and they melted, many hearts. They have to dazzle, because it is part of the terms and conditions for working royals on walkabout duty. The royal rambles were in Trinity College and at the CHQ venue in Dublin’s Docklands, where the celebrity drawing power of the newly wed Prince and American actress unleashed waves of unbridled enthusiasm and exaltation among the crowds who came along to have a good look at them. Their day began in Áras an Uachtaráin, a short distance from Farmleigh House where they lodged the night before. President Higgins and his wife, Sabina, bustled into the State reception room to greet them, a spray of pink-tinged white roses on the mantelpiece behind them and the visitors’ book open on a small table commissioned for the visit of Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, in 2011. Outside, staff raked and reraked the gravel paths, and Bród and Siodá, Michael D’s Bernese Mountain dogs, lumbered lazily around the geraniums and fountains.“You’re most welcome,” smiled the President, greeting his guests. Meghan was toting a very large black handbag which cost thousands of pounds. Everyone reckoned she didn’t have anything in it, apart from a bit of lipstick and an emergency sliver of lettuce. According to Harper’s Bazaar, it was a Fendi bag, but that doesn’t really matter because apparently whenever she carries a new bag and the photographs appear, they sell out in a matter of hours. We’ll all just have to wait for the new order to come in. The two couples made polite conversation for the cameras and nobody in the heaving media contingent uttered a word because of protocol until Newstalk’s Henry McKean roared a question to the immeasurable relief of everyone else. There was only one question on Wednesday. “Is football coming home?” Michael D smiled and remained silent but, with England’s World Cup semi-final just hours away, the Duke couldn’t resist replying. “Most definitely!” he declared, and everyone in the room laughed uproariously and went weak at the knees.The group enjoyed a potter around the gardens and the royals rang the Peace Bell. Then came the news that everyone wanted to hear. “They met the dogs.” Or the “first dogs”.Staff from the Áras came out to witness the departure. When the presidential couple and the royal couple tried to gracefully exit the main doors, the two dogs barged their way past with not a care for status or office. Then Harry and Meghan had a final few words with their hosts – “Absolutely lovely” said Sabina – before waving farewell to Bród and Siodhá.Did the President, who announced on Tuesday he will be seeking a second term, say “this is not goodbye, but merely au revoir?” On the way to Trinity College, hugely important questions had to be teased out. What colour was the dress? Mushroom, stone, taupe? But there was clearly just a single ruffle and it was definitely cocktail length. Another fact had to be nailed down by the royal reporters. “Did she actually wave to the dog? Did she?” She did. “And the dog waved back,” snapped an RTÉ cameraman, rolling his eyes.People were anxious about the visit to Trinity. The Duchess was wearing very high heels. Could she cope on the cobbles? She nearly tripped on a very low step leaving the Áras and Michael D had to reach out a steadying hand. “She will be walking from The Long Hall,” declared an American journalist. We didn’t tell him this was the name of a nearby public house because people were worried enough. Finally, after viewing the ancient manuscript in Trinity’s Long Room, the couple emerged to delighted screams of welcome and a forest of upheld phones. Megan gingerly picked her way across the cobblestones. The international TV journalists got to work as the walkabout unfolded behind them. Ireland’s “long and troubled past” got a big airing but the royal visit was a “positive sign of improved relations between the two countries”. Strangers could be forgiven for thinking we were at war with some of the things being said. “Harreee! Harreee!” came the cries. “Meghan! Meghan! Over here!” The couple got stuck in, covering more space than Dulux, shaking hands, chatting, looking very interested, asking friendly questions, saying nice things. When the couple left, tourists and locals alike were buzzing with excitement. “There’s hardly a pick on Meghan but she’s perfectly proportioned,” said one woman. “Harry’s photographs don’t do him justice at all. He’s very handsome,” remarked Una O’Neill, a retired teacher from Templeogue. Beside her, student and top basketball player Chloe Mullins (19) held a framed black and white drawing she did of the couple’s engagement photograph. Harry stopped immediately when he saw it. “Is that for me? Wow!” He showed Meghan the picture, then said to Chloe: “You’ve given me more hair than I have.” He kept the gift, although Kensington Palace officials had gone around the crowd earlier saying they would not be accepting gifts.Then the visitors and their entourage broke for lunch at Delahunt restaurant on Camden Street to fortify themselves for the next leg – a trip to see the famine memorial on the Liffey quayside. Then they were introduced to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe who said “thank you very much” to the royals for gracing his Dublin Central Constituency, along with the Epic emigration museum in the CHQ. Yet again, the crowd was thrilled to see them in the flesh. “Today is all about Harry – Windsor, Maguire, Kane” read a poster held high by London-born Melissa Moloney. Maguire and Kane would be playing later for England. Eight-year-old Ayana O’Callaghan from Clontarf in Dublin gave her opinion on Meghan. “I think she’s pretty but she shouldn’t have to wear tights because her skin is really nice.” But it wasn’t all fun and happiness among the selfie-sticks, delirious tourists and screaming girls. “Daddy, I touched both of them,” said a breathless Twinkle Polgolla (12) from Park West to her dad. “I felt special.” Her sisters Nikishi and Tharu were equally excited because they too shook a royal hand. But their sister June (14) was inconsolable, tears falling down her face. “She didn’t make it. They moved on,” explained her mum.

Events such as choral evensong have been credited with attracting young people back to cathedrals in cities.   digitalservices@telegraphChurch of EnglandAn atheist church-goer might sound like a contradiction in terms.But experts say the results of a new survey suggest millennials and Generation Z are visiting churches for peace and quiet - even if they don\u0027t believe in God. The research found that 30 per cent of 18 to 34 year olds say they go to church, with the majority saying they go once or twice a year. The figures also place 18 to 24 year-olds above every other generation in terms of visiting church, with one in three saying they go, compared to 31 per cent of over-65s and 22 per cent of those aged 45 to 54, the lowest proportion of any age group. Research carried out by ComRes in a survey of more than 4,000 adults also found that one in five 18 to 24 year olds and one in six 25 to 34 year-olds say they go to church once or twice a year. Dr Krish Kandiah, a theologian and author who commissioned the survey, said churches and cathedrals were attractive to young people looking for a quiet sacred space. Events such as choral evensong have been credited with attracting young people back to cathedrals in cities. Cathedrals are going through the roof, I was speaking to one of the canons at Westminster Abbey, they\u0027re expecting 1.5m people through this summer.

It\u0027s seen as a safe place to collect your thoughts.Simon Oliver, Van Mildert professor of inity at the University of Durham, said the city\u0027s cathedral offered an open and non-threatening welcome to students. Our students find that to be a different experience to youth culture in many ways. We don\u0027t try and repeat back to them the culture that they live with in 2018, he said. The churches are addressing basic moral and existential questions that are very important for people in their late teens and early twenties - questions about identity, meaning of life and vocation. We are addressing them in a way that they are not addressed in the current education system.The figures contrast with data presented to the Church of England\u0027s General Synod, which heard on Monday that 81-year-olds were eight times more likely to be going to church than 18-year-olds. Dr Kandiah, whose book Faitheism addresses the relationship between Christianity and atheism, said young people were also likely to be going to non-traditional settings for church, including festivals such as Soul Survivor and modern churches such as Gas Street in Birmingham. Maybe the general public\u0027s perception of what church looks like and who\u0027d be interested is now dated, he added. Church of EnglandSpike in migrant drownings in Mediterranean blamed on tough new approach by Italy and EUDonald Trump releases \u0026#39very nice\u0026#39 letter he received from Kim Jong-un boasting of \u0026#39epochal\u0026#39 progress in talksComment: At last MPs got to ask about Theresa May’s Brexit plan.

The Government has already separately cleared Comcast\u0027s bid for Sky.Mr Wright\u0027s predecessor Matt Hancock said last month that Fox\u0027s proposal to sell Sky News to Walt Disney co, or to an alternative buyer, was likely to be the best remedy to assuage concerns about the extent of Mr Murdoch\u0027s influence over the media in Britain.Expressing anger at the decision Clive Lewis, a Labour frontbencher, said: “Understand this for what it is: elites retrenching and digging in for the fight ahead.“This is a government unashamedly fighting for corporate power and oligarchs aka the one per cent.”Under its plans to appease Government concerns, Fox has pledged to offload Sky News to Walt Disney, which is separately bidding to buy a major chunk of Fox assets - including the Sky stake.Fox has also vowed to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least £100 million a year for 15 years.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The state\u0027s\u0026nbspDepartment of Environmental Quality has said that the water is clean enough to drink – but the problem will not be fixed until the city\u0027s pipes are replaced, and residents have been advised to keep using filters or drink bottled water.Since then, many critics of Mr Musk have taken to reminding him of the problem and the possibility he could fix it on Twitter. One of those reminders appears to have finally worked, after a post that goaded Mr Musk into helping.Hey Elon Musk I heard a bunch of people saying there\u0027s NO WAY you could help get clean water to Flint, Michigan, wrote one Twitter user.\u0026nbspSaid you wouldn\u0027t be capable idk.Mr Musk almost immediately replied to the taunt.Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels, he posted.\u0026nbspNo kidding.Mr Musk\u0027s reference to the\u0026nbspFood and Drug Administration is not strictly correct: though bottled water is regulated by the FDA, public tap water is supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency.He then went on to explain in other tweets that he would pay for water filters for all houses that were able to show their water was unclean. And in the long-term he would help with other projects.He also promised to try and help resolve a breakdown in trust between the authorities and residents in Flint, as well as organise a barnstorming event during which filters would be added to Flint houses that don\u0027t have access to clean water.Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in government test results, he wrote.\u0026nbspSome houses are still outliers. Will organise a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues \u0026amp hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Still, the runaway success in terms of the acting department is far and away The Handmaid\u0027s Tale which is looking to capitalise on its big win last year.Elisabeth Moss faces the likes of Claire Foy\u0026nbsp(The Crown), Keri Russell (The Americans) and Killing Eve\u0027s Sandra Oh who becomes the first Asian woman to ever be nominated in the lead actress category while co-stars turn competitors in the categories of Supporting Actress and Outstanding Guest Actress (the former sees nominations for Alexis Biedel, Yvonne Strahovski and reigning champion Ann Dowd).In the comedy stakes, it\u0027s nominations a-plenty for the second season of Donald Glover\u0027s Atlanta, Netflix smash GLOW and Amazon\u0027s Golden Globe-winning The Marvellous Mrs Maisel which sees Rachel Brosnahan\u0026nbspgo up against Pamela Adlon\u0026nbsp(Better Things), Allison Janney\u0026nbsp(Mom) and Issa Rae of Insecure fame.Twin Peaks fans won\u0027t be happy when they see the Limited Series nominations.

And just like that detection, it relied on scientists spotting the tiniest disturbance down on Earth and tracking it down to a mysterious black hole billions of light years away.The neutrino is the first of its kind ever detected and its origin was tracked down to a likely source known as a blazar four billion light-years away. There, it was thrown out by a galaxy with a vast black hole at its centre, flung across the universe as the black hole consumes matter.Scientists have been mystified by cosmic rays since they were found more than a century ago, which pour down onto Earth and can endanger people from Earth. Despite their huge number and intense power, it has been unclear where they have come from.Now the new discovery could finally explain where they are making their way from. And it is a fittingly spectacular phenomenon deep in the universe.The neutrinos appear to be spewing out of fast-spinning supermassive black holes.The discovery could give us an entirely new way of looking at the universe. The particles might be a third messenger that carries energy from elsewhere in the cosmos, in addition to light and recently discovered gravitational waves.It will be an unprecedented new ways of understanding some of the most intense and mysterious phenomena in the universe. Neutrinos could be doubly helpful because they have no mass and travel in an almost entirely straight line through the universe – which makes them very difficult to detect but very easy to track as they travel billions of light years through the universe.Neutrinos rarely interact with matter, said Professor Paul O\u0027Brien, a member of the international team of astronomers from the University of Leicester. To detect them at all from the cosmos is amazing, but to have a possible source identified is a triumph.This result will allow us to study the most distant, powerful energy sources in the universe in a completely new way.The discovery was reported in two new papers published in the journal Science, and was the result of work by a global team of huge numbers of researchers.These intriguing results also represent the remarkable culmination of thousands of human years of intensive activities by the IceCube Collaboration to bring the dream of neutrino astronomy to reality, says Darren Grant, a professor of physics at the University of Alberta and the spokesperson of the IceCube Collaboration, an international team with over 300 scientists in 12 countries.The neutrino was found on September 22 last year by the IceCube observatory, a huge facility sunk a mile beneath the South Pole.Here, a grid of more than 5,000 super-sensitive sensors picked up the characteristic blue Cherenkov light emitted as the neutrino interacted with the ice.Having almost no mass and passing right through planets, stars and anything else in its way, the particle travelled in a straight line from its point of origin to Earth.As a result, astronomers were able to track its trajectory back across billions of light years to its probable source.News of the detection sent astronomers into a frenzy of activity as telescopes were quickly pointed in the suggested direction. The search led to a blazar, a special class of galaxy containing a supermassive black hole four billion light years away just left of the constellation Orion.The finding was the result of a global effort to track down the source, which was triggered by an automated alert after the intriguing detection at the South Pole.This result really highlights the importance of taking a multimessenger approach to these searches, said Erik Blaufuss, a research scientist in the UMD Department of Physics who led the effort over the past several years to create and deploy IceCube\u0027s high-energy event alert system. Any one observation made alone would likely not have let us piece together what is actually going on inside this source.A key feature of blazars is twin jets of light and elementary particles that shoot from the poles of the swirling whirlwind of material surrounding the black hole. One of those jets happened to point towards Earth and lead to one of the most profound discoveries in the history of astrophysics.The neutrino detected by IceCube is thought to have been created by high-energy cosmic rays from the jets interacting with nearby material.Unlike high energy neutrinos, most cosmic rays carry an electric charge that causes their trajectories to be warped by magnetic fields, making it impossible to trace their origins. In contrast neutrinos are unaffected by even the most powerful magnetic fields.The blazar believed to have generated the neutrino, code-named TXS 0506 + 056, was located in less than a minute after the IceCube team relayed co-ordinates for follow-up observations to telescopes worldwide.Being able to detect high energy neutrinos will provide yet another window on the universe, said the scientists.The sensational discovery of the second messenger, gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time, was announced in February 2016.France Cordova, director of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) that manages the IceCube laboratory, said: The era of multi-messenger astrophysics is here.Each messenger, from electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves and now neutrinos, gives us a more complete understanding of the universe and important new insights into the most powerful objects and events in the sky.Cosmic rays were discovered in 1912 by physicist Victor Hess using instruments on a balloon flight.Later research showed them to be made up of protons, electrons or atomic nuclei accelerated to speeds approaching that of light.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Government has already separately cleared Comcast\u0027s bid for Sky.Mr Wright\u0027s predecessor Matt Hancock said last month that Fox\u0027s proposal to sell Sky News to Walt Disney co, or to an alternative buyer, was likely to be the best remedy to assuage concerns about the extent of Mr Murdoch\u0027s influence over the media in Britain.Expressing anger at the decision Clive Lewis, a Labour frontbencher, said: “Understand this for what it is: elites retrenching and digging in for the fight ahead.“This is a government unashamedly fighting for corporate power and oligarchs aka the one per cent.”Under its plans to appease Government concerns, Fox has pledged to offload Sky News to Walt Disney, which is separately bidding to buy a major chunk of Fox assets - including the Sky stake.Fox has also vowed to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least £100 million a year for 15 years.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

outlines\u0026nbspof previously hidden remains before the rain makes them disappear againClick to followThe Independent OnlineHow the current heatwave is providing unprecedented opportunities for archaeologistsThe current heatwave is providing a near-unprecedented bonanza for archaeologists,\u0026nbspas scorched conditions all over Britain expose the previously undiscovered or long-hidden outlines of everything from ancient fortifications to remnants of the\u0026nbspSecond World War.\u0026nbspIn what was described as “a frantic race against time and weather”, archaeologists are scrambling into aeroplanes or flying drones to search for the outlines\u0026nbspwhich are visible from the air as “crop marks”, before they are once more erased by rain.In Wales\u0026nbspalone the new discoveries have included an early medieval cemetery in south Gwynedd, a Roman villa in the Vale of Glamorgan, a prehistoric or Roman farm near Newport and a Roman fortlet near Magor, south Wales.Members of the public are spotting the signs of everything from Bronze Age burial grounds in their local park\u0026nbspto long-forgotten Second World War air raid shelters in back gardens and schools.And for the professionals, something akin to archaeological gold-rush fever has set in.“It’s hugely exciting,” said Louise Barker, a senior archaeological investigator at the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales (RCAHMW).\u0026nbsp“There have been whole new discoveries, covering all periods of time. \u0026nbsp“Our senior aerial investigator Dr Toby Driver is flying all over Wales, going over landscapes and saying, ‘Oh my goodness, there is something I never expected down there.’\u0026nbspHe says so much new archaeology is showing it is incredible.“There probably hasn’t been anything like this for more than 40 years.\u0026nbspIt is pretty spectacular.” \u0026nbspHistoric sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe

and the hottest June on record, a remarkable number of crop marks have appeared, sometimes showing the presence of buried remains that have lain unnoticed for decades or, in the case of the new discoveries, for centuries.Langstone, Newport, south Wales (RCAHMWSWNS)In hot weather, crop marks expose the presence of things like historic buildings or burial mounds\u0026nbspbecause the grass or crops above them grow differently compared to plants in the surrounding soil.A buried ditch that once ringed a\u0026nbsphill fort\u0026nbspwill collect more underground water and nutrients, so the plants above it will grow taller and greener while the hot weather parches all the neighbouring vegetation.\u0026nbspThe underground remains of a wall, meanwhile, will have drier and poorer soil above it, producing shorter and browner plants.Ms Barker explained that the differences are more noticeable in the kind of prolonged hot weather that can affect even normally hardy greenery like grass.\u0026nbspWhich means that when the rain comes, the crop marks vanish again. \u0026nbsp“It’s a frantic race against time and the weather,” said Ms Barker.\u0026nbsp“There is just this window of opportunity, and then, according to the forecast, in the next couple of days the rain will come and it will all be lost again – the outlines will start disappearing before your eyes.”But even though the rain is coming, Ms Barker said the discoveries already made would produce great advances in archaeological knowledge, once the aerial images had been examined and the newly discovered features had been investigated at ground level.fortlet whose remains have lain hidden beneath a field near Magor, south Wales, for centuries (RCAHMWSWNS)She said: “We have found a Roman fortlet which will allow us to learn more about where the garrisons were and how the Roman conquest progressed.\u0026nbspWe have found an early medieval cemetery from maybe the eighth or ninth century, with the potential to tell us more about the period that used to be called the Dark Ages. \u0026nbsp“At the known sites, we have seen more and more things come out as it has got drier and drier.”Elsewhere in the UK, emerging crop marks have given archaeologists another look at the outlines of Venta Icenorum, the Romano-British predecessor of Norwich, which was first discovered when the RAF aeroplanes flew over it in the summer of 1928.Gawthorpe\u0026nbspHall (Lancashire CouncilSWNS)The heat has also allowed the outlines of a “ghost garden” to emerge at Gawthorpe Hall near Burnley, Lancashire. \u0026nbspDesigned by Sir Charles Barry in the 1850s, the garden was covered up after the Second World War.\u0026nbspNow the exceptionally hot weather has allowed National Trust staff to see previously unnoticed features that may actually be from gardens that predated the work of Sir Charles, at a site which has been built on since the 14th century.Long-lost North American Viking settlement was in CanadaBin lorry melts into road as hottest day of year forecast for UKMs Barker said: “The heat has allowed us to do things over a huge area and in a time frame that no amount of digging or ground radar surveys could have achieved, unless you had an unlimited budget and were willing to go slightly mad prospecting in hundreds of farmers’ fields on a hunch or nothing.“I think it will add a huge amount to our knowledge.”The heatwave has also allowed the public to discover their own crop marks revealing everything from wartime Anderson shelters to Bronze Age cremation sites.The result has been a widespread sharing of discoveries on social media.So far, however, some accounts of what has supposedly been discovered appear more optimistic than accurate.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register

That is the extent to which our lives are intermeshed with the lives of our European partners,\u0027\u0026nbspformer attorney general saysClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit debate: Britain facing \u0027state of emergency\u0027 if no deal reached, Dominic Grieve warnsBritain will face a “state of emergency” if no Brexit deal is reached by February, Dominic Grieve has warned\u0026nbspat an exclusive event for Independent subscribers.Appearing on a stage with other key Brexit figures, including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Gina Miller, the leading Tory rebel said “ordinary life will grind to a halt” if the talks are still deadlocked as D-Day nears.The warning came as Mr Rees-Mogg launched his most outspoken attack yet on big businesses opposing a hard Brexit, claiming they have “got everything wrong in the whole of their history”.Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, suggested she would not accept any further “compromises”\u0026nbspbeyond the deal struck at Chequers by Theresa May – preferring a no-deal outcome.And, at the event in central London, Labour’s Chuka Umunna urged his party not to “lie to our voters” by claiming that leaving the EU could ease concerns in immigration, when a “different model of capitalism” was needed.The one-time leadership candidate also appeared to have ruled himself out of a future race, with Labour in Jeremy Corbyn’s iron grip, saying: “I’m not sure the Labour party would have me to be quite frank!”Last month, Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, led an aborted revolt to guarantee MPs a “meaningful vote” to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU without an agreement.In his most dramatic language yet, to underline the high stakes, Mr Grieve told the audience: “If by the end of February or early March\u0026nbspit is clear that there is no deal on anything, there will be a declaration of a state of emergency in this country.“Actually, ordinary life will grind to a halt. That is the extent to which our lives are intermeshed with the lives of our European partners, and that is what will happen if there is no deal on anything.”Mr Grieve said hardline anti-Brexit MPs had “abdicated” their responsibilities to the public\u0026nbspby boasting that they will do “absolutely nothing while we skated off the edge of the cliff into this major national crisis”.“That is the madness that has crept into some of the discourse in parliament,” he added.Meanwhile, Ms Leadsom refused to be drawn on whether she had contemplating resigning over the Chequers plan – as Boris Johnson and David Davis later did.“I won’t comment on what happened at Chequers – that was a cabinet meeting,” the Commons leader said.But\u0026nbsphinting any further concessions would be unacceptable, she said: “I will be looking at whether our red lines have been breached.”Insisting what was important was that the EU knew the no-deal threat was real, Ms Leadsom said: “We will be prepared to consider leaving without a deal.”Meanwhile, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked “vested interests” that were colouring the views of big businesses that wanted to protect themselves from tariffs on their goods.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

It’s less a question of whether I fancy a crack at it – I’m not sure the Labour party would have me, to be quite frank.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

The shore is lined with hostile Remainers. As for the voters — the 17.4million “thick and ignorant racists” who backed Brexit in 2016 — who cares about them?Britain is now offering a peace deal to Brussels which, however we gloss it over, stinks of surrender.To quote Boris Johnson, who backed it: “You can’t polish a turd.”This is not a White Paper. It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This fudge is the result of the PM’s dithering and failure to plan for “no deal” — that essential weapon of any negotiator’s armoury.Had she won the 100-plus majority predicted before last year’s election things would be different.

Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.MICHAEL Fallon is right to try to stop ­taxpayers’ cash being used to reopen cases from the Troubles.Our ageing veterans live in fear of arrest for difficult decisions taken decades ago in a war zone.This witch-hunt MUST end.OUR boys’ World Cup success is set to cause a baby boom as randy fans celebrate by romping.If the Three Lions deliver us the World Cup there will be a BOOM in certain names, too.Expect some Harrys and Gareths.

Hunt refused to be shunted aside and ultimately secured the promise of another £20billion a year in NHS cash. He has earned a promotion.His replacement Matt Hancock has an enormous brief to learn rapidly — but he too is highly capable.And Leave-backing Dominic Raab could make a terrific, energetic Brexit Secretary if Mrs May lets him.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She says it meets the wishes of Sun readers who wanted the Government to draw a “red line” to end free movement.“For the first time in decades we will have control of our borders,” the PM writes. She also insists Britain WILL be able to strike trade deals with countries “queuing up to make trade deals with us”.Urging rebel MPs to back her, she says the only alternatives are a Norway-style deal or Labour “opening the door to a second referendum”.She adds: “Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up.

So he had gagged me with a condom.I was too young, thank God, to know what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate. And what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket?Sorvino was one of the first actresses to go public with allegations against Weinstein.In the New Yorker magazine in October last year, she said that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders in a Toronto hotel in 1995.Following the flood of allegations against Weinstein, Lord Of The Rings director Sir Peter Jackson revealed the producer had waged a smear campaign against the actress after she rejected his advances.Weinstein told the filmmaker Sorvino was a nightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.In December, Sorvino, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Woody Allen’s 1995 comedy Mighty Aphrodite, said she burst out crying after reading Sir Peters revelations.She said: There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest.

People in other places are allowed them in their community gardens.

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

Ceri Poulton, 31, ballooned to a size 20 by gorging on chocolate for breakfast and scoffing kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza, sending her weight rocketing to over 15st after leaving secondary school. She said: “I have always been a big girl. Throughout school I was so overweight that when the boys found out I was playing Juliet in the school play none of them wanted to play Romeo and we had to get a girl to play the role. “I was 11-years-old, in Year Six and I heard all the boys say ‘no, I’m not doing it. It was pretty embarrassing.  “Secondary school was easier for me. I used my quick wit and humour to gain popularity and my weight didn’t feel like such a big deal anymore. “I slowly gained weight through the 10 years following until I had my daughter in 2009 when I hit 15st 2.5lb. My daughter’s christening photos sent me into shock. One day I had purchased a size 20 dress from Primark because I couldn’t find anything nice in my size. At 5ft 8, I suit being a little bigger but that was beyond crazy.  “I had sunk into a pattern of eating when I was tired, using my daughter as an excuse to not exercise. “I never exercised. I ate chocolate for breakfast, and I loved kebabs, crisps, chips and pizza – all the bad carbs! “I wanted to change. My mum was unfit and overweight and as much as I adored her, I wanted something different for my own daughter. I wanted her to be healthy.  After the birth of her daughter and her mum’s terminal cancer diagnosis Ceri decided to turn her life around and embraced a healthy lifestyle. She lost more than four stone, started to exercise, retrained professionally and landed her dream job at a hospital where she met her ‘soulmate’. “I never thought anyone would want to marry me but now I’m planning my dream wedding with my perfect partner and I’m so happy, said Ceri.  Her real life Romeo, Lewis, an electrician, strode into her life one day to fix a fan in the office. “At first I thought he was grumpy but then I noticed that he was very good looking. So I glanced at his name badge and looked him up on Facebook. “I messaged him and said I thought he was very good looking, and embarrassingly he asked who I was. After a few messages I asked him out on a date and he said he’d think about it! “Then the next week he messaged me back and said he’d love to go on a date.  Recalling their first date together, Ceri said: We went to a country pub. We sat by the fire and chatted over a drink, it was amazing. When we were leaving he asked if I’d walk with him to the boot of his car. I wondered if he was going to murder me and stuff me in it! But when he opened it there was a huge bunch of flowers which he gave to me. “He told my daughter, Jasmine, months before he proposed that he was going to ask me to marry him. We’re so close it was torture for her not to tell me. Every time we passed a place she knew I wanted to get married in she’d say ‘Mummy, there’s something I really want to tell you but I can’t.’ “So I had an inkling that he might be thinking about it. Then we went on holiday together and I was sure he would ask me then. I made sure I looked proper nice every day but nothing happened. When we got home from the airport I was devastated. “Then weeks later we went to a restaurant in Dartmoor to celebrate our third year anniversary. When we got back we sat in the car for a while just chatting and enjoying the peace.  “He asked me to get him something from the glove compartment and there was a ring. He said ‘Ceri Poulton, will you marry me?’ “And I said ‘yes’ immediately before he could change his mind! “He really is amazing. If I die tomorrow I’ll die happy knowing that my daughter is well cared for. The couple will tie the knot surrounded by family and friends in a Christmas ceremony in November next year. I’ve been dress shopping but I haven’t decided exactly what I want yet. I tried on really tight fitting dresses which looked amazing but I love dancing and eating so I think I’ll go for something less restrictive like a princess style in the end.” Ceri\u0027s fairytale ending comes after months of hard work and determination to lose weight.  “In 2009 I saw a billboard outside the local church which advertised a Slimming World class. I decided to go and check it out and I’ve never looked back. “I steadily lost weight over the next two years, just by changing the way I was cooking, walking more and treating myself once a week after weigh-in so I wasn’t missing out.” Ceri found Slimming World a hugely supportive environment and the more targets she hit, the more she wanted to smash the next weight-loss goal. “Losing the first stone was slow. I still treated myself a lot and wasn’t really that bothered about it. But once I lost the first stone I realized I really wanted this.”  “By November 2012 I was crowned Slimming World Miss Slinky 2012 for my slimming group and reached my 4stone award. “Before this I couldn’t swim and I never really ran but now I take part in charity runs and swimathons – even though that means doggy-paddling through all those miles of water. “You only have one life and you’ve got to make the best of it.” Ceri has maintained her 4stone weight loss and almost won Slimming World’s Biggest Loser award – the most challenging one there is recently. I cried when I didn’t make it but maybe next year I’ll get it, she said. “I am currently trying to reach my 4.5st award in time for my wedding but after being at target for six years it is very difficult! I never allow myself to get wrapped up in dieting, I live my life and I love it. “Now I work out hard, my week consists of running, weights and three body balance classes a week. “I challenge my work friends to Race At Your Pace cycling and running challenges and I am constantly increasing my medal collection.  “I have about 15 medals from charity runs, I bought a medal holder for them which is in my room and every time I see it it motivates me to win more. “In 2016 I zip lined across Bournemouth Pier and drove Segways around Prague, things I never would have done before. “My daughter chooses salad and fruit over crisps and chocolate and she knows that in order to have a large treat we have to go for long walks or swim.

Children have been left crying with some bargain hunters even turned away from queuing before the shops opened this morning. The Build-a-Bear offer is precisely what it says - a child pays their age to create one of the popular teddies, for one day only. If you want to get a bear for your five-year-old child, you\u0027ll pay just \u0026pound5. If you\u0027re 25 years old, it\u0027ll cost you \u0026pound25. All bears are included in the deal and the minimum price for this offer is \u0026pound1 (even for those younger than a year old). But now stores are turning away customers because the demand is so high it has led to \u0027safety concerns\u0027 - with the police even reportedly called to some shops. Are you stuck in a Build-a-Bear queue? Email webnews@mirror  In Belfast, the store was closed amid claims a person was assaulted and police were called.  Belfast Live reports the store ran out of stock and a spokesperson for the company said the store was closed in the interest of the safety of our employees and our guests.  Police were also called to the store in Solihull\u0027s Touchwood shopping centre after reports of trouble in the giant queue.  Birmingham Live reports that officers were called following reports of a disturbance.  One mother even claimed to have witnessed shoppers throwing bears out of the store, into the crowds. West Midlands Police said they were called to the scene but no arrests were made.  Stores in Telford, Shropshire, Basingstoke, Hampshire and Sheffield, were forced to shut early amid safety fears. One mum was refused entrance when she tried to join the queue at the Build-a-Bear store in Meadowhall, Sheffield, despite arriving before the shop opened. She said: “We arrived around 9.45am, about 15 minutes before it was due to open. “The line was almost full length of one side of the shopping centre. “A member of staff told us to go home as we couldn’t join the line and it was up to a nine hour wait for people already waiting.” Devon Live is reporting that staff members are \u0027exhausted\u0027 as they did not anticipate it being so busy.     The store say demand has been \u0027unprecedented\u0027 leading to huge queues and even some reports of violence. Deborah, who had taken her month-old newborn tot Elsie to the shop in Malton, North Yorkshire, said: I just thought it would be something good to do and save some money. But I\u0027ve seen kids who should be in school with their mums queuing up to get a toy - I think it\u0027s wrong. Fiona O\u0027Reilly, 31, from Gateshead, arrived at the  Centre at 8.15am today in order to purchase bears for each of her four children. She was shocked by the hundreds of parents already queuing before the shop opened at 10am and feared there could be fights as parents argued in the queues. She said: It was complete madness I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if there were a few riots over this today. I managed to get there early and it took just over an hour for me to get all four bears. However, the queues are starting to get so long, and the store only has four staff making the bears, so I reckon people will be waiting all day. There\u0027s already people fighting in the queues!  Mum Kimberley Gray, 24, from Cardiff, said it would be worth the wait for her three-year-old daughter Lilly. It will be worth it because she\u0027ll be so happy, she said. Dawn Collard, 52, from Barry queued at the Cardiff store with seven children. Two are her grandchildren and the others are children she looks after as she is a childminder. She said: “I think it’s amazing. My bill should have been \u0026pound150 but I only paid \u0026pound27. I bought them for all the kids. They absolutely loved it.  Queues started building outside stores early and have now ballooned to such a scale some stores are telling customers not to join. One shopper, who didn’t want to be named, told Essex Live: “It’s so busy, the whole of the centre outside Mark and Spencer is queueing like a snake back and forth, pushchairs and children everywhere. The Lakeside staff have said that the people at the front of the queue have been there since 8am. Huge crowds have gathered outside the store in Maidstone and a queue with an estimated four hour waiting time is zig zagging down the high street, with the end reaching as far as Card Factory, as parents desperately try to nab a bargain for their child.    Mum Leonnie Braker was lucky enough to nab an early place in the queue at the Greenhithe shopping centre, and her one-year-old twins escaped with Star Wars themed bears. She told Kent Live:  I\u0027m pleased. Wouldn\u0027t have bothered if I\u0027d got there later. Just heard they only have 1800 bears and there are 1000 at least in queue and people have more than one kid with them.     Kate Lowe said: We got to Build-A-Bear at Intu Derby before 9am for Pay Your Age Day and there was a four-hour queue! I couldn\u0027t even see the end of it! We got donuts and went home. A parent, who didn’t want to be named, said: “We got here at 9am, three hours we’ve been queuing for and we’ve just reached the door to the shop. It’ll all be worth it when we see the children\u0027s faces though.”  Nick Scully, manager of the store told Derbyshire Live the store has sold several hundred bears. In Hull security staff took control and erected barriers to control the queues before refusing to let anyone else join and giving vouchers out that entitled the families to \u0026pound12 off their next bought item at the store. Staff said they thought around 500 people were queuing for the bears. A huge queuing is spiralling inside Manchester Arndale, which Rebecca Robinson has joined with her daughter Sophia. She said: I reckon there\u0027s around 1,000 people at least. I got told at Bristol there’s over 2,000 people waiting. They\u0027ve stopped people queuing for now because there are too many. Sharon Price John, president and chief executive officer of Build-A-Bear Workshop, said:  We have overwhelming data that indicates Build-A-Bear is synonymous with childhood, and nearly one-third of our sales are associated with birthdays. “We ‘heart’ birthdays at Build-A-Bear, so we’re hosting the Pay Your Age Day to launch our year-round ‘Count Your Candles’ offer for guests celebrating a birthday with us in stores - an experience we designed especially to commemorate birthdays in a memorable way.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"england croatia world cup hangover","story":"NewsEngland World Cup hangover: Fans plunge into canals and start fights after Croatian defeatMen and women are seen throwing punches in a clip taken in Birmingham last night as chaos broke out despite police appeals for calm\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNeil MurphyDave Burke09:45, 12 JUL 2018Updated12:00, 12 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRowdy football fans caused chaos in the aftermath of the Three Lions\u0027 2-1 World Cup defeat to Croatia, with shocking footage showing brawls breaking out and people plunging into a canal. Disorder was reported across the UK, with large fights in Liverpool, Birmingham and Hull caught on camera, and groups attacking police in London. Emergency services reported a huge volume of calls as fans vented their frustration after England crashed out of the competition. Men and women are seen throwing punches in a clip taken in Birmingham last night as a fight broke out despite police appeals for calm. And football fans were seen diving into canals and climbing lampposts in Britain\u0027s second city, the Birmingham Mail reports. Did you see any trouble after last night\u0027s game? Email webnews@trinitymirror  In London a senior police officer said a group had attempted to attack him and a colleague in Shoreditch while they were giving first aid. City of London Police Superintendent Billy Duffy posted on Twitter: Disappointed by a small group within the crowd who wanted to provoke / intimidate / attack me + colleague when we were alone + attempting to administer first aid. The London Ambulance Service said it was called to 300 incidents per hour in the aftermath of the game.   One 999 call was made for someone who had climbed - and fallen from - a lamppost. West Midlands Ambulance Service said that in the hour following the close of play, it had taken almost 240 999 calls compared to 120 in the hour before.     In Liverpool, angry fans threw bottles and trays inside a pub in St Helens, the Liverpool Echo reports. The Gerard Arms pub later released a statement blasting mindless thuggery, saying the World Cup had been peaceful up to that point. It said: What we cannot plan for is one case of sporadic mindless thuggery. Unfortunately a fight broke out as England were knocked out and we immediately closed the bar and we tried our best to contain the incident.  Police also had to break up a large brawl in Hull as tempers ran high, the Hull Daily Mail revealed. And in the capital, the politan Police said there had been a small number of incidents and arrests, but the force\u0027s football unit thanked the public for making our job tonight easier. Overall police said there was no repeat of ugly scenes which marred England\u0027s win over Sweden at the weekend.  How to cure a bad hangover - fast and quick cures from best foods to science-approved tricks  Humberside Police and door staff had to break up a brawl in Hull which broke out during the match. BBC reporter David Harrison caught this picture from the police’s Silver Command suite in Hull.    Punches were being thrown as tempers flared after Croatia equalised against England, which ultimately led to their victory and Three Lion’s defeat. In Nottingham, where a taxi was smashed up after the 2-0 quarter-final victory against Sweden, more officers were drafted in - and some rest days cancelled - to quell any disorder. Steve Cooper, who led the policing operation, said: We have made two arrests for domestic abuse-related offences, but the levels of criminal damage, disorder and antisocial behaviour that we saw on the weekend have not been repeated.  People have been really cooperative and patient while we closed a number of roads in the city centre to move on the crowds of people leaving Nottingham Castle and have made their way under instruction of uniformed colleagues. The National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council (NPCC) said 387 football-related incidents were recorded at the weekend, mostly alcohol-related disorder. But Wednesday evening passed more peacefully with police saying the vast majority of fans left pubs and parks with their heads held high and without issue.  A mass brawl kicked off in a Birmingham city street involving over a dozen men outside the Cat and the Fiddle pub in Great Barr. In the footage, shocked football fans look on in horror as men and women swing for each other in the middle of Waverley Avenue. Screams, cursing and grunts can be heard as the woman is attacked once more amid a large crowd of brawling fans.  One woman is even knocked to the floor in the vicious brawl as another female is seen throwing something at her. Several punters try to hold each other back from getting involved in the violence, but it then breaks up into several smaller fights. One man hurls several punches at a younger male, before chasing him around the corner towards Beacon Road. On Broad Street, 100 onlookers egged on as revellers jumped into the canal, including one young woman who needed treatment from an ambulance crew.  In a tweet, the service said: It’s been a disappointing night already, please don’t make it worse by doing something you might regret for the rest of your life. Lots of calls coming in for fights and other incidents leaving people injured when they didn’t need to be. #staysafe #HeadForHome  And the number of 999 calls has skyrocketed since Croatia\u0027s victory over England, the Assistant Chief at West Midlands Ambulance Service said. The service says it had taken over 240 emergency calls in the first hour since the football finished, compared to just 120 when fans were placated by the match.

Raymond Deane, 15, decided to wear the garment to Hugh Baird 14-16 College in Liverpool to stick up for a female classmate, says his mum Kim.   The Merseyside mum-of-two said her son was angry and upset, when he came home from school after a teacher had disciplined and sent home a girl for wearing a sports bra, reports the Liverpool Echo .  She said: Raymond thought that the girl should have been taken to one side and spoken to rather than disciplined in front of everyone.  He was upset because he thinks it is body shaming girls who are already insecure. Kim said, unbeknown to her, her son came home and asked his sister and her friends for sports bras to wear at school the following day. And the following day he and three friends arrived at the school wearing their sports bras in solidarity. However, the mum claims the four pupils were put into isolation and told to either take off the sports bras and go back to class or risk being sent home. The 36-year-old said: His friends took them off and went back to class, but he didn\u0027t and was sent home. He said the girl kept walking past the isolation room and smiling. He said if he had taken it off there would have been no point to the stand he was making.  Kim said her son, who previously attended The Blue Coat School, wanted to stand up for the female pupil and said she was proud of him. She said: I had no idea until I was sent pictures of what he had done. But I am very proud of him for standing up for young girls that are probably already insecure. I understand that the teacher had to send him home, because the girl had been sent home, but I don\u0027t think she should have been sent home in the first place. Hugh Baird is meant to be for pupils who don\u0027t fit into other schools and they are allowed piercings and pink hair - so why not sports bras?

Incredibly the device still had more than 80% of its charge, despite being dropped to the seabed two days earlier. It has now been reunited with its Canadian owner after it was dropped by a kayaker close to the coast in Dorset. Cerys Hearsey\u0027s attention was drawn to the phone when she noticed a flash of light on the seabed about 30ft down. It was in a waterproof case and still had 84% battery life.  She scooped it up, took it back to the shore and scrolled through the contacts to find its owner. It has now been returned to a grateful Rob Smith, whose Canadian cousin had lost it while the pair were kayaking at Durdle Door in Dorset. They were approaching the famous coastal landmark when the phone toppled over the edge of their boat. Although the phone was in a waterproof case they accepted they wouldn\u0027t be unable to recover it and returned home. Two days later, Cerys, 34, was diving in the area when she noticed the phone sat on the sea bed. She arranged to meet Rob, 34, and his wife Evie, in nearby Weymouth after the pair explained their cousin was by that time on a flight back to Canada. The phone has now been posted back across the Atlantic.  Cerys, who was visiting Dorset from her home in Essex, said she is pleased to be able to to return the phone to its rightful owner. She said: I could see the phone sitting on the bottom of the seabed because it received a message and lit up. I picked it up and returned to land where I cut it out of its case as it was starting to get a bit of water inside. I then looked up the numbers and got in touch with the owner\u0027s family. Phones are so critical to life nowadays they can be difficult to replace. The owner of the phone was on a flight back to Canada, so I met with the owner\u0027s cousin Rob.

It\u0027s not just hard work for staff beavering away behind the scenes. Spare a thought for the royals, because being on tour looks like VERY thirsty work.  At least if a photo of Meghan and Harry\u0027s visit to Ireland this week is anything to go by.  The Sussexes visited the Taoiseach’s office for a meeting with Leo Varadkar on Wednesday, and one photo has raised some eyebrows - and questions.   It\u0027s not just Meghan Markle\u0027s \u0027Sussex sit\u0027 which gets scrutinised every time she leaves the house. The refreshments on offer do too. And with good reason, because that is 14 bottles of water for a meeting between three people... INM editor Kevin Doyle first pointed it out, and it didn\u0027t take long for people to express their bafflement and concern.          As you can see, the reaction was mixture of amusement (come on, 14 bottles does seem a little excessive...) and criticism over the wastage. Still, it\u0027s just nice to see the focus not being the way Meghan sits for once...

The pair were filmed on the number 78 bus in London travelling from Shoreditch High Street to Peckham. The video begins with the pensioner – who carries a walking stick – standing over the woman who is sitting in ‘her’ seat on the bus. She yells: “You move!” but the seated woman calmly responds saying: “I’m not getting off here.” The pensioner angrily retorts back: “What do you mean you’re not gonna get off!”  Then shockingly, the furious old lady sits on the woman to force her to leave the seat. However, this doesn’t deter the woman who remains calmly where she is. After her first plan fails, she then grabs the woman by the shoulder instead and screams: “Come on, get off! Get off!” The enraged pensioner then yells: “I’m going to tell the driver. I always sit there, all the way home.” The old lady points at the empty seat next to the sitting woman and shouts: “I’m not sitting there!” The seated woman remains quiet and the pensioner continues shouting at her: “Where you going?

While they can’t help with the first two, Halfords thankfully has a range of products to help keep your pride and joy gleaming in the sunshine. H2-No! Water is certainly a good way to wash a car. Hosepipe bans don\u0027t prevent you from filling a bucket but we also know that any frivolous water use is making the problem worse for everyone. According to Uswitch, washing a car with a hosepipe uses between 400 and 480 litres of water, whereas completing the same activity using a faithful bucket draws around 32 litres. But there are risks involved with using a bucket and sponge, too. Sponges can pick up harmful foreign objects which can damage the layers of laquer on the panels of the car. With that in mind, let\u0027s look at other options.  The ArmorAll Waterless Wash \u0026amp Spray, \u0026pound10, is designed to clean your car of light dirt and dust. Simply spray the sections of the car that you want to clean and then wipe them clean with a microfibre cloth. The spray helps lift the dirt from your bodywork and allows you to wipe it off without risking damage to the paintwork. It\u0027s a much more high-tech solution than using water and it\u0027s helping to save water during our heatwave too. You may need more than one bottle if your car is large, so bear that in mind before you start. Careful wiping    The first thing you\u0027ll need to remember is that dirt causes scratches if you\u0027re not careful. Make sure that you have a decent amount of microfibre cloths before you start. Halfords sell a five-pack for \u0026pound3, so you may want to pick up a couple. When you\u0027re wiping the spray off it\u0027s important to use a cloth only until it gets dirty. So fold your cloth in half and use it four times before putting it aside for washing later. It\u0027s also important to only wipe in one direction. This will help keep the dirt from scratching the paintwork. Take precautions  Once your car is clean it\u0027s a good idea to wax it. A coat of wax puts a barrier between the paint and the outside world to protect it from rainwater, spray and debris.

Beth Bamford claims she had no idea she was pregnant and was stunned when she ended up giving birth alone in her bathroom. The 21-year-old, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, gave birth to 5lb 10oz daughter Willow as boyfriend Andy Morris, 22, lay sound asleep just along the landing. Poor Beth called for an ambulance and emergency services talked her through pushing out the afterbirth – but instead out popped twin Freya weighing 5lb 1oz.  But the new mum was terrified when the baby, who was breech, wasn’t breathing. Thankfully the quick-thinking emergency service caller was able to coach Beth through a lifesaving ‘little shake’ and the smaller twin took her first breath. Beth, who was already a mum-of-two, had visited her doctor numerous times thinking she was ill but neither the mum nor her doctors realised it was because she was pregnant. She claims she showed no signs of pregnancy because she was still having her periods, was not eating any more than usual and put the small amount of weight gain down to \u0027fat\u0027. However Beth says the new babies are a great surprise addition to her family. Beth said: “It’s a big shock but a nice surprise. I didn’t know I was pregnant at all.  “I was in bed with my partner and I was getting pains. I didn’t say anything to him but I went downstairs to get a glass of water and they got worse and I thought I needed the toilet. “I was still sitting on the toilet when I gave birth. I didn’t really have time to feel anything as it was happening. “It was a rush. One moment I was getting pain and the next moment I have got two new babies. “I hadn’t phoned an ambulance but I called the emergency services and they talked me through it as I gave birth to the first one.  “They told me I needed to get the placenta out. I pushed again but another baby came out, not the placenta. It was a shock. “The second one wasn’t breathing because she was breech. I was panicking about what to do because I wasn’t sure what to do with one, let alone two. “Nobody was answering me when I was shouting and I couldn’t wake my partner up because I was on the floor with the babies and couldn’t move. “Andy eventually woke up and walked into the bathroom and just looked at me. “He went to his mum’s bedroom and said: ‘Beth’s got two babies in the bathroom’. “She thought he had lost the plot because she knew we had two children already.  “Two ambulances came and asked lots of questions, like how far along I was or where my notes were. “They assumed I knew that information and had notes, but I didn’t. “I told them I didn’t know I was pregnant or having twins, but nobody believed me – even my partner thought I had hidden it from him. “I had had the shock of giving birth to babies, and then people accusing me of not knowing. “I had nothing, no nappies or anything, to take with me to the hospital.” Doctors believe Beth was around 37 weeks pregnant when she gave birth to the non-identical twins on February 21. She was told that if she had given birth in hospital, she would have had a C-section because Freya was breech. The newborns and their mum spent a week in hospital where she and the babies were checked over and monitored for signs of distress. But Beth, who is already mum to Elsa-Mae, three, and Alivia, two, was happy when all three of them were given the okay to go home. Beth said: “I feel lucky because it could have been a lot worse. “I have settled down a bit now, but it is scary going from two to four. It helped having a lot of support. “I have not had to go to and buy anything for them, because people went out and bought clothes and baskets and things for them. “I showed no signs of pregnancy and I even had my periods.

Teopanzolco is an Aztec archaeological site in southern Mexican, which due to modern building, now lies within the city of Cuernavaca. The impressive discovery has taken 10 months to unearth fully, after the earthquake which registered 7.1 magnitude, in September last year. The tremor damaged the base of the pyramid, called the Great Platform and exposed the previously-unknown temple. Most of the remains date back to the Mesoamerican Postclassic Period (900-1521 AD). The Tlahuica people founded Teopanzolco and nearby Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca), before they were conquered in 1427 by Aztec emperor Moctezuma I.  Following their defeat, they were integrated into the Aztec Empire and obliged to pay tribute and take part in military campaigns. The Great Platform is believed to date back to 1100 to 1150 AD and was later dedicated to Tlaloc, the supreme god of rain in the Aztec religion. Archaeologist Barbara Konieczna said: We are finding walls of a temple that, according to its location and architectural characteristics, was built early in the Postclassic Period. This archaeological site is older than Tenayuca in the Valley of Mexico and the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in capital Mexico City. Experts now believe that this form of architecture was first developed in the Morelos region in the south and was later replicated in those other sites.

Mum Olga Kuldo, 55, suffered dark thoughts and even feared she would die as she desperately clung to the airbed in the open ocean.  She had gone into the water for a quick swim - but ended up being buffeted by huge waves after strong currents swept her out to sea.  That night, she suffered hypothermia and feared attacks by sharks and other deadly creatures - with passing yachts failing to notice her. “The waves were huge, and I did my best to hang onto my airbed, recalled Olga, who amazingly survived the ordeal, against the odds.  “When the waves calmed, I was tired and feared I could fall asleep. So I sang songs to the birds flying over my head as a way of staying awake.” As dawn broke, the Russian tourist was then fried by the piercing sun. Fearing she might not survive, her thoughts turned to her husband Oleg, 59, and daughter Yulia, 28, who were worrying about her. “I thought of Oleg and Yulia, and then about all my relatives, she said. “I thought how they would be hurt by my death. This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. “I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.” Olga is reported to have been seven miles out to sea when she was eventually found after a plane spotted her floating in the water. Now, she has spoken out about her horrifying plight for the first time, revealing how she managed to survive her 21 hours of terror.  The cardiologist had gone for an afternoon swim - despite worsening weather and a ‘yellow’ warning flag - without telling her family. They thought she was having three-hour spa session on the Greek island, when in fact, she had been swept out to sea by the currents. “I went into the water, lay on my lilo and next moment the waves carried me away from the shore,” recalled Olga, from Zelenograd, near Moscow. “In no time, I found myself in deep water where I couldn’t touch the bottom with my feet. I am not a good swimmer, so I just grasped tight to my airbed and thought that soon I would manage to paddle my way to the shore. “But instead, the current and the wind carried me further and further away… then I began to shout and wave but nobody on the shore noticed.” As Olga found herself in the open water, her husband and daughter were worrying about her in their resort of Rethymno.  As night came, an eagle flew over my head and then a storm broke out ten minutes later,” the mother said. She sang to the birds flying above her, talked to herself and even counted the moves of her arms to stay alert. I did not sleep for second, I kept moving,” she said. I was so sure that if I put just a bit more effort, soon I would reach the shore, but in reality I was not moving at all. “I constantly saw some yachts - but they were far from me. I thought about ships or fishermen, but no-one came close enough to me.” As more birds flew by, Olga feared that one of them may get interested in me and my airbed. “I feared they may want to peck my head or airbed, she said. “It was truly horrible at night, all sorts of thoughts flashed across my mind, and the storm was outrageous. I did not look back trying to face the waves with my back because it was horrifying.  “I only hoped that these strong waves would bring me to the shore but nothing like this happened.” She admitted that, at times during her ordeal, she was overcome by “dark thoughts” and the fear she would die. She thought of letting the airbed go - but thankfully didn’t. It was her lifeline and without it, she would have drowned. She had another fear, too - sharks or other threats in the deep. “I felt things touching my legs, Olga recalled. “I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me. “I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.” Olga\u0027s family had realised something was amiss at 7pm local time, when she failed to return from her spa appointment. By then, the mum had been in the sea for four hours. Her belongings, including her purse, were found on the beach.  “This was the start of our nightmare,” said Yulia, a TV producer. Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out. “It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm, she added. The family was reportedly told that a helicopter would be deployed to search for Olga - but only the next morning. Yulia was in panic. “We were told to wait, to calm down,” she claimed. “But I kept asking questions, and the statistics was not encouraging – 10 to 20 tourists die in the sea at Crete each year.” The frantic daughter found herself asking morbid questions. “I asked how often they find people or their bodies, or do people just go missing and it ends with nothing…? she said. “I wanted to know how quickly a dead body would come to the surface…” She said she and her father couldn’t sleep. “I fainted several times,” she said. “I had dreams - in one my mum suddenly walked in she and sound.” But she also saw her mother being covered by waves, and drowning.  “The feeling of helplessness was disgusting, she added. “We did not know how we could help the search operation. “At midnight, they said the storm was worsening. It was slowing down the rescue operation. “This is when we expected the worst. But my dad said if anyone would stick herself to the airbed, my mum would. “But he also worried she could be covered by a wave.” The pair walked along the beach in the morning. By this time, divers were our looking for Olga. “They were searching for her body,” admitted Yulia. “No-one believed she could survive. Yet by the following morning, Olga had survived the storm, and she congratulated herself on reaching her 55th birthday. But she also feared she would not live to celebrate it with her family. They had planned a day trip to Santorini as a birthday present. In her head, her husband and daughter had set off on the trip and when she got herself to shore, she could get a taxi and catch them up.  “I did not blame the sea,” she said. “I was singing songs about the sea, all I could remember, talking to my family, but I was not angry about the sea. “I only asked it – ‘why do you want me? What do you need me for?’ During her agonising time out at sea, the mum could mostly see the shore in the distance. But she said it never occurred to her that searches were under way to find her. Somehow, she believed she had to get back herself. “I saw the coast and sometimes people walking there, she recalled. I waved but no-one saw me.” In fact, once Oleg and Yulia raised the alarm, boats had gone out. However, they had failed to locate Olga. “And at one moment a plane flew over her head,” said Yulia. “Then a second plane. “This returned and flew over her once again. “My mother thought it was just some random plane. She knew she had to send some kind of a signal because her forces were leaving her. “She just put her hands together as if she was praying”. Olga said: “I could hardly move, my muscles felt like stones. “I was hardly moving, I thought the pilot may not understand that I need help, so I just put my arms together as if I was praying, and lifted them over my head.”  In fact, the crucial first sighting was from a Frontex plane - which patrols the external borders of the European Union, monitoring for illegal immigrants. “As soon as the second plane disappeared over the horizon, I heard a boat’s engine and understood that it was heading straight to me, she said. “Five big men dressed in dark clothes were standing on it and shouting as loud as possible – they were shocked to find me alive. “They threw me a floating ring, and waved me to grab it, but I was quickly sorting my bikini which had slipped off. “I just could not be seen like this by the men – I think they understood it and waited. Yulia recalled the moment her mum was saved. “They began to lift her from the water – and my mother only worried that her bikini,” she said. “She also wanted to keep her airbed but at the last moment she lost it, and the wind swept it away like a balloon.” The brave mother was wrapped in a thermo-blanket and had an oxygen blanket placed on her face.  “She did not quite understand the scale of her accident,” Yulia said. Olga had suffered hypothermia and dehydration, according to her family. The skin on her back was also badly burned. Yulia was at the hotel reception when the news came through. “It was at this moment police called,” she said. “They reported that a woman was spotted in the sea who was likely to be my mother, but it was not clear at that moment. I was given a chair to sit on, so I crossed my fingers and begged that it was her. “In three minutes I heard hotel people shouting, they ran up to me and confirmed it was really my mother. “I suddenly felt weak and my body instinctively bent double. “Next moment somebody caught me falling down. “They poured water on me and slapped me on the cheek. “It really helped me to come back to my senses. “I felt my legs again and they obeyed me. “I stood up and rushed to tell my dad.” They were driven to a local hospital to be reunited.

There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3b4f0f73369-846x564.jpg ","title":"dundee bar intends to reopen months after closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA West End bar that closed without warning will reopen in September.The Mayfly and events space Door Below, on Perth Road, closed without warning earlier this month.But the pub has now announced it intends to reopen later this year after an extensive refurbishment.A post on The Mayfly’s Facebook page stated: “We are currently closed for refurbishment, reopening at the beginning of September.”The bar is owned by Fuller Thomson, which also operates Duke’s Corner and the Jute Cafe Bar at the DCA.At the time, staff said they had felt “feel very hurt and let down\u0026#8221 at the sudden closure.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4485911d088-685x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fans in portugal an inspiration for keeper jack hamilton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park new boy Jack Hamilton says the sight of Dundee fans making the trip all the way to Portugal to watch their side is an inspiration.The Dark Blues have been in the Algarve since last Wednesday, playing a training game with Sunderland and another with Portuguese top-flight side Portimonense on Sunday before finishing things off with a friendly clash with local side SC Farense last night.That game is expected to draw some away support after a handful of supporters showed up for the 4-0 training game loss on Sunday at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira.And that dedication to their team is something Hamilton wants to repay in the coming season.He said: “It says a lot for the fans to come out here.“They could have gone anywhere on holiday to be fair but they’ve come here to show the boys a bit of support and we really appreciate that.“It’s fantastic and, hopefully, we can repay them for coming to places like this with good results.”For Hamilton, as a new signing, the trip to Portugal has been a great way for him to get to know his team-mates a lot better. And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding. It was perfect.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/Wyn-Davison-e1513870724636-930x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people family of wyn hope you can help make her 102nd birthday by sending her a card","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe family of a pensioner are hoping people from across the UK will help make her birthday celebrations extra special.Wyn Davison will be turning 102 on July 22 and is unable to get out of her home in Washington, Tyne and Wear, very often.Nephew Ron Clark came up with the idea of asking people from far and wide to send her birthday cards and wishes just like they did at Christmas where over 400 festive cards were sent.Ron told the Sunderland Echo: “It was amazing for her to get 400 Christmas cards.“She was thrilled with it.

We think they’re keen to see it happening.”The Marketgait proposals are one of a small number of developments cropping up away from the Waterfront.Mr Mudie said: “Because of the Waterfront people have a keener interest in looking at city centre sites for development.“If it wasn’t for that there wouldn’t be any of the interest there is now. Companies in Glasgow and Edinburgh will be watching to see what the appetite is. They see Dundee as an untapped opportunity.”The Marketgait project is the biggest, in terms of cost, that Brunton has worked on yet.Mr Mudie added: “One of the reasons we think the council are so keen is because they want to take some of the attention away from the Waterfront.“The petrol station works on its own but I’m assuming our client believes they can get more out of the site.”Mr Mudie says the developer has given his firm free rein to design the new building, and plans are set to be submitted to council “imminently”.The plans received mixed reviews from the public.Pat Rae, 49, an admin assistant from the East End, said: “You have buildings across the road which are lying empty – I don’t see why they aren’t developed instead. You get a lot of traffic but a lot of it is commuters so I don’t think it would attract many folk to the restaurant or shop. I don’t think it would be of much benefit.”Colin Potter, 52, a telecoms engineer from the West End, said: “I think it’s a good idea. There’s always a need for new housing. These will maybe not be that cheap but it might be that people move into these and free up other houses in the

chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, recalled the retailer had moved several times in the city centre before settling into the Eastgate unit.\"It\u0027 an undoubted blow to the city centre in that it is closing,\" he said. \"It is good that it is staying in the city but it is that whole debate about out-of-town versus the city centre.\"It is quite clear that all High Streets and even shopping centres are under extreme pressure because of internet shopping and the way people choose to shop. There are consequences of the way we shop.\"I think the challenge is to maintain a city centre which is an attractive place to visit and socialise and purchase things.\"Mr Nicol said \"an awful lot of hard work\" remained.\"It is a hard task but I think if the public and private sector work together we can do that,\" he said. \"We need to maximise all the opportunities that there are and the

Although Britain made the longest advance since trench warfare began, the battle ended up as a costly stalemate for both sides.Although it was considered a victory for the British, they lost more than 150,000 casualties and little gain was made.James’s remains were found in a field in France at the site of the battle. However, it was not until a public appeal that his identity was finally confirmed.Speaking after the event, Steve Arnold from the CWGC said: “I was honoured to be able to recover Able Seaman Robertson from the battlefield where he lay for 100 years and privileged to be here today to see him laid to rest alongside his comrades.“We will care for his grave here forever.”The cemetery was started in April 1917 by units taking part in the battle.It was greatly enlarged after the Armistice by the concentration of graves from other small burial grounds and from the surrounding battlefields, including the area where James was killed.The CWGC has marked his grave with a headstone bearing his military and personal details, together with a personal inscription chosen by his family.The service was organised by the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) at the Ministry of Defence and was attended by family members, British Defence staff, Navy representatives, CWGC staff and dignitaries.JCCC was responsible for finding out who the remains belonged to and launched the public appeal earlier this year. Two options were narrowed down by the experts and it was Peterhead genealogist Kath Macdonald who helped solve the mystery.After looking up census records and knowing James was from a big family, she was able to track death records of his siblings.James’s sister Jessie Anne Robertson’s death was registered by a Francis Treasurer.Kath entered that name into a search engine, which led her to the Facebook page of St Mary’s Cathedral on Huntly Street and a Frank Treasurer.Frank, who lives in Bridge of Don and is the former principal teacher of modern studies at Hazlehead Academy, was then asked to provide a DNA sample to confirm he is a relative of James.The 81-year-old travelled to France yesterday for the service to the uncle he never knew existed.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"angus pub accused of pure greed after revealing plans to charge open championship visitors more for drinks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of Carnoustie’s most popular pubs is preparing to hike prices for people visiting the town during The Open.The move by the 19th Hole Hotel has been slammed as a “tourist tax” by a senior councillor, but one of Scotland’s leading licensing lawyers has found it to be within the law.The hostelry outlined the pricing policy on social media and announced the bar will be cashless for the duration of the tournament.Locals and regulars have access to a PubCard, which they can “load” with cash.

Her project aims to collect global data on slug control, and enhance farming methods in the UK. However, she has also has her eye on influencing the world of politics.She added: “My short-term goal is to spin out my research into a feasible applied solution for the agricultural industry.“However, the MBA and my Nuffield Scholarship have really opened up my mind to various opportunities, and I would love to be involved with moulding UK agricultural policy as Brexit develops.”And the scholarship has allowed her to travel the world while developing her ideas.She said: “Earlier this year, I was chosen to be part of the Nuffield Farming programme, which fosters agricultural leaders of the future.\u0026#8220As part of this, I have travelled to Brazil, US, Canada, Netherlands, Czech Rep, Ukraine, Kenya and South Africa, and later this year I will travel to Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Slovenia in a quest to learn more about global agriculture.”She added: “I have a passion for science and agriculture and the MBA and Nuffield program have allowed me to put this together as a commercial opportunity.”Before studying for an MBA, Jenna studied Forensic Science at RGU, also spending some time with the identification bureau at Police Scotland before she decided to return to education to study PhD in Environmental Science at the University of Aberdeen.She said: “I have lived and worked around the world, but I am proud to say that all my education has been conducted in Aberdeen.\u0026#8220We are lucky to have such great facilities on our doorstep, and it was great to return to RGU as a postgraduate.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"one lane closed on busy aberdeen road for network repairs1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLane restrictions have been put in place on a busy Aberdeen road for emergency repairs.Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is carrying out the work on Anderson Drive between the King’s Gate and Queen’s Road roundabouts.SSEN has said it needs to enforce a single lane closure to allow repairs to the underground low voltage network to be carried out safely.Head of region at SSEN Neil Wilson said: “We recognise there is never a good time to close a lane on a busy road into Aberdeen so I would like to apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused to the public.“These emergency works are required to carry out essential repairs to the electricity network in the area to maintain a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team. The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dust flies in cracking argyll rally","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 12:07 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Dunoon Presents Rally on June 23 saw the Scottish Rally Championship roll into town and 58 top-spec cars and crews take to the stages.Dust flew in dry conditions up in the hills of Cowal as drivers tested their skills among forestry roads in what turned out to be an excellent rally.The route this year was slightly different, with two new stages added to a schedule which saw the cars cover each of the four stages twice through the day with two service stops at Dunoon Stadium along the way.There were a few well known Argyll faces out there, with mixed fortunes on the day.Douglas Watt from Furnace managed to rebuild his Escort after its small excursion on the Scottish Rally in May and he was out again, hoping for better luck and a finish for he and his co-driver, Mark Grierson. The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"26-year-old-admits-disturbances-at-bgh-and-innerleithen","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into an Innerleithen man who barricaded himself into a room before struggling violently with police.\nScott Ewart also caused a disturbance at Borders General Hospital later on May 28.\nThe 26-year-old of Millar Street pleaded guilty this week at Selkirk Sheriff Court to a charge of threatening or abusive behaviour at his home and also at the hospital.\nDuring the disturbance he had barricaded himself into a room in the house and ended up struggling violently with police constables.\nEwart remained disruptive at the hospital striking the handcuffs he was wearing against the wall.\nEwart also admitted a second charge of assaulting a police constable by spitting in his face.\nSentence was deferred for the preparation of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report until July 30.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"being-braw-lad-has-been-a-dream-come-true-says-greg","story":"ON Saturday Greg Kelly and Kimberley O\u0026rsquoMay realised their dreams of leading the cavalcade on Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Day.\nAnd it was an emotional occasion for the pair.\nBraw Lad Greg received the Burgh Standard at 8am on Saturday morning and returned it safely to the Burgh Chambers at midday, following a morning of celebrating Galashiels\u0026rsquo rich history.\nAnd it was a \u0026ldquodream come true for the 21-year-old who has always wanted to land the starring role.\nSpeaking after the events, he told us: \u0026ldquoA real highlight of today was receiving the Burgh Standard at eight o\u0026rsquoclock this morning and leading the cavalcade with my Braw Lass Kim.\n\u0026ldquoIt is a feeling that I will never forget.

conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.  The other is an archer planned for the banks of the River Esk, with its installation expected to be next week. A trail of arrows around the town is also planned and will link in with a Global Treasure App, a treasure trail organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-first-reverse-vending-machine-is-at-musselburgh-iceland","story":"  These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7984867.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=159\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothian-courier-wedding-competition-winners-revealed","story":"  Gemma Peters and Jamie Richardson are the couple who have claimed the prize of a wedding worth \u0026pound6,000 at the Dunmuir Hotel.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.

ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.  Twenty-year-old Emily\u0026rsquos involvement in the project is the latest step as she attempts to land her dream job.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.  Mr Paul, who is chairman of Glasclune Residents Association, said: \u0026ldquoWe feel that it is the wrong site for this.  \u0026ldquoWe are open to the accusation that it\u0026rsquos because it is at the back of our house and that\u0026rsquos partly fair \u0026ndash ideally we\u0026rsquod like to see the shelter pulled down.  \u0026ldquoBut rather than just saying it\u0026rsquos not right, we\u0026rsquove offered to the youth project to fundraise for an alternative.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of people who live here who have experience of managing projects.

Lauren Cowie, project manager at North Berwick Youth Project, insisted plans were \u0026ldquostill at a very early stage.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are committed to working with the entire community and in particular those who live near the proposed shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.

Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

Stepson Nik Rankin and close friend Liam Rudden paid tribute to Alan at the service, which started with the hymn Morning Has Broken and ended with Abide By Me.

But Mr Mundell hit back, branding Labour \"just Nicola\u0027s little helpers\" as he attacked the \"once proud unionist\" Scottish Labour Party for \"repeatedly voting\" with the SNP in Holyrood.  Speaking during Scotland Questions in the Commons, Mr Sweeney said: \"I feel I ought to congratulate the Secretary of State on achieving a new milestone as the longest serving member in one role in the Prime Minister\u0027s Cabinet, though I fear it may be a virtue of his invisibility rather than his invincibility\u0026hellip  \"The Secretary of State is failing to stand up for Scotland\u0027s interests when it comes to shipbuilding and his 12 Scottish Tory colleagues and himself have failed to stand up for Scotland\u0027s devolution settlement.  \"So, will he use the influence he should have developed over these last few years and condemn his Government\u0027s handling of the devolution settlement, demonstrating he isn\u0027t just Scotland\u0027s invisible man in the Cabinet?\" asked the MP for Glasgow North East.  Mr Mundell responded by saying: \"What I condemn is the once proud Unionist Scottish Labour Party repeatedly voting with the SNP in Holyrood.

The Edinburgh MP asked the Scottish Secretary: \u0026ldquoHas he worked out yet what the impact of the PM\u0026rsquos decision on the Scottish economy and what is he going to do about it?  Mr Mundell said the heart of the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos document, which was \u0026ldquofed in to the Chequers summit, was that the SNP administration did not want the country to leave the EU.  \u0026ldquoWhat the PM is focused on is leaving the EU on the basis that does best for British business but also respects the outcome of a referendum of the whole of the United Kingdom.  After the SNP\u0026rsquos Hannah Bardell also accused Mr Mundell of being \u0026ldquoinvisible and \u0026ldquoineffective in his role and called for him to resign, the Scottish Secretary accused her of \u0026ldquoreheating the same old stuff and declared: \u0026ldquoAt the heart of this is the SNP don\u0026rsquot accept and don\u0026rsquot like the representations I make on behalf of Scotland that is to keep Scotland in the UK.  His Tory colleague Steve Baker, who resigned earlier this week as Brexit Minister in protest at Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, denounced the \u0026ldquoludicrous theatrics of the SNP. \u0026ldquoThey are a disservice not only to the people of Scotland but to the people of the whole of UK for the detrimental effect they had on the passage of the EU Withdrawal Act, he said.  Mr Mundell went on to accuse the Nationalists of not being interested in Britain\u0026rsquos withdrawal from the EU, claiming: \u0026ldquoBrexit has been weaponised purely to take forward the cause of independence and have another independence referendum.  Later, Whitehall rubbished Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos claim of a \u0026ldquopower-grab in the Government\u0026rsquos new Brexit Act. A UK Government insider said: A UK Government source said: \u0026ldquoThere is no \u0026lsquopower-grab,\u0026rsquo it is just an SNP invention.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon expanded her ministerial team to record numbers to handle her Government\u0026rsquos additional responsibilities.

Millions tuned into the eagerly anticipated match, with sorrowful scenes up and down the country after days of singing \"It\u0027s coming home\".  Crowds gathered in London\u0027s Hyde Park, Millennium Square in Leeds, Nottingham Castle, Birmingham\u0027s Archway outdoor cinema - and even Los Angeles.  England came to a standstill as the 7pm kick-off approached, with roads deserted and shopping centres abandoned as fans dashed home to catch the historic game.  The 23-man England squad, which has an average age of just over 26 and was the tournament\u0027s third youngest, had the hopes and expectations of a nation on their shoulders.  But place in the World Cup final against France was not to be.  Within the first five minutes, English fans were given cause for celebration when Kieran Trippier scored a free kick, giving his side a dream 1-0 lead.  The crowd in Hyde Park went berserk as England scored, and those watching on the huge screen were drenched in beer as plastic cups flew through the air amid wild celebrations.  Some fans had tears in their eyes as they could not believe the dream start.  In Leeds, the crowd leapt up as if a goal had been scored when the half-time whistle blew.  But there were stunned reactions as Croatia scored the equaliser through Ivan Perisic.  It would have been the nation\u0027s first final since they won in 1966 but an extra time goal from Mario Mandzukic left dreams shattered.  Many fans had their heads in their hands, while others shook their heads in disbelief.  Police estimated as many as 10,000 England fans were in the Russian capital for the game.  Among them were father and son Joe and Andrew Settle, from Bolton, who have never travelled away with England but decided they could not miss the chance to see the national side in a World Cup semi-final.  For Joe, 62, it was his first live England match.  \"I think it\u0027s our year this time.  \"There\u0027s no out and out stars and everybody just looks at them as young lads, making their way out, they\u0027ve not got above their station.

However, in Scotland, the reaction was more mixed, with thousands backing England\u0026rsquos opponents throughout the World Cup as part of the \u0026ldquofriendly rivalry between the two countries.  In Glasgow, shops said they were swamped with requests for the distinct red and white chequered first kit of England\u0026rsquos Croatian opponents.  A spokesman for the Nike shop in Glasgow said they had been \u0026ldquoabsolutely inundated with requests for Croatia shirts, while Greaves Sports said it had completely sold out the tops before the crunch match.  Managing director Sandy Greaves said it showed the fun rivalry that \u0026ldquonormally happens any time England plays.  \u0026ldquoLast Saturday morning all the die-hard Scottish fans wanted the Swedish jersey, he added.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a Scottish thing. I\u0026rsquom sure the same thing happens down south.The rivalry was on open display in some pubs in Glasgow, where there were loud cheers as Croatia took the lead in extra time.  \u0026ldquoI was supporting Croatia, said Jonny Cowan, 29, from Kilmarnock, who was watching the match in the Waxy O\u0026rsquoConnors pub next to Queen Street station.  \u0026ldquoI mean, it\u0026rsquos all about the friendly rivalry.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos all good natured, but we\u0026rsquore the auld enemies.

However, there may have been more Scottish support for the England side abroad.  Royal Bank of Scotland said it had seen a 70 per cent increase in the number of debit card transactions in Russia over the course of the World Cup, compared to  a normal day outside of the tournament.  Haydn Williams, from RBS, said it was either a matter of Scotland fans secretly supporting England \u0026ldquoor perhaps they have been there supporting Tunisia, Panama, Belgium, Colombia, Sweden and Croatia.  There was also irritation for some Scottish viewers, with reports that the STV Player had gone down just minutes before the end of the cliffhanger semi-final.  Jamie and Ruth Aitken, from Peterborough, in Glasgow on holiday, said they were a \u0026ldquoa bit apprehensive about watching the game in Scotland.  Ms Aitken, who the saw the game at Waxy O\u0026rsquoConnors, said: \u0026ldquoWe asked people in the hotel where we should watch it and they said \u0026lsquoin our room\u0026rsquo.

And when Ivana suggested the name Donald Jnr, his dad countered \u0026ldquoBut what if he\u0026rsquos a loser?  The point of these little revelations is that they reinforce our opinion of a man capable of displaying utter contempt for creeds - his Moslem entry ban nations - Mexico persons of colour - the African-Americans barred from renting his apartments. We\u0026rsquore reminded of his tax avoidance, and the small businesses the man with the small hands refused to honour his debts to.  We know President Trump\u0026rsquos integrity to be as thin as the hair covering left after his failed scalp reduction operation.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot mean our political leaders (if the FM and her cohorts are granted an audience) should not treat Trump\u0026rsquos arrival with respect. London Mayor\u0026rsquos Sadiq Khan\u0026rsquos sanction this week of a giant nappy-wearing Trump balloon was capital balloonery, ersatz State-sponsorship.

Donald Trump may well be the Mad Hatter of World Politics, who can switch effortlessly to becoming the Queen of Hearts, killing off careers and opposition voices with a single Tweet. His administration puts children in cages. And as a political leader he makes our own clown Boris seem competent by comparison.  But The Donald represents the White House, and he bridges our relationship, so vital in the Second World War and during the Cold War, with the most powerful nation on Earth. The Leader of the Free World is coming to town (albeit to play a round of golf) and we have to treat him as such.  We have to push aside the fact he is the modern-day representation of WB Yeats\u0026rsquo 1919 poem, Second Coming \u0026ldquoThings fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. What is this strange beast slouching towards Bethlehem. (Holyrood?)  Indeed, our leaders have to understand and embrace the fact Trump singularly represents Yeats\u0026rsquo fear, when the poet anticipates the confusion, the terror of modern day politics, the growth of the far right across Europe, all confirmed by the fact that the venally ambitious Trump has been allowed to triumph in the first place.  For that reason we need to play the golfer. It would be all too easy for the FM and co to greet him waving Mexican flags or posting pics of little Guatemalan girls. That\u0026rsquos the job of student protesters and trades unionists and women\u0026rsquos rights groups, to take to the streets or the beaches of Troon or Aberdeenshire.. (Let\u0026rsquos hope predicted violence doesn\u0026rsquot ensue Trump won\u0026rsquot be looking out of the windows of Air Force One worrying about the havoc he\u0026rsquos provoked.)  But the reality is public name-calling won\u0026rsquot matter to this man who didn\u0026rsquot wish to have his son named after him in case he grew up to be a numpty.  Yet, he can be worked at a personal level. Like all petulant bullies he can\u0026rsquot handle face-to-face confrontation. So we can learn from French President Macron how to put Trump\u0026rsquos verbal gas at a peep. We can even learn from the \u0026ldquoLittle Rocket Man in how to lessen the likelihood of nuclear confrontation.  Our leaders, if they can get in a room with the man, need to be cleverer than Donald Trump, (which shouldn\u0026rsquot be hard.)They should feed him up on flattery and artery-hardening fudge, and then ask what he can do for our country?  It doesn\u0026rsquot matter that Nicola Sturgeon once refused to take calls from the man. Jaw-jaw is always better than war. So bring him onside, reach at least a vague understanding on trade economics and then try to get human rights onto the agenda.  And let\u0026rsquos bear in mind the upcoming Brexit chaos, (Trump\u0026rsquos declaration of a Britain being in turmoil is on the money), bear in mind too it could well open the door to Scottish independence - and the need to realign this country\u0026rsquos position on the world stage.  Trump\u0026rsquos arrival in Scotland in fact has its positives (if we can push aside the \u0026pound5m policing cost). He single-handedly represents the denial of democracy, the return of the despot to the West. He threatens the freedom of the press.  So let\u0026rsquos play with Ms Midlefart\u0026rsquos ex, but remember this isn\u0026rsquot a Chamberlain-Hitler scenario we\u0026rsquore dealing with. For not to do so could be dangerous. And in taking this pragmatic stance, by not endorsing giant balloons floating over Holyrood, we get to hold on to the string of dignity."},{"url":null,"title":"ariana-grande-i-felt-upside-down-after-manchester-bombing","story":"  The pop star had just finished performing on stage in Manchester on May 22 2017 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device, killing 22 people.

Sorvino has now said that during an audition for a horror movie when she was a teenager, she was tied to chair by a casting director who then shoved a condom in her mouth.  She did not name the alleged culprit.  Speaking on the Hollywood Foreign Press Association podcast, she said: \u0026ldquoIn looking back over at my career, I realised that one of my very first auditions when I was 16, I was completely treated inappropriately by the casting director.  \u0026ldquoIn order to scare me for this horror movie scene, he tied me to a chair, he bruised my arm and, I was 16 years old, and then he gagged me, and I was all game because I\u0026rsquom trying to be scared for the scene. And at the end he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said, \u0026lsquoSorry for the prophylactic.\u0026rsquo So he had gagged me with a condom.  \u0026ldquoI was too young, thank God, to know what a condom tasted like. It was so inappropriate. And what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket?  Sorvino, 50, was one of the first actresses to go public with allegations against Weinstein. In the New Yorker magazine in October last year, she said that Weinstein had chased her around a room after he started massaging her shoulders in a Toronto hotel in 1995.  Following the flood of allegations against Weinstein, Lord Of The Rings director Sir Peter Jackson revealed the producer had waged a smear campaign against the actress after she rejected his advances.  Weinstein told the filmmaker Sorvino was a \u0026ldquonightmare to work with, leading to her name being taken off his casting list.  In December, Sorvino, who won the Best Supporting Actress\u0026nbspAcademy Award for 1995\u0026rsquos Mighty Aphrodite, said she \u0026ldquoburst out crying after reading Sir Peter\u0026rsquos revelations.

Having announced earlier this year that the Homeward Bound tour would be his final farewell to the road, Paul Simon went out in some style, with a valedictory two-and-a-half hour trip through a songbook rivalled only by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen.  At 76, Simon\u0026rsquos powers showed little sign of waning. Backed by a big, brilliant band packed with horns, strings and percussion, capable of surfing every curve of these remarkable songs, his boyish voice was in remarkably good nick. He even threw a few faintly funky shapes during the frenetic Cajun gumbo of That Was Your Mother. A glorious Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard, the sharp, urgent Can\u0026rsquot Run, and sparse slap of Wristband were all reminders of what a rhythmically inventive writer he is.  Radiating all the glamour of a retired baseball coach, Simon proved a wry, amiable raconteur, sharing memories and creation stories. Yet there was little room for nostalgia. Indeed, at times the set flirted with downright irreverence. His radical \u0026ldquoreclamation of the hymn-like Bridge Over Troubled Water bordered on the sacrilegious, proof of an artist still bent on evolution. Elsewhere, celebratory romps through Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes, You Can Call Me Al and Kodachrome proved that, for all the cerebral words and painstaking craftmanship, so often Simon\u0026rsquos music is at its most potent emitting sheer kinetic joy.  Towards the end, the mood became more reflective, revealing new resonances. Homeward Bound, written as a young man\u0026rsquos anthem of displacement, now communicated a more spiritual need to belong. A deeply moving solo take on his 1973 immigrant song, American Tune, had added heft in the age of Trump, while he sang \u0026ldquoI am leaving, I am leaving on The Boxer with a knowing emphasis. Earlier he had promised, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not stopping, and there will be more recorded music to come, but if this was indeed the last ever sighting of Paul Simon on a Scottish stage, it was a departure entirely befitting a master."},{"url":null,"title":"only-1-in-4-back-sturgeon-calling-for-second-independence-referendum-this-autumn","story":"  The Daily Record survey found only 23 per cent of people thought the First Minister should push for a new vote, 19 per cent who wanted one later, while 49 per cent opposed it full stop.  The remaining nine per cent were don\u0026rsquot knows.  The findings increase the pressure on Ms Sturgeon as she considers her next move in the escalating constitutional fight with Westminster over Brexit.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017, then \u0026ldquoreset her plan three months later after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.  She had promised to update MSPs on a \u0026ldquoprecise timescale on a second referendum this autumn, once the shape of the final Brexit deals becomes clear.  Earlier this week, her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell suggested a second EU referendum could double as an independence vote if the 2016 result was repeated and Scotland backed Remain and the UK voted Leave.  There is fight between the UK and Scottish governments at the Supreme Court between now and the autumn, which could end in Westminster trampling over Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill, a huge moment the SNP would add to their case for independence.  But the lack of popular support for a second plebiscite will be a concern for the First Minister.  Nevertheless, the poll also found support for independence slightly higher than in the 55-45 No vote of 2014, with 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, excluding don\u0026rsquot knows.  The Scottish Parliament voted last year in favour of Westminster transferring the power to hold a referendum, but the request for a \u0027Section 30 order\u0027 was rebuffed by Theresa May.  If Ms Sturgeon pushed again for a referendum, the Prime Minister would almost certainly refuse again, but the SNP could cite the snub in the 2021 Holyrood election as evidence of Westminster arrogance, as they try to win a clear-cut mandate for a new vote.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said the poll showed that, despite SNP hopes of a shift in opinion, Brexit was still having little impact on the independence question.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the SNP have had somewhat the better of the argument in the row about the impact of Brexit Withdrawal Bill on the powers of the Scottish Parliament, there\u0026rsquos still no sign of any significant change in the level for support for independence \u0026ndash or much evidence of enthusiasm for an early ballot among the party\u0026rsquos supporters.  The Unionist parties said Ms Sturgeon should drop an idea the public didn\u0026rsquot clearly want.  Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard said: \"The people of Scotland want the government focused on jobs, schools and hospitals, not another referendum campaign that creates false divisions between working class people when the real divide is between the richest and the rest of us.  \"The chaos at the heart of the Tory government has focused people\u0026rsquos minds on the extreme challenges of leaving a political and economic union, and it is clear that there is not strong support for Nicola Sturgeon to try and force another referendum onto the agenda.\"  A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis poll again shows the majority of people do not want a second referendum - and they overwhelmingly don\u0026rsquot want one any time soon.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should use this research as motivation to take the threat of another divisive vote off the table.  The SNP highlighted the narrowing between the Yes and No sides on independence compared to 2014.  MSP Derek Mackay, the party\u0026rsquos business convener, said support for independence remained at historically high levels, \"with a Yes majority within the margin of error and well within touching distance\".  Dropping a hint that Ms Sturgeon was minded to push for a second vote, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not - yet - in the heat of an independence campaign.  \u0026ldquoBut as Westminster moves from chaos to utter shambles, proving beyond doubt it is incapable of protecting our interests, the case for independence becomes ever stronger.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that since last year there has been a marked rise in the number of people who back giving the people of Scotland that choice over their future.  \u0026ldquoWith the full powers of independence we could make better choices in Scotland\u0026rsquos interests and avoid the damage of a Tory Brexit.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added:\u0026nbsp\"It\u0026rsquos remarkable that support for independence remains so high given that the Yes movement hasn\u0026rsquot done a single bit of formal campaigning.  \"The status quo will no longer exist in March 2019 and I suspect that voters in Scotland will come to demand a say on whether we should be dragged along with this Brexit mess.\"  Survation interviewed 1002 Scots online between July 5 and 10."},{"url":null,"title":"salt-marshes-could-start-to-disappear-in-south-east-by-2040","story":"  Studying samples from sediments, experts have tracked sea levels over the past 10,000 years to study how changes have affected salt marshes.  Durham University researchers estimate that marshes in the south east of England could start to disappear from the year 2040, and across all of Great Britain by 2100.  The lasting effect of ice removal since the end of the last Ice Age means most of Scotland is rising and southern England is subsiding, which explains the difference in timescales.  The study, published in Nature Communications, shows that rising sea levels over the last 10,000 years has led to increased water-logging of the salt marshes, killing vegetation that protects them from erosion and resulting in the marshes retreating landwards.  Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides and can be found along the British coast.  They are a transitional area between water and land and are home to delicate ecosystems.  They also protect coastal areas from\u0026nbsperosion\u0026nbspby acting as a buffer for waves in storms and reducing flooding by slowing and absorbing rainwater.  Extensive marshes occur along major estuaries around Britain including the Thames, Solent, Bristol Channel, The Wash, Humber, Mersey, Solway Firth, Firth of Forth, Clyde and Cromarty Firth.  Co-author Professor Ian Shennan, from the Department of Geography at Durham University, said: \u0026ldquoSea level rise is inevitable over the next 100 years, as it has been over much of the last 10,000 years.  \u0026ldquoThe rates differ across Great Britain and we can model these differences.  \u0026ldquoQuantifying the vulnerability of marshes to sea level rise is essential if the threat is to be mitigated over the coming decades.  Professor Shennan said the Environment Agency has plans which include allowing new areas to flood.  The research involved scientists from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, University College Dublin, College of William and Mary, and Rutgers University, both in the US, and Durham University."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-hails-plan-to-deliver-principled-and-pragmatic-brexit","story":"  The 98-page document \u0026ndash which prompted the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis from her Cabinet \u0026ndash contains much to enrage Eurosceptic members of her own party.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 6:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Cremation costs more in the north","story":"GRIEVING families from Caithness are paying more than the national average to have their loved ones cremated, according to a survey out this week.The survey, conducted by comparison site Beyond, showed that out of all the public crematoriums in the United Kingdom, Inverness was the fifth most expensive.A cremation at Inverness costs \u0026pound904 \u0026ndash \u0026pound130 above the national average \u0026ndash while the highest rate is charged by Thorncliffe, in the Cumbrian town of Barrow, at \u0026pound959.Inverness crematorium is the most accessible to Caithness.

That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

There\u0026rsquos been nothing in the forecast.Anthony Kevill, general manager of the Ulbster Arms Hotel, said: \u0026ldquoA few salmon are still being caught, albeit not in the same numbers as recent years.\u0026ldquoWe had a German guest persevere all week in tough fishing conditions and his efforts were rewarded with two fish on Saturday morning, which just goes to show that with a bit of determination and a positive attitude the line could go tight on any cast!The lack of rain has not affected the number of salmon in the river. \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquore hiding in the holes of the estuary, Mr McCarthy said. \u0026ldquoThey are there \u0026ndash just waiting to come up once the river rises again.Mr Kevill agreed with this, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are hoping for some rain and when it does arrive we are confident that normal summer fishing business will resume.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 6:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick to John OGroats bus service gets a 12 month reprieve","story":"A THREAT to a \u0026ldquolifeline bus service between Wick, John O\u0026rsquoGroats and Gills Bay has been removed \u0026ndash for at least 12 months.That was confirmed yesterday by Stagecoach, which has decided not to go ahead with a controversial plan to axe the 77 service at Keiss.The company intended to make the change as from August 20 as not enough people were using the service but after widespread opposition changed its mind.A public meeting last month heard that a Canisbay man would not be able to visit his wife in a nursing home in Wick, while a woman said she may have to give up her job in the town if the changes went ahead. Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Thursday 12 Jul 2018 6:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 12, 2018 at 4:28 pmNo roads surface dressing work is planned for Friday or Monday, July 13 and 16.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Thursday 12 Jul 2018 6:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766391.1531416694!/image/image.jpg","title":"oldest higland bagpipes in existence to be played at clan meeting","story":"        The oldest Highland bagpipes in existence, and which rang out at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, are to be played for just the fourth time in 200 years.                The Faery Pipes of Kinlochmoidart, reputed to be more than 800 years old, are normally kept in a special case at the West Highland Museum, Fort William.            It is said that they are “enchanted” and have never been played on the losing side of a battle.            They will be taken out of the case for a clan gathering, the World Gathering of Macintyres, which takes place in Oban and Taynuilt next week.At the clan’s banquet in the Argyllshire Gathering Halls on Friday, 20 July, the pipes will be played by Andrew Macintyre from Edinburgh.They will be played again on Sunday, 22 July, by Ruaraidh Petre, nephew of Archie McIntyre, a descendant of the MacIntyres who formerly possessed them.This time they will be in Glenoe, the ancestral lands of MacIntyres, at Loch Etive between Oban and Taynuilt. A ceremony will be held at a cairn to the chiefs of Clan MacIntyre. In addition, the chief’s son will be at this gathering –the first time the family has returned to Scotland since emigrating to the US in 1822.            The pipes were handmade by a MacIntyre piper more than 800 years ago and are reputed to be the first pipes ever with two holes.According to legend, the MacIntyre piper had made his own chanter, and then in a dream a “faery” came to him and said: “Heat up your poker until it’s white hot and pierce the bottom of your chanter side to side and it will make the sweetest sounding pipes in Scotland.”These days, the chanter is the only part left of the original Faery Pipes and the holes do look as though they were burned in by a poker.Dr Alison Macintyre, organiser of the gathering, said: “The pipes have been out three times in 200 years. The last time was at the 2008 MacIntyre banquet when they were played by Archie McIntyre.            “The West Highland Museum is being very gracious in letting us use the Faery Pipes.“They are enchanted pipes and we are really excited to have them at the banquet and on the Sunday. We think that with having the Faery Pipes played at Glenoe with the son of the chief present, we should be able to stir up some ancestors.”Other highlights of the clan gathering include attending Taynuilt Highland Games, hikes, ceilidhs, boat tours and Gaelic workshops."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767571.1531416189!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie jeane freeman makes good start as health secretary","story":"        Scotland\u0026#8217s new Health Secretary appears to have got off to a flyer in terms of addressing the range of issues that weighed down her predecessor, Shona Robison, leading to her inevitable resignation and creating a siege mentalilty in the higher echelons of Holyrood.                 Jeane Freeman certainly brings a wealth of much-needed life experience and a degree of pragmatism to this most difficult of roles.            The former nurse has made all the right noises in terms of pledging to increase the speed at which the opaque health and social care services need to be brought together to address the country’s delayed-discharge problem – also known as bed-blocking – a nightmare that keeps people waiting in hospital when they’re fit enough to leave.            Here’s hoping she bangs a few bureaucratic heads together and manages to navigate through the coalition of local health boards and councils tasked with providing social care – a flagship idea from her own government built on an integration pipe dream. Good luck with that one Jeane. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon pays tribute to NHS staff as health service marks 70 yearsHowever, what may prove even more difficult for the nascent Cabinet Secretary is her vow to cut waiting times – a weekly Groundhog Day for Robison that proved to be her Achilles’ heel. A\u0026ampE waiting-time targets have been missed for a ninth month in a row and bed-blocking has risen eight per cent in a year. And those problems make up the tip of an iceberg that also includes almost 500 cancelled operations in May alone due to a lack of hospital capacity, an ongoing GP recruitment crisis and cancer treatment waiting times at their worst level in six years. Hopefully, Freeman doesn’t fall into the trap set by the Scottish Government’s own Information Services Division, which brings out a fresh raft of statistics every Tuesday to the delight of opposition parties who are provided with their weekly open goal. The early signs are that the new Health Secretary has no difficulty acknowledging there are problems in providing free healthcare to an ageing population and this is to be welcomed.             A situation developed over the course of Robison’s tenure in which the media would (over) report on the latest missed waiting time target, the likes of Scottish Labour’s Anas Sarwar would call for her head, and the under-fire Health Secretary would ignore the problem. Instead she would tell us, again, how much her Government had spent on improving the nation’s health. READ MORE: 500 operations cancelled due to ‘non-clinical’ reasonsNotable figures like the chair of the BMA in Scotland, Dr Peter Bennie, and a former chief medical officer, Sir Harry Burns, have consistently argued that waiting-time figures should be scrapped and are counter-productive to providing the best healthcare. This was blatantly ignored by Robsion and her Cabinet colleagues who developed the frankly annoying habit of constantly comparing statistics in Scotland to the rest of the UK, most notably England, in a politicisation of the health service that isn’t helpful to someone waiting 37 weeks for a knee replacement.  I may be over-optimistic but if Freeman can bring her own stamp of authority to the job and tackle critics head-on, while admitting problems exist, then we may be moving forward. The first publication of the monthly financial performance of all NHS health boards is an encouraging move towards greater transparency and Scotland’s GPs are on record as saying Freeman can help rebuild general practice. So, the goodwill appears to be there and the current mood music is favourable – let’s hope it lasts."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4767570.1531335460!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin honour of carrington contrasts with boris s ambition","story":"        The late Lord Carrington set an example that modern politicians would do well to follow, writes Tom Peterkin.                There was a fearful symmetry about the passing of Lord Carrington at a time when the British body politic is still reeling from the resignation of one of his successors as Foreign Secretary.            On the most superficial level, the late Lord Carrington and Boris Johnson would appear to have quite a bit in common.            When Mr Johnson quit on Monday, he became the first Foreign Secretary to resign since Lord Carrington left Margaret Thatcher’s Government over the invasion of the Falklands by Argentina in 1982. And on that same day, by a strange coincidence, Lord Carrington died at the age of 99.Both men, it could be said, come from traditional Tory backgrounds with Mr Johnson, an old Etonian and a product of Oxford University and the Bullingdon Club. Also an Etonian, Lord Carrington’s background looks distinctly anachronistic by today’s standards. But it was not that unusual in a bygone political era. He was a hereditary peer, who was never elected yet held some of the great offices of state. Both men, like many politicians, could be charm – even panache – itself. Although Mr Johnson’s unique breed of charm, based on oafish buffoonery, seems to have lost some of the lustre that made him such a draw on the Have I Got News for You circuit.But, the closer one looks at the two characters, the similarities are harder to find. The contrasts become more evident and are not greatly to Mr Johnson’s credit.            Yesterday’s fulsome obituaries of Lord Carrington recalled a patrician, paternalistic old-school “One Nation” Tory.READ MORE: Lord Carrington, who resigned over the Falklands, has died aged 99Unlike Mr Johnson’s gaffe-laden courting of celebrity and love of a photo opportunity, Lord Carrington was reticent to a fault when it came to self-promotion.He was so self-effacing that when writing his memoirs he didn’t bother to mention that he had won a Military Cross in the Second World War. Some thought it should have been a Victoria Cross. But when asked in an interview how he won it his answer was “pot luck”.            As a civilian member of a post-war generation, Mr Johnson has never had the chance to win a military decoration. But while Lord Carrington drove a tank on to a bridge over the Rhine and held the enemy at enormous personal risk, Mr Johnson is known for being filmed stranded on a zip-wire. They may have both resigned as Foreign Secretary, but the circumstances surrounding their departures could hardly be more different. Lord Carrington resigned as Foreign Secretary three days after Argentina invaded the Falklands. He felt he had no option other than to go, taking responsibility for the Foreign Office’s collective failure to foresee that trouble was on its way. “The nation feels there has been a disgrace,” he wrote in his memoirs. “Somebody must have been to blame. The disgrace must be purged. The person to purge it should be the minister in charge. That was me.”Despite Mrs Thatcher trying to persuade him not to go, he went and, to this day, it is seen as the act of an honourable man.            READ MORE: UK Government to start stockpiling food for no-deal BrexitHistory, one suspects, will not judge Mr Johnson quite so kindly. Given his ability to conjure up a memorable turn of phrase, it was no surprise that his resignation letter was a classic of its kind.In it, he complained that Brexit was “dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt”.Needless self-doubt is not something that has troubled Mr Johnson when it comes to his own ambition and it is difficult to escape the impression that his decision to quit was all about him. In fact, it would appear almost every political move he makes is all about him.The former Foreign Secretary’s critics believe his decision to embrace the Brexit cause before the 2016 EU referendum was more to do with his own Tory leadership ambitions than any matter of principle.Similarly, those self-same critics believe his departure to be driven by exactly the same motive – his own desire to end up in Number 10 Downing Street.Mrs May had installed Mr Johnson in one of the most crucial posts in her Cabinet on the basis that, as a Brexiteer, he should shoulder his share of the heavy lifting in these difficult times.In fact, Mr Johnson was more of a hindrance than a help – a disruptive influence at a time when politicians should be pulling together. In the world of Boris, as soon as David Davis leapt off Mrs May’s increasingly precarious ship, he had little option but to do likewise.Had Mr Davis been the only Cabinet minister to disembark that would have made him the only figurehead for disaffected Tory MPs to rally round and mount a challenge to Mrs May. Had Mr Johnson stayed in the Cabinet and been bound by collective responsibility (inasmuch as Boris Johnson can ever be bound by collective responsibility), Mr Davis would be given a free run when it came to stirring up trouble for the Prime Minister.Now Mr Johnson also lurks on the sidelines making himself a focal point for Tory dissatisfaction with the current leadership. We will never know how Lord Carrington would have viewed this state of affairs. But he did once say: “I had no desire whatsoever to lead the party – nor ever had.”Were Mr Johnson to say something similar, one suspects it would not bear much relation to the truth."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765629.1531383518!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll half of scots oppose second independence referendum","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations.

miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nThursday 12 Jul 2018 6:40

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.
