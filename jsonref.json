San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow. Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, Mr Corbyn replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.\u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. \u0027That surely would save a lot of lives,\u0027 he told the Andrew Marr Show. Meanwhile protests broke out today at the entrance gate of a British air base in Cyprus to denounce US-led airstrikes against the Assad regime in Syria. Around 350 demonstrators, from communist organisations in Greece and Cyprus, gathered in front of RAF Akrotiri where four Tornado warplanes took off to take part in the missile strike. Protest leader Akis Poullos said they were demanding the closure of RAF Akrotiri, with signs condemning the \u0027NATO killers\u0027 after the attack.  Putin criticised Washington and its allies for attacking without waiting for inspectors from the international chemical weapons watchdog group to visit Douma, just outside Damascus, saying Russian military experts had found no trace of the attack. The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons  Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesBarzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack. A total of 76 missiles pummeled this site alone. Smoke still lingered well after the attack that happened in the early morning darkness of 4amA Russian motion in the UN Security Council to condemn the airstrikes was rejected with only China and Bolivia joining Russia to vote in favour, as U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley promised the country was ready for another strike if Assad crossed the chemical weapons \u0027red line\u0027 in the future.Moscow\u0027s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, said: \u0027A pre-designed scenario is being implemented. Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.\u0027 Scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night in retaliation for President Assad\u0027s chemical weapons attack on the rebel enclave of Douma on April 7.Some 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing.             Speaking on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show today, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the strikes were merely aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons           Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn branded the UK\u0027s air strikes \u0027legally questionable\u0027, forcing the Government to publish detailed legal advice justifying the bombings. Today on the Andrew Marr show (pictured) he called for a \u0027war powers\u0027 lawThe Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime\u0027s chemical weapons program back \u0027years\u0027. At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. All of the US aircraft returned safely to base after the attack. Gen. McKenzie did not say where the Lancer B-1 Bombers had flown from but other officials suggested they were deployed from an airbase in Qatar.       A Syrian soldier films the damage at the site of the Barzah Scientific Research Center in Damascus on Saturday morning after it was annihilated by 76 missiles            Smoke was still billowing from the site on Saturday morning, hours after the 4am air and sea missile attack             Soldiers were putting out the flames and smoke on Saturday morning as US officials celebrated the attack and said \u0027mission accomplished\u0027 \u0027We met our objective. We hit our target. It was mission accomplished,\u0027 a Pentagon spokesperson said on Saturday, repeating President Trump\u0027s tweet earlier in the day.Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria\u0027s suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, \u0027Mission Accomplished!\u0027 - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.\u0027The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,\u0027 Pence told reporters, noting there were \u0027no reported civilian casualties.\u0027He also had a warning for Russia: \u0027Our message to Russia is, \u0027you\u0027re on the wrong side of history,\u0027 \u0027 Pence also said. \u0027It\u0027s time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. \u0027You\u0027re known by the company you keep.\u0027Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes. Diane Abbott: Russia\u0027s a greater threat to world peace than USShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Germaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave HarryUK Tornado warplanes take off from Cyprus before Syrian airstrikeDestroyed research lab caught on video after US strikes DamascusFrench armed forces strike the chemical arsenal of Syrian regimeFour Tornados from RAF Akrotiri conduct air strikes on SyriaTheresa May explains why the UK has joined airstrikes in Syria\u0027We need to remain in the long term\u0027: Emmanuel Macron on SyriaDamascus researcher lab destroyed after being hit by airstrikes  Satellite images show the Barzah Research Center, the main target, before and after the missile attack which took place at 4am local time on Saturday, 9pm EST on Friday. 76 missiles pummeled this site alone    The second target was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles    The third target, Him Shinshar CW Bunker, was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missiles             This graphic issued by the Pentagon on Saturday illustrates how the attacks unfolded from air and sea.

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed. Our goal in Syria is to defeat ISIS....but Assad\u0027s actions were beyond the pale. We do not seek conflict in Syria but we cannot allow such grievous violations of international law,\u0027 she said. \u0027We will not stand by passively while Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, ignores international law.\u0027Iran condemned the Western strikes on Syria, saying no country has a right to take punitive measures against another \u0027beyond international procedures.\u0027The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Iran\u0027s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying that Iran had warned about the possibility that \u0027terrorist groups\u0027 were behind the alleged chemical attack that triggered the strikes.

Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!\u0027\u0027So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won\u0027t be anything, or anyone, even close!\u0027 he tweeted.The phrase recalled a similar claim associated with President George W. Bush following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years. Russia proposed a motion at the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the airstrikes, but this was rejected with only Russia, China and Bolivia voting in favour.   Singer Azealia Banks in tears as she says she was raped\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaGermaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave HarryDestroyed research lab caught on video after US strikes DamascusFrench armed forces strike the chemical arsenal of Syrian regimeFour Tornados from RAF Akrotiri conduct air strikes on SyriaTheresa May explains why the UK has joined airstrikes in Syria\u0027We need to remain in the long term\u0027: Emmanuel Macron on SyriaDamascus researcher lab destroyed after being hit by airstrikesUK Tornado warplanes take off from Cyprus before Syrian airstrike      Trump hailed a \u0027perfectly executed strike\u0027 just hours after launching a series of attacks on Syria.

But he failed to call UK Prime Minister Theresa May in the early stages of the operation, giving the French leader the opportunity to claim France is America\u0027s leading ally in Europe.  Vladimir Putin condemned Friday\u0027s strikes as an \u0027act of aggression\u0027 that will worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria and have a \u0027destructive influence on the entire system of international relations.But Trump has vowed to carry out more if Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime dares to use chemical weapons again.

Today Mr Corbyn demanded a \u0027war powers\u0027 law to ban the Prime Minister from taking military action without a Commons vote.The official legal advice claimed \u0027the UK is permitted under international law, on an exceptional basis, to take measures in order to alleviate overwhelming humanitarian suffering\u0027. Mrs May will face MPs tomorrow. Asked if there were any circumstances in which he would back air strikes in Syria, the Labour leader replied: \u0027I can only countenance involvement in Syria if there is a UN authority behind it.\u0027If we could get to a process in the UN where you get to a ceasefire, you get to a political solution, you then may well get to a situation where there could be a UN force established to enforce that ceasefire. \u0027That surely would save a lot of lives,\u0027 he told the Andrew Marr Show.  The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons  Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesSome 75 people, including children, are said to have died when the Syrian regime used chlorine gas and another nerve agent in Douma last Saturday.Aid workers told how chlorine could be smelled in the air and victims were found with foam in their mouth and with burning eyes.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter\u0027s Square that he is `\u0027deeply disturbed\u0027 by the international community\u0027s failure to come up with a common response to the crisis in Syria and other parts of the world.\u0027Despite the tools available to the international community, it is difficult to agree on a common action toward peace in Syria or other regions of the world,\u0027 the Pope told a crowd of 30,000 after his traditional Sunday blessing. Assad continues to deny using any chemical weapons, telling visiting Russian politicians today that Western air strikes against his country were accompanied by a campaign of \u0027lies\u0027 and misinformation at the UN. But in response to the deaths, scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night.The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Centre which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program.The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by 22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles. The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities. Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack.

Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027He also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over.

It was mission accomplished,\u0027 White said on Saturday, repeating President Trump\u0027s tweet earlier in the day.Hours after Trump hailed the missile strike targeting the Syria\u0027s suspected chemical weapons - tweeting, \u0027Mission Accomplished!\u0027 - Vice President Mike Pence defended the president while building support among U.S. allies for the joint strikes with Britain and France on Saturday.\u0027The objective of the mission the commander in chief gave our military forces and our allies was completely accomplished - with swift professionalism,\u0027 Pence told reporters, noting there were \u0027no reported civilian casualties.\u0027He also had a warning for Russia: \u0027Our message to Russia is, \u0027you\u0027re on the wrong side of history,\u0027 \u0027 Pence also said. \u0027It\u0027s time for Russia to get the message President Trump delivered last night. \u0027You\u0027re known by the company you keep.\u0027Russia has military forces, including air defences, in several areas of Syria to support President Assad in his long war against anti-government rebels.Confusion arose over the extent to which Washington warned Moscow in advance. The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes. Diane Abbott: Russia\u0027s a greater threat to world peace than USShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13Singer Azealia Banks in tears as she says she was raped\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaGermaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave Harry\u0027We need to remain in the long term\u0027: Emmanuel Macron on SyriaUK Tornado warplanes take off from Cyprus before Syrian airstrikeDestroyed research lab caught on video after US strikes DamascusFrench armed forces strike the chemical arsenal of Syrian regimeDiane Abbott: Russia\u0027s a greater threat to world peace than USShocking video shows the inside of a hoarder\u0027s propertyParents tie up \u0027child sex predator\u0027 targeting daughter, 13\u0027Our future is at stake\u0027: Patrick Stewart\u0027s bid to block BrexitSinger Azealia Banks in tears as she says she was raped\u0027We have to take every possible precaution\u0027: Boris on RussiaGermaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave Harry\u0027We need to remain in the long term\u0027: Emmanuel Macron on SyriaDamascus researcher lab destroyed after being hit by airstrikesUK Tornado warplanes take off from Cyprus before Syrian airstrikeSatellite images show the Barzah Research Center, the main target, before and after the missile attack which took place at 4am local time on Saturday, 9pm EST on Friday. 76 missiles pummeled this site alone  The second target was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles  The third target, Him Shinshar CW Bunker, was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missiles           This graphic issued by the Pentagon on Saturday illustrates how the attacks unfolded from air and sea.

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed.

We have acted because it is in our national interest to do so.‘It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria – and to uphold and defend the global consensus that these weapons should not be used.

Jeremy Corbyn again questioned the legality of the UK’s role in the 105-missile strike – and called for legislation to stop military action without MPs’ support‘Furthermore, there were clearly attempts to block any proper investigation, as we saw with the Russian veto at the UN earlier in the week.

There is broad based international support for the action we have taken.’Mr Corbyn told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show that legislation was needed.The Labour leader said: ‘There is precedent over previous interventions when Parliament has had a vote.‘I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.’Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said any such law would not apply to urgent cases such as ‘when we are under attack or the prime minister has been kidnapped’.But Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, the Prime Minister’s deputy, said there were ‘no plans’ for legislation. The decision on whether there will be a vote – on a motion saying ‘the House has considered this’ – is technically a matter for the Speaker.On Saturday, Government Whips asked Tory MPs if they backed the action – with some asked if they would back Mrs May in a vote. One MP said: ‘The feeling is nobody will vote against her now it’s done and it’s punitive and there’s been no consequences to our troops.’Yesterday it emerged Chief Whip Julian Smith had emailed MPs putting them on a three-line whip for tomorrow afternoon.

One amendment could make the UK remain in the EU customs union. This would make it impossible to agree trade deals around the world.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, an architect of the Leave victory, dismissed Sir Patrick’s remarks, saying the UK would ‘boldly go’ into areas of the world it has neglected.When Andrew Marr suggested on his BBC1 show yesterday that British trade negotiators might be confronted by ‘alien spacecraft waiting to zap us’ in these far-flung places, the Foreign Secretary assured him that they were ‘friendly, wonderful places where we can renew old friendships, rebuild relationships and develop fantastic new free-trade deals’.In any case, Brexiteers have little to fear from the intrepid Captain Picard.

It made him reckless. He got into a silly alcoholic argument at a party and burst out: \u0027I\u0027m a member of the Communist Party — have been for years!\u0027This wasn\u0027t even true. He\u0027d never been a party member, not even in his radical Left-wing days at Cambridge.

When he heard of this outburst, he could see that his comrade\u0027s days were drastically numbered, and he contacted Moscow for instructions on how to get him out.He then briefed his fellow spy and Cambridge recruit, Guy Burgess, to warn Maclean that he was going to be rumbled any day, and to set up an escape plan.Meanwhile, the spy-catchers were getting closer as they eliminated other suspects. To the incredulity of George Carey-Foster, head of Foreign Office security, the spotlight was shifting to Maclean.Carey-Foster found it hard to believe that such a trusted friend and colleague could really be the guilty party, yet the evidence increasingly pointed to him. An appalled Foreign Office had to accept that Maclean — the brilliant man many of them had expected to run the show as Permanent Secretary one day, the star they had hitched themselves to and protected, had to be Homer.          In May 1951, Maclean left the house (pictured) on SurreyKent border and travelled to France with fellow spy Guy Burgess before defecting to the Soviet UnionThey were paralysed with indecision about how precisely to bring him in. They were also too embarrassed to name Maclean, one of their own, to the Americans.The only action agreed at this point was to put a tap on his phone and a tail on his movements. His mother\u0027s phone was also tapped, as was the one in the consulting room of the psychoanalyst he was seeing about his alcoholism.But a decision was made to hold off actually doing anything more until either concrete evidence could be obtained that would hold up in court or the suspect could be interrogated and confess. During this window of official inactivity, the most senior spy ever detected inside the British government was, amazingly, allowed to go about his business unhindered.He lunched with old friends in the respectable establishment surroundings of the Garrick, Army and Navy and Travellers clubs. He had tea in the office. And, all the while, the watchers from MI5\u0027s surveillance unit, A4, loitered on street corners and silently followed him.Maclean himself must have suspected his nemesis was getting closer. Sensitive files were being kept from him his superiors seemed awkward around him there was the echo of the tap on his telephone.Clearly, he was worried. An old acquaintance he ran into thought him shabby and morose, \u0027untalkative, with his hands thrust deep into his tweed coat pockets and his shoulders hunched\u0027. He seemed defeated, exhausted by the worlds which he had strived to straddle for so long.Elsewhere in London, Burgess was in crisis talks with Anthony Blunt, another highly placed Cambridge alumnus working for the Soviet Union, who was embedded in MI5.          Kim Philby, the wily undercover master-spy who had recruited Maclean as a Soviet agent, briefed his fellow spy and Cambridge recruit, Guy Burgess (pictured), to warn Maclean that he was going to be rumbled any day, and to set up an escape planBlunt passed a message to Moscow that if Maclean was arrested and questioned, he would almost certainly blab, putting the whole network in danger.So far, Moscow had hesitated about getting Maclean out: now the instruction came back: \u0027We agree to your organising Maclean\u0027s defection. We will receive him here.\u0027Burgess met Maclean for a drink at the Reform Club, where he told him that MI5 were onto to him. Maclean wasn\u0027t surprised. \u0027I\u0027m being followed by the dicks,\u0027 he said, pointing out two men in the street jingling their coins in a policeman-like manner. \u0027I\u0027m expecting a summons any day.\u0027But he was reluctant to defect, abandoning his wife Melinda and his family, especially since she was pregnant. The word came back from Moscow: he had no choice.Philby then sent a coded message telling them there was no time to lose. Get on with it.For the next few days, Maclean found it in himself to act normally. He renewed his railway season ticket and left his trousers at the dry-cleaner\u0027s for collection.In terms of escape plans, it helped that the watchers from MI5 chose not to follow him in the evenings or at weekends. Their presence in the Home Counties village where he lived would be too obvious. They saw him off from Victoria each night, then headed home.From Moscow came a new order: that Burgess, increasingly a liability because of his own excessive behaviour, would not only help Maclean to \u0027exfiltrate\u0027 but go with him for at least some of the way.The problem was how to get the two of them out, given that it was a safe bet the airports and ports would be watched. Moscow toyed with \u0027that classic spy-novel device, a submarine appearing at a discreet rendezvous somewhere along the coast\u0027, but time was too short.          Donald Maclean with his wife Melinda Marling and his two sons Ronald and Fergus in the 50sIt was Blunt who came up with the solution. There were cruise ships that left the Channel ports on a Friday night, then put in for brief stops for meals and shopping in France and the Channel Islands before returning on Sunday evening. As passengers were deemed not really ever to leave Britain, passport checks were virtually non-existent.Thursday, May 24, was another frantic day at the top of the Foreign Office, with furtive high-level meetings that ended in still more dithering about Maclean\u0027s guilt. They were still very cautious about condemning such a trusted colleague — and there was also the political consideration that managing how they broke the news to their opposite numbers in America was crucial.Not to tell them would be a breach of their intelligence-sharing protocols but nor did they want the story, which would be a sensation, to leak.A timetable was drawn up to put off his interrogation for a month, partly to give them time to deal with their opposite numbers in the U.S., and partly because Melinda was due to give birth on June 17, enabling them to search their house, if necessary, while she was in the nursing home.The next day — Maclean\u0027s 38th birthday — he went to work as usual and rang his mother to invite her for lunch. She had a previous engagement, she told him, and couldn\u0027t make it. She was never to see him again.He lunched with old friends instead — champagne and oysters at Wheelers in Soho — but was \u0027steady on his feet\u0027, according to the watcher tailing him when he went through the Foreign Office doors for the last time at 3pm.As he left that evening, he told colleagues he wouldn\u0027t be in for a few days because \u0027something has cropped up\u0027 . That left Sir Roger Makins, the deputy under-secretary, suspicious. He was in the know about Maclean and rang the head of security to alert him.But there was no reply and, running late for a social engagement, he concluded that, as Maclean was under surveillance by the Security Service, there was no need to raise the alarm.No one in the Foreign Office had been told the surveillance teams knocked off when Maclean took his train home. The team\u0027s last sighting of him was recorded as \u0027after a drink, he boarded the 6.10 pm train for the Whitsun Bank Holiday\u0027.And, officially, that was the last that was ever seen of him.At home that evening, the family dined on a special ham Melinda had spent the day preparing, and birthday cake. To Melinda\u0027s annoyance, a man she did not know arrived, introduced as \u0027Roger Styles\u0027. It was Guy Burgess.Dinner was a chatty, \u0027normal\u0027 meal, with no one showing any sign of strain. Afterwards, Maclean went upstairs and packed a double-handled Gladstone bag because, he told her, the two of them had to go away on business. He might be away a night or two.

The government announced last month that it was giving a further £100million to councils to help repair potholes and protect local roads from severe weather (stock image)The Association said £1million would be spent per mile on strategic road networks such as motorways from 2015-20 - compared to just £21,000 a mile for local roads.There are also concerns that deteriorating rural roads will make access for the emergency services harder and response times longer - potentially putting lives at risk.Predominantly rural areas have a fire and rescue service incident response times of 10 minutes 37 seconds compared to seven minutes 43 seconds in urban areas.Jeremy Atkins, an NFU Mutual senior agent in Devon, told Farmers Weekly that rural roads were the \u0027arteries of the countryside\u0027 and it would have serious implications if they became unusable.\u0027Other rural road users such as cyclists and horse riders are also at risk,\u0027 he said.\u0027They may need to take sudden avoiding action when they encounter a pothole or may ride, unsuspecting, into deep potholes which are filled with rainwater.\u0027The government announced last month that it was giving a further £100million to councils to help repair potholes and protect local roads from severe weather.Transport secretary Chris Grayling said the money would help repair almost 2m potholes as well as help protect the roads from any future severe weather.This was on top of £75million in government funding already given to councils from the Pothole Action Fund this year, as well as an extra £46m or highways authorities announced before Christmas.Mr Grayling said: \u0027We have seen an unusually prolonged spell of freezing weather, which has caused damage to our local roads.\u0027We are giving councils even more funding to help repair their roads so all road users can enjoy their journeys without having to dodge potholes.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/21/4B26705D00000578-5615843-Windsor_Castle_in_the_hazy_sunshine_taken_from_the_top_of_The_Ai-a-4_1523738172334.jpg","title":"UK WEATHER Britain bask hottest April day 10 years week","story":"    An \u0027African plume\u0027 is set to bring highs of 26C across the UK next week, sparking safety fears for those taking part in the London marathon          Windsor Castle in the hazy sunshine taken from the top of The Air Forces Memorial Building, in Runnymede, Surrey, on Saturday      A 1,500mile wide front of hot air originating in north Africa will be bringing the hotter temperatures, arriving on Monday before increasing later on in the week.The African plume differs to the Spanish plume the UK experienced last summer which brought with it temperatures of 25C.

The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed.You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before.These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond.Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points.The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now ided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords.The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way.Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn.You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality.The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway.Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.”But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters.There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky.It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour.Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time.The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place.Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape.Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good\u0026nbspstaff.Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day.Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users.It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank,\u0026nbspgiving almost no clue of their busy inner lives.Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions?For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic.Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume\u0026nbspthat the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between\u0026nbspwhat was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become\u0026nbspmore stark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64ed79f8e87c5a5e32b76c40cd936f743679d6ae/0_62_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=91a6ffe8f98ed751c92362f3cb4b7e7a 1240w","title":"daniel kalder picks five books about dictators","story":"Stalin’s claustrophobic life at the Kremlin, Mussolini’s failed campaign against Mickey Mouse, and how Jean-Paul Sartre became one of Mao’s ‘useful idiots’Although Stalin was for decades the supreme leader of the largest country on Earth, he saw little of his empire, rarely venturing beyond the walls of the Kremlin. Instead, he experienced the USSR primarily as a series of texts that landed on his desk each day. In Stalin’s World: Dictating the Soviet Order, Sarah Davies and James Harris reconstruct his claustrophobic, insular reality through a close study of his archive, shining a spotlight on the daily business of running a massive totalitarian state. It paints a portrait of the dictator as monstrous, paper-shuffling super-bureaucrat.RJB Bosworth takes a very different approach in Mussolini’s Italy. Via an astonishing accumulation of detail, he immerses the reader in a reconstruction of daily life under the fascist dictatorship. The results are surprising: I did not know that a quarter of Italy’s Jewish population were members of the National Fascist Party by the 1930s, nor that Topolino (Mickey Mouse) was regarded as a corrupting influence on Italian youth. And yet Mussolini’s own children read comics starring the American rodent even in Il Duce’s own household, his political experiment was a failure.Stalin’s World is very dense and Mussolini’s Italy is very long – common characteristics of books about dictatorships. Simon Leys’ Chinese Shadows has just over 200 elegantly written pages, and yet cuts to the heart of Mao’s Cultural Revolution with precision. Leys exposed the destructive evil of Mao’s regime at a time when “useful idiots” ranging from Jean-Paul Sartre to Shirley MacLaine were singing its praises in the west. His narrative fuses insights from his own travels in China with profound but lightly worn erudition. One moment Leys is discussing Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse‑tung, the next he is reaching back to its 14th‑century precursor, the Ming Ta kao.Latin America has endured many tyrants, spawning the genre of the dictator novel. Of all the celebrated examples of the form, I am most fascinated by Augusto Roa Bastos’s I, the Supreme. The 1974 novel provides a fictionalised account of the 19th- century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco, AKA Dr Francia, AKA “the Supreme”, who ruled the nation between 1814 and 1840. The Paraguayan author’s interest in the Supreme was not purely historical Bastos wrote the novel while Paraguay was suffering under another dictator, Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda. However, the book is no simple allegory, it is also a profound meditation on power and language.And now for something completely different: Riad Sattouf’s The Arab of the Future. We know personality cults are strange, but that strangeness looks different from the perspective of a child. Sattouf experienced both Gaddafi’s Libya and Hafez al-Assad’s Syria while still a small boy. Kids don’t spend a lot of time reflecting on totalitarianism, but they do form strong impressions. His simple depictions of living in an almost-abandoned building for expatriates in Libya, or of watching Assad praying on TV are the kind of banal micro-details that would lose their significance in written prose. Captured in the panels of a cartoon strip, however, they attain a luminous resonance that lingers long after you’ve finished the book.• Dictator Literature: A History of Despots Through Their Writing by Daniel Kalder is published by Oneworld in the UK and is available in the US as The Infernal Library: On Dictators, the Books They Wrote, and Other Catastrophes of Literacy (Henry Holt)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a5905e2101936af2916537f04e44566a04e5d04/0_30_1835_1101/master/1835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8bb25986c3a97216943a4707442ff304 1240w","title":"the people vs tech review jamie bartlett silicon valley","story":"The latest treatise on technology taking over our lives suggests democratic systems are incompatible with the digital age, but the theory lacks coherenceThere is a clear, algorithmic formula for writing books about technology and society in 2018. Authors are generally required to be male, their documented personal journey must have been from that of techno-optimist to techno-sceptic to techno-panicker. There must be an urgent existential threat to either democracy or humanity lurking in the code base of Silicon Valley companies. The intractable crisis is not so profound, however, that it cannot be solved by a hail of partially thought-through remedies tacked on in the appendix.This recipe is producing a growing body of what might be termed “techlash” literature: the backlash against Silicon Valley and its seemingly unstoppable accretion of wealth, data and cultural and political capital. Where once we might have read expansive works of science fiction creating vivid and ambiguous alternative realities to help us navigate the future, now we have worrisome documentaries of threats so present they have often played out by the time the galley hits the review pile. In the last year several notable techlash titles have appeared, including Franklin Foer’s World Without Mind, Tim Wu’s The Attention Merchants and Jonathan Taplin’s Move Fast and\u0026nbspBreak Things.Jamie Bartlett, a technology journalist and the head of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at the thinktank Demos, brings another title to the genre, his book having all the requisites of an apocalyptic techno-driven scenario, this time with a promise to solve it. The People vs Tech: How the Internet Is Killing Democracy (and How We Save It) is a lively read, which attempts to pull a grand theory out of the current political crises surrounding the surprise victories of Donald Trump and the Brexit campaign, Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and the unauthorised laundering of millions of personal data profiles. Although Bartlett’s tone is unusually upbeat for someone facing an imminent democalypse, his meta-thesis is far darker than those of authors who simply moan that the internet has ruined everything. Bartlett lays out an argument that democracy is being rendered obsolete by an increasingly quantified society, nudged gently toward surrendering its political agency to smarterdecision-making machines. The public sphere is obscure and corrupted, the middle classes are facing robotic unemployment, and authoritarians are stepping into the void left by our declining institutions.Bartlett argues that a series of threats, including automation and artificial intelligence applications, and the algorithmic remaking of publics by data aggregators such as Facebook, will erode the conditions necessary for democracy to thrive.“At a deep level these two grand systems – technology and democracy – are locked in a bitter conflict,” writes Bartlett. “They are products of completely different eras and run according to different rules and principles.” At one point Bartlett makes the unsubstantiated assertion that “democracy is analogue rather than digital” – in other words, slow, deliberative and grounded in physical space. Each of Bartlett’s six conditions for functioning democracy – active citizens, shared culture, free elections, stakeholder equality, competitive and civic freedom, and trust in authority – he argues, are either already subsumed in bots and distraction or are about to be worn away by a combination of self-driving cars and programmatic\u0026nbspadvertising.The theory that modern democracy is unfit for the digital age is a fascinating provocation, as the opacity of our political communications systems and asymmetry of social media platforms allow for autocratic and populist messages to thrive. The evidence stretches beyond Trump and Brexit and into both large countries such as Russia and China and aggressively authoritarian leaders in smaller countries from the Philippines to Hungary. After decades of western-style democracy being in the ascendancy it is suddenly in retreat.Bartlett could have mined a fascinating book from just one subject on his laundry list of threats to democracy. But for all six he struggles to lash the billowing themes together into a coherent whole. And often his arguments are just infuriatingly inconsistent. On one page, for instance, he describes algorithms as running autonomously of any human control, yet he later refers to the implicit human bias baked into the same systems. He is convinced that the powerful narcotic of smartphone apps will somehow anaesthetise the general population, isolating them from civic engagement. However, instances of collective action and protest, particularly in the US, are higher than they have been for decades. His major criticisms revolve largely around the supply side of the equation – monopolistic institutions hoarding our data – but he rarely acknowledges that the demand side has a role to play, too. His depiction of the population as dazed, confused and addicted by Silicon Valley’s psychological trickery just does not feel grounded in fact.He rightly characterises journalism as a weakened element of the public commons and worries that questions such as “What new injustices are tech creating?” are extremely difficult to answer, and that the complexity of investigating platform power will just be too expensive or difficult: “We are therefore in the unenviable position where the tech companies could become even less subject to the investigations that could keep their growing power in check.”This might become true. However, Mark Zuckerberg sweated through two hearings on Capitol Hill only because he was dragged there by the work of journalists and academics unearthing the Cambridge Analytica scandal. We owe our entire knowledge of the current dog’s breakfast of failures in the information ecosystem to independent academic researchers and investigative journalists.As a policy wonk and journalist, Bartlett has more insight when writing about election processes and political communications than when he ranges further into the technical landscape. The details of the dynamics during the Trump campaign are particularly compelling. Although not new, and written about at exhaustive length in the US press, the alchemy of micro-targeting in close campaigns such as the 2016 presidential election is the strongest evidence he has to support his overarching claim that democracy is, in fact, screwed.Unfortunately, the book itself falls foul of the dynamics of the very systems Bartlett critiques. Book deadlines, like democracy, are analogue, slow and deliberative, while the subject matter of this book changes every day. Early on, Bartlett writes extensively about the use of targeting data in the Trump campaign and interviews Alexander Nix, the chief executive officer of Cambridge Analytica, but he is missing the final and most exciting part of the story. He was clearly pressed by an anxious editor to retrofit events into footnotes and updated mentions (so the Parkland shootings in Florida make an awkward appearance but Cambridge Analytica’s exposure and disgrace is left undone).This is perhaps the most frustrating thing about the profusion of treatises inviting us to peer into the techno-abyss: they could have arrived a little earlier. All the evidence for supporting arguments of technological overreach, a muddied public sphere and a communications ecosystem it is impossible to parse has been available for years. And yet were it not for Donald Trump’s presidency I\u0026nbspseriously doubt we would be having these discussions even now.The original techlash authors, such as Evgeny Morozov (The Net Delusion) or Jaron Lanier (You Are Not a Gadget), were ahead of their time in terms of one set of white men complaining about the empowerment of another set of white men. For the women and minorities who never enjoyed the full advantages of a free press, functioning democracies and elite positions in society, the ongoing oppression of an out-of-control technocracy seems less of a surprise. • The People vs Tech by Jamie Bartlett is published by Ebury Press (£8.99).

But Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, which accounts for £1 in every £3 spent in the UK, said the bad weather did not entirely explain the lacklustre spending in March.“We are in the midst of a dip in consumer confidence and this – coupled with other economic factors – is causing shoppers to continue to restrain themselves,” Antipof said. “High street sales suffered once again however, it is also noteworthy that e-commerce spend fell for the first time in 10 months, and by its fastest rate since 2012.”The difficult conditions will pile pressure on retailers already suffering from rising costs and consumers’ caution in the face of food price inflation and a squeeze on their spare cash.Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look and Carpetright are closing dozens of stores in order to restructure. Mothercare and Homebase are also considering closing large numbers of stores. Brexit-fuelled inflation and a rise in business rates has made life tougher, just as the industry is battling to adapt to a switch to shopping online and a preference for spending on experiences such as holidays or meals out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4977df3c64b8f5e4e757e1481cefd2d12196ee/0_0_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=420ce6a15e495d77d7eec72dcea2bda4 2600w","title":"london fields lido did saving a pool mean losing a community","story":"When campaigners successfully reopened the open-air pool in Hackney, they had no idea it would turn their community into something unrecognisableOne summer day in 2003, the local residents of Hackney, north-east London, were invited on a tour of the abandoned site of London Fields Lido. Although closed since 1988, the pool was not empty. Squatters had moved in, and held raves in the old pool tank – much to the annoyance of campaigners, who had cleaned it up for community events. The tour was to introduce locals to a bold new redevelopment plan for the lido: to reopen the pool, install a new cafe and evict the squatters.As the locals were shown around, the squatters sat in front of the changing rooms, where purple buddleia had begun to grow above the doors, and watched them. One woman on the tour, meanwhile, enquired whether she would have to swim if she wanted a coffee. It was a moment that seemed to capture the extremes of life in Hackney: young homeless people facing eviction, and an affluent new resident who saw an opportunity for a latte. Campaigners, however, remember the 18 years spent trying to resurrect it. When the pool closed for refurbishment last year, it stayed closed for four months longer than expected, causing locals to anxiously recall the fate of Haggerston Baths a mile away. The grade II-listed building closed in 2000 following a 16-year battle against the forces of development an unhappy ending for local campaigners.Indeed, you could write an alternative history of Hackney through the story of its pools. As well as London Fields and Haggerston Baths there was the catastrophe of Clissold Leisure Centre, which cost £45m –nearly seven times the original budget – and closed in 2003 for four years following a flood, just 18 months after it had opened. There is also the furore over Britannia Leisure Centre, which despite a £300,000 facelift in 2016 is to be demolished as part of a major redevelopment that will include a leisure centre with three swimming pools, a school and 480 new homes – only 80 of which will be classed as affordable. Victoria Park was once home to the largest modern lido in London. It was demolished in 1990 to make way for a car park. The closure of pools has been disastrous for Hackney schoolchildren. In 2006, a feasibility study on Haggerston Baths found that four out of the five secondary schools surveyed did not provide any form of swimming, due to lack of funding or facilities. At one point in the mid-noughties there was only one swimming pool with lanes to serve a population of more than 200,000. In the last decade-and-a-half, the gap has grown more visible, as Hackney has become one of the hippest destinations in London, with its chic restaurants, boutiques and cafes. On a hot summer weekend, there are so many people in the park that it looks as if there’s a festival underway. And at the heart of it all is London Fields Lido. Caroline, who serves freshly baked croissants and toasties at a kiosk in the lido, has lived in the neighbourhood for 33 years and has seen the new arrivals flood in. Her flat overlooks the park and she complains about the impact of the crowds – the shortage of toilets and the noise. She regrets the loss of community spirit, and feels that, with rare exceptions, the incomers don’t know how to be good neighbours. ‘I think they’re afraid, they don’t want to mix,” she says. “People walk past you as though you’ve got green wires coming out of your head.”  The original Lido is an island beach resort in Venice. It became the popular name for open air pools in the 1930s, bringing continental holiday glamour to gloomy British summers during a boom for building outdoor pools. It was with this ambition that London Fields Lido opened in 1932.  As Janet Smith reveals in her very enjoyable history Liquid Assets, the fashion for lido-building was driven by an egalitarian ethos. When Morecambe’s open air pool opened in 1936, Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, declared: “Bathing reduces rich and poor, high and low, to a common standard of enjoyment and health. When we get down to swimming, we get down to democracy.” London County Council (LCC) was particularly zealous in its lido-building programme. Herbert Morrison, leader of the LCC in the late 30s, wanted London to be a “city of lidos”, with every citizen within walking distance of an open air pool.Margaret Thatcher signalled the end for public swimming with her war on local government spending. London Fields Lido was just one of the many casualties in the 1980s as councils cut their budgets.Mike Martin remembers standing in front of the bulldozer at 7am. He was part of a campaign to save London Fields Lido, which had halted the council’s plans to demolish the pool – but he and his fellow campaigners were then tipped off that the demolition team had somehow not got the message and had turned up to do the job anyway. The lido was saved in the nick of time.In their determination to resurrect London Fields Lido, campaigners including Martin joined forces with architects and the Environment Trust, and presented plans for the pool to the community in 2003. Hackney council finally agreed to fund the renovation in 2004.The transformation that has taken place in the neighbourhood since was initially driven by campaigners seeking to regenerate the borough – not only at the lido, but also a few minutes away on Broadway Market, a street below London Fields that was once a drovers’ route into the city. It hosts a hugely successful Saturday market launched by local residents and traders in 2004, two years before the pool reopened. Time Out calls the street “a promenade for the East End fashion set”.Many people are boosters of the newly revitalised area. “What does it say about the last 30-odd years of government in this country that people from other parts of the country are travelling down to London to spend the weekend in a park?” asks Hackney councillor Jon Burke, who is responsible for energy, sustainability and community services, including lidos. “Where have we gone so badly wrong that Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Hull, don’t offer this standard of living to everybody?” For some of the campaigners who kickstarted the regeneration, however, there is a rueful recognition of the role they may have played in changing the character of the neighbourhood. Liz Veitch, a retired teacher, says that when she first moved to London Fields 25 years ago, she could almost see the tumbleweed blowing down Broadway Market, a street that had once been home to a popular East End market. Hackney council made a number of failed attempts to revive it, but it was only when local residents took on the challenge that the market succeeded. Her late husband, journalist Andrew Veitch, played an instrumental role in the market’s success, setting up a community interest company that he ran for 10 years. The revival of the market was a catalyst that helped transform London Fields into a destination for hipsters, swiftly followed by the reopening of the lido.“In the beginning it was local people trying to make what was a beaten up area a bit more attractive,” says Veitch. “People who moved in here, like us, felt they ought to do more in the community. I would say that the people buying into this area do not seem to share the same sense of community. The youngsters buying or renting these flats are too busy trying to live, but also there is an air of entitlement amongst amongst some of the more affluent members of the next generation. Thatcher’s children if you like. They don’t get involved here. When we were growing up, it was a mantra that was part of our upbringing - if you’re in a community you join in and do what you can.” When Hackney Council began selling off properties in Broadway Market at the start of the millennium, resulting in the eviction of popular local independent businesses, there was a huge campaign to stop the demolition of Francesca’s Cafe, run by Tony Platia for 30 years. Gentrification became a very dirty word, as Hackney council was accused of betraying the neighbourhood and getting into bed with the property developers. “The lido does not reflect the demography of Hackney,” says Josephine Bacon, who runs the lido user group. “It’s very white, it’s very middle class, it’s quite young. Hackney and Better’s advertisements promote swimming for everyone, saying come and join in, and they have photographs of black people on their posters and banners. Of course there are some black people there, but hardly any. And probably not very many unemployed or low income swimmers either. And I’m not really sure why - whether because it’s too expensive or because London Fields has become a chi-chi area. I don’t know what can be done to make it more inclusive.” It’s a problem that goes beyond Hackney. Swim England’s research in 2015 revealed that ethnic minorities are half as likely to know how to swim as white members of the population. The closure of Hackney’s pools in the noughties may also have had an impact on the next generation of swimmers. It may, however, be true that the number of options is increasing: London Fields Lido is dwarfed by the London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, a legacy of the 2012 Olympics that is home to three pools. The once run-down neighbourhood of Hackney Wick, on the edge of what was the Olympic Park, is now touted as the next London Fields – but that has also meant the demolition of Vittoria Wharf, forcing out a community of poorer residents and artists.London Fields Lido “is not a country club for the affluent,” Burke insists. “It’s important that this facility is able to be accessed by people irrespective of their socioeconomic, ethnic, religious backgrounds.” He says he hopes that the new refurbishment of the changing rooms – which includes the introduction of internal cubicles and internal lockers – will broaden its appeal, as well as satisfying those who have previously been concerned about modesty or security.So far, it’s hard to tell. The newly-refurbished lido reopened in January many of the swimmers are young and white, more typical of newcomers to the neighbourhood than longtime residents. This may not be the classless vision of lido culture that its great political advocates imagined in the 30s when they built the pools in London and across the UK. It may not be the community that the campaigners imagined either, when they fought to revive the lido and what was then a run-down market. But it’s now a fixture and a landmark – even if that’s as a symbol of ision as much as transformation.A version of this article appears in Tales of Two Cities, edited by Claire Armitstead Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dfdcf4b7515bb2e03c8c1033bde7e28dc54ef16/0_0_5616_3744/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9ad70168035a37b6b7ffcfff1eeacf5f 1240w","title":"the generation gap is back but not as we know it","story":"There is an ideological conflict brewing between ‘woke’ millennials and an older generation, a conflict where neither understands the other For a while there, in the first part of the new millennium, the generation gap was pretty much assumed to be dead.People in their 40s shopped in the same clothing stores as people in their 20s, and listened to the same sort of music.If you were on the left, you all cheered for Obama, and everyone from those in university dorms to the corner office had the Shepard Fairey posters of HOPE, and all ages were engaged in common political struggles (No invasion of Iraq! No blood for oil!).You’d go to a Bloc Party concert and there’d be a finance dude there in his 40s wearing the same Urban Outfitters jeans as the kid in their 20s, and at dinner parties people in their 30s were taking MDMA, and everyone from the 19-year-olds to those high 37-year-olds leaving the dinner parties would end up at the same late-night bars.According to an article on the merging of generations in 2006 in New York Magazine: “This, of course, is a seismic shift in intergenerational relationships. It means there is no fundamental generation gap anymore. This is unprecedented in human history. And it’s kind of weird.”For the younger generation, how to rebel? How to mark yourself as different? Did age even mean anything anyway?It’s 2018, and if you were a five-year-old in 2006, being rocked to sleep by your hipster dad singing you Arctic Monkeys, then you’d be 17 now. The same age as the Parkland kids – who many are characterising as a “new generation” (this label has been applied to the Parkland kids by outlets including the New Yorker, the New Republic, Christian Science Monitor and Salon).Those who are a couple of years older are entering workplaces and colleges – and you know what? There is a generation gap – just not in the way that we imagined it.It’s not about style. It’s not about about taste in music (“Turn down that racket!”). It’s about language and battles over inclusivity, ersity and power structures.And it’s a whole lot more complicated and confusing than the generation gaps of yore – where the olds were horrified at the Beatles and their long hair.Boots on the ground – what does the new generational conflict look like? Inside the newsroom at the New York Times there is an ideological conflict brewing between the old guard and the “new woke” employees. An article published last week in Vanity Fair titled “Journalism is not about creating safe spaces’: Inside the woke civil war at the New York Times” illustrates the tensions.In the newsroom, the battle lines are being drawn around older hands who believe in reporting a erse range of views (including those that the left may find offensive), and who think that the reporting of the Trump presidency should be fairly straight down the line.The younger generation were appalled at the 2016 election results and have expressed grievance at the Times hiring for their opinion pages one writer who has expressed scepticism about climate science and a millennial who supports campus free speech.Other grievances within the newsroom that Vanity Fair reports as being split along generational lines include reaction to a reporter being allowed to return to work (in a demoted capacity) after being accused of sexual harassment and the managing editor, Dean Baquet, appearing at the same FT conference as Steve Bannon.According to the Vanity Fair piece “as at many newsrooms and media offices, and in the culture at large, this is a moment of generational conflict not seen since the 1960s”.In Australia this conflict includes debates around who gets to tell what stories. For example – whether a fiction author has the right to depict an experience that is not her own (so a white Australian woman writing the experiences of a queer Indigenous man).This issue came to a head at the 2016 Brisbane writers festival – where the novelist Lionel Shriver gave the keynote address and argued that novelists should be free to to write from the point of view of characters from other cultural backgrounds. In the audience was the writer and engineer Yassmin Abdel-Magied, who found the speech offensive and walked out.She later wrote for Guardian Australia on the experience: “It’s not always OK if a white guy writes the story of a Nigerian woman because the actual Nigerian woman can’t get published or reviewed to begin with.“It’s not always OK if a straight white woman writes the story of a queer Indigenous man, because when was the last time you heard a queer Indigenous man tell his own story?“How is it that said straight white woman will profit from an experience that is not hers, and those with the actual experience never be provided the opportunity?”Or it shows up in a reconsideration of the work of Chris Lilley – once a Gen X icon for Summer Heights High and We Can Be Heroes, but now being chastised and on the nose for depictions of characters such as Jonah from Tonga. The show did not go down too well with critics in the US and UK – with the Huffington Post describing Lilley as “a 39-year-old white guy in a permed wig and brownface. Yes, brownface. In 2014.” Yet when when Summer Heights High first aired in 2007, the brownface went largely unremarked upon.This week it’s The Simpsons that has come under fire for its flip response to anger over the depiction of the long-running Indian character Apu (Lisa says “Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?”)Part of this gap between young and old is the rise and mainstreaming of identity politics and intersectionality, a theory originating in black feminism, that calls out identity-based oppression.This theory, around since the late 1980s and 90s and used to describe interlocking and structural systems of power, was coined in 1989 by the academic Kimberlé Crenshaw. It is used to describe, in Crenshaw’s words, the “multiple avenues through which racial and gender oppression were experienced.”So how a black hotel cleaner might experience workplace discrimination is different from how a white, upper-class lawyer might experience it – because other forces of oppression are also at work other than gender discrimination.Intersectionality was once a notion confined to the campus – its concerns did not reach the editorial conference room in the newspaper, in the programming of a music or writers festival, or the writers room of a TV sitcom.But in recent years it has jumped off the page and into real-life discussions about Me Too and Black Lives Matter, for example.Back in 2006 – when the generation gap was pronounced deceased by New York magazine (and a year before Jonah from Tonga was shown on Australian television to an accepting public) – words associated with this movement such as no-platforming, the use of “a violence” as a verb, and woke as an adjective, microaggression, and cisgender heterosexual either did not exist, or had not entered the mainstream.The woke generation (young millennials aged between 18 and 30) brought the theories of intersectionality and identity into debates about a range of human rights issues: campus free speech, trans rights, the Me Too movement, marriage equality, gun control, reproductive rights, Black Lives matter and, in Australia, the Change the Date movement.This new way of looking at the world has resulted in a golden age of protest, dissent and pushing back against societal norms. Marches in the US – such as the women’s march and the one for gun control – have smashed attendance records, while in Australia, the Invasion Day march surpassed all expectations of crowd size.The landscape has shifted dramatically in the past few years, and older people (on the left and right) have found that they have been tripped up and called out by their more woke colleagues or friends or Twitter followers.(The Wall Street Journal, in a piece this week, somewhat gleefully predicted it would be those who policed “wokeness” who would destroy the left). Left-leaning Gen Xer’s thought that by listening to Rihanna, skateboarding to work and going to Coachella, they could defeat the generation gap. Now they are grappling with the idea that they may be causing offence – sometimes inadvertently – through a tweeted microaggression or an offensive Halloween costume or sombrero worn at a tequila party or a positive comment about Bill Leak’s legacy or personality on Twitter after he died.The response – at least online – is punitive if offence is caused. According to the piece in New Yorker on the new campus politics – it’s “flummoxed many people who had always thought of themselves as devout liberals. Wasn’t free self-expression the whole point of social progressivism?”This is a generation gap – it’s just unlike any other we have seen before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f2334c48fa350fd55b37b7134f7d2d93e041719/371_266_1673_1004/master/1673.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=101319c687549800306aba58af1dd460 1240w","title":"un inspectors not bombs peace syria jeremy corbyn","story":"These are serious times. Following the\u0026nbspmissile attacks on Syria, now is the\u0026nbspmoment for a powerful push for peace. Boris Johnson’s blithe acceptance on Sunday that the conflict will now continue on its current course and that peace negotiations would be an “extra” is an unconscionable abdication of responsibility and morality.Already this devastating conflict has cost more than\u0026nbsp500,000 lives and led to 5 million refugees being\u0026nbspforced to flee Syria, and 6 million internally displaced. We must put negotiations for a political settlement centre stage, and not slip into a new cycle of\u0026nbspmilitary reaction and counter-reaction.Protracted external military intervention in Syria –\u0026nbspfrom funding and arms supplies to bombing and boots\u0026nbspon the ground – has not helped in the slightest. Syria has become the theatre for military action by regional and international powers – the United States, Britain, Russia, France, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates among them.Saturday’s attack on sites thought to be linked to Syria’s chemical weapons capability was both wrong and misconceived. It was either purely symbolic – a demolition of what appear to be empty buildings, already shown to be entirely ineffective as a deterrent – or it was the precursor to wider military action. That would risk a reckless escalation of the war and death toll, and the danger of direct confrontation between the US and Russia. Neither possibility offers an end to the war and suffering, or any prospect of saving lives – rather the opposite. The intensification of military action will simply lead to more deaths and more refugees.There can be no question of turning a blind eye to the\u0026nbspuse of chemical weapons. Their deployment constitutes a crime, and those responsible must be held\u0026nbspto account. The Assad government was supposed to\u0026nbsphave given up its chemical munitions stocks (though not chlorine) under the UN-backed agreement of 2013, and hundreds of tonnes were destroyed under the supervision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Russia and the US.Contrary to what is claimed, UN security council agreement was secured then, and again in 2015 and 2016, for an independent UN chemical weapons inspections regime. That can and must be re-established, as both sides in the security council are now proposing.Inspectors must be given full access to collect evidence, as well as additional powers. Russia must be held to its 2013 commitments, and pressure be exerted on the Assad government to cooperate with investigations into the outrage at Douma.The same applies to the armed opposition groups, some Saudi- or western-backed, which have also been implicated in the use of chemical weapons. Pressure can also be applied on those found responsible through sanctions, embargoes and, if necessary, through the international criminal court.Full accountability will depend on an end to the conflict. But there is plenty that can be done now, without adding fuel to the Syrian fire. There are those who are sceptical of multilateral diplomacy. But it is essential to insist on legality and on a UN sanction for any further military action. We can’t accept that a “new cold war” is unavoidable, as the UN secretary general António Guterres has warned. A shift from the rhetoric of endless confrontation with Russia could also help lower the temperature and make a UN consensus for multilateral action to end Syria’s agony more likely.The military action at the weekend was legally questionable. The government’s own justification, which relies heavily on the strongly contested doctrine\u0026nbspof humanitarian intervention, does not even meet its own tests. Without UN authority it was again a matter of\u0026nbspthe US and British governments arrogating to themselves an authority to act unilaterally\u0026nbspwhich they do\u0026nbspnot possess.The fact that the prime minister ordered the attacks without seeking authorisation from parliament only underlines the weakness of a government that was in reality simply waiting for authorisation from a bellicose and unstable US president. That’s why we are pressing for parliament to have the final say on planned military action in future in a new war powers act.Further military action would be reckless. Even more than was the case in the disastrous interventions in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan, the continuing war in Syria is fraught with the danger of a wider conflict, starting with Russia and dragging in Turkey, Iran, Israel and others.Nor is there any political plan on offer. Libya offers the most recent, and calamitous, example of a military operation launched with no thought to the political aftermath. Meanwhile the UK-backed Saudi bombing campaign in Yemen is a humanitarian disaster.The British government needs to act as a restraining influence in this crisis, not a camp follower. It is welcome that the UN security council will now be discussing both a new weapons inspections regime and a revival of the stalled peace talks. Such discussions need to be conducted with the aim of agreement, not big power point-scoring.We have to remove the scourge of chemical weapons\u0026nbspbut also use our influence to end the still greater scourge of the Syrian war. A diplomatic solution that will allow for the country to be rebuilt, for refugees to be able to return home and for an inclusive political settlement that allows the Syrian people to decide their own future could not be more urgent.All this, and not a fresh bombing campaign, is what\u0026nbspthe British people want from their government. Now is the moment for moral and political leadership, not kneejerk military responses.• Jeremy Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/613f9807da54d9224a63c55a0ca0f5984dff6d94/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=eac6fef734e33cbfc5a3be52ba3ddce6 1720w","title":"pupils special educational needs children mainstream schools","story":"Policies that seek to push these children out of mainstream schools are turning back the clock to a nastier ageHuman progress is slow to happen and sometimes hard to see: in an era as troubled as ours, the world can easily look as though it is regressing at speed. But look back, and you may see how far we have come. I grew up in a world where grim words such as “handicapped” and “retarded” were part of everyday speech, and disabled people were too often shut away. People put money in charity tins to salve their consciences, and then went back to their ignorance. A sure sign of the way society kept some people at arm’s length was the inhuman use of the definite article: people knew about “the deaf”, “the blind” and “the disabled”, but didn’t give them much thought.Many of these attitudes linger. But millions of people now know that even the word “disability” often does little justice to who people actually are, and how much the concept blurs into the supposedly “able” population. In the field of autism, the new paradigm of “neuroersity” underlines a similar point. On a good day, it can feel like a set of old prejudices may at last be being laid to rest. Human beings are complex: as the American writer Steve Silberman puts it in his book NeuroTribes, “Just because a computer is not running Windows doesn’t mean it’s broken. Not all the features of atypical human operating systems are bugs.”And then you look at the English education system – or, more specifically, the arrangements and policies for kids with so-called special educational needs – and wonder what happened. Cuts are deepening, and there is a rising sense of children who do not fit in being pushed out lest they threaten the gods of discipline, rote\u0026nbsplearning and competitive exam performance.At the last count, 4,152 children deemed to have special needs had not been found a school place (up from 776 in 2010), and most of them were forced to stay at home without any formal provision. Even if they are in school, thousands more are increasingly being denied the support they need.The ideal of inclusion is based on the simple principle that schools should reflect the world at large, so that education in the dry stuff of spelling and sums is accompanied by schooling kids in the meaning of ersity. Hearing people’s stories, you rather get the sense that this ideal is slowly being superseded by a mixture of chaos and the gradual return of segregation.As things stand, the government funds the majority of pre-16 state education through the dedicated schools grant, one of whose elements is the so-called high needs block, meant to cover the education of children who either need intensive support in mainstream education, or go to special schools. From 2011 up to now, the high needs block has effectively been frozen – and to make things worse, new government rules now limit councils’ ability to top up special–needs funding from the much bigger budgets intended for mainstream schools as a whole.Amid an across-the-board spending squeeze, dozens of local authorities are running high needs deficits. Across England as a whole, there is reckoned to be a £400m gap between what councils say they require for their high needs provision and what the government is providing. So schools are cutting back on teaching assistants, special needs training and outside help. If you have a child with special needs, or know anyone who does, you will know what all this entails. One-to-one provision at school often makes the difference between a child progressing or withdrawing. Without such support, it can feel like the sky is falling in.At the same time, sweeping reforms to the special needs system – which, among other things, extend the state’s responsibilities to thousands of people up to the age of 25 – have been botched and underfunded. There are real concerns about academies either excluding kids with special needs or pushing parents to choose other schools. In an absurd twist, people are now exiting the public-sector system and successfully pushing councils to fund places at independent special schools.In the London borough of Hackney, where a brilliant group of parents is fighting cuts to special needs provision and organising a legal challenge under the banner of Hackney Special Education Crisis, this latter cost now accounts for around half of a nearly £6m high needs overspend. It also threatens to create a vicious circle: more children leaving mainstream schools as their special needs provision gets cut, rising bills for special school places, even more cuts as a result.Meanwhile, many lives are getting more difficult. I spoke this week to the mother of a 10-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when he was five. After three unsuccessful attempts, he now has a formal education, health and care plan that in theory makes his provision dependable and accountable. But the support at his inner London school has been diluted, and she now worries about him being bullied. Looking ahead to secondary school, she says, “We worry won’t be able to get him the support he needs. We’re going to have to battle.” Another mother told me about her 10-year-old son, recently excluded from school for two days, and promised provision that has yet to materialise. “I have a document, and I go to meetings, but I don’t see any results,” she said.It would be easy to think that this is all about austerity, but it is worse than that. In the Conservatives’ 2010 manifesto, there was a pledge to “end the bias towards the inclusion of children with special needs in mainstream schools”, and push back against “the ideologically driven closure of special schools”. In the context of education policy, these pledges have since taken on a more sinister aspect.We all know what modern English education policy is all about: results, league tables, a fixation with “discipline”. The stupid Tory obsession with grammar schools is of a piece with that. Where, you wonder, does\u0026nbspspecial needs education fit in. The beginnings of an answer, perhaps, lie in a government announcement in 2017 that under the auspices of the free schools programme, there are to be 19 new “special free schools”, providing “high quality provision for children\u0026nbspwith special educational needs and disabilities”, to add to around 30 free schools that have already opened. Some councils’ policies are seemingly starting to reflect similar logic. If this causes anyone disquiet, they should get in touch with a pressure group called Allfie – the Alliance for Inclusive Education. “What we’re fighting against is segregated education,” one of their staff members told me this week. “We’re talking about an ideological drive.”I have a child with special educational needs. He’s 11 – and, with a lot of support, he has been taught alongside his peers in mainstream state schools since he was four. He has benefited immeasurably: quite apart from how much he likes such subjects as music, science and IT, he has started to acquire some of the everyday social skills he finds difficult. But that is only half the point. His presence at his endlessly encouraging, proudly erse school means that his peers understand what human difference means in practice. This is the ideal we are now going to have to fight for – before it gets snuffed out, with tragic consequences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559494bf28e04ae011a5a6e1141b1e0046b0a85a/0_0_4866_2919/master/4866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6cfb508aa348a041c09e46678f3f6c41 1240w","title":"arts industry report asks where are all the working class people","story":"Film, broadcasting, publishing and performing sectors nowhere near representative of UK Working-class people continue to be hugely under-represented in the arts, and the people at the top – mostly well-paid, middle-class white men – are least likely to see it. This conclusion was reached in a new report published today, billed as the first sociological study on social mobility in the cultural industries. The study used data from interviews with 237 people who work in the creative industries to shine light on a problem that the report’s authors said is a longstanding one.The research shows that the people most attached to the idea of the arts being a meritocracy – that the best jobs go to those with the most talent – were white middle-class men who occupied the highest-paid jobs and who were most able to bring about change.One of the paper’s authors, Dave O’Brien, said the sector was “quite socially closed” and “dominated by middle-class white people”. He said the sector was well aware of the problems exposed in the report, which raised questions about why things did not change. “If it knows there are these social problems, why isn’t it doing better? Why is it much more like an elite profession rather than being open and meritocratic? The sector almost congratulates itself as being the good guys.” O’Brien said it was time for people to ask: “Are we the bad guys?”The prevalence of unpaid work in the arts reinforces social inequality, the report says. But there are also more subtle barriers to entry, including “the homogeneous values, attitudes and tastes of people working in cultural occupations”. That includes the fact that cultural workers tend to be socially exclusive and are friends with other creatives and less likely to know someone like a bus driver or a factory worker.The Panic report, a detailed follow-up to research published in 2015, has been released by Create London and Arts Emergency, a charity set up to challenge the “old boys’ network” in the creative industries.The report follows a separate weekend of discussions and screenings at the British Film Institute exploring what it means to be working class in film and TV.The keynote interview was with Maxine Peake, who spoke of the prejudice she had regularly experienced from people in the industry. Many, for example, assumed that people from the north would be working class: “There is only one class in the north, and that’s working class, and if you’re a woman you will be slightly brassy and a bit blowzy if you’re a man you’re either aggressive or you’re angsty and poetic. That is the entire north in a nutshell.”Peake revealed she had been under pressure to sound more posh in the first series of the BBC One barrister drama Silk,. “I went to Rada … and I have still got this accent, so it is a fallacy.”Many speakers talked of the problems in being the gatekeepers, the people at the top. Paul Roseby, chief executive of the National Youth Theatre, said over his decade in the job he had encountered the same Oxbridge-educated people at the BBC in the same jobs. “There does seem to be an iron curtain around opportunity at some of our national institutions we hear the phrase ‘hard to reach’. Well, you are not hard to reach – we are,” he said.Other issues that came up at the BFI’s “working-class heroes” event were reductions in drama teaching in schools and cuts to youth services.Many actors stressed that the profession has always been incredibly hard to get into and that most do not succeed.Lesley Manville, Oscar-nominated this year for her role in The Phantom Thread, said the struggle could be a good thing. “For young people starting now, there is this pressure that it’s all got to come together very quickly. When I started, nobody ever dreamed of making films or going to America it just didn’t happen. You just did the work. There’s so much now about young people being, ‘Are you on social media, are you this are you that, are you in this magazine?’ Get rid of that, it’s nonsense. It’s only about the work.”The Labour party last year held its own inquiry into inequality in the cultural sector, and published a report, Acting Up, which concluded that the word “class” was often missing from the debate about access and ersity.

It was three years ago and I know how to win. I believe in myself but I don’t play.”Jay Rodriguez’s second-half winner meant City securing the league title with five games to spare. “I don’t know if I was the first or second or third but I congratulated them face to face when I had the chance,” Mourinho said. “If I was in their position, I would be very upset if someone said they won because United lost against West Brom. They won because they were the best team and lost only a few points.”“With my experience you don’t titles with inconsistency. You win, of course, with quality, but with consistency in every level, not just the performance level but also the mental level. One of the things we have to improve is consistency.”"},{"url":null,"title":"manchester city premier league champions","story":"Vincent Kompany has challenged his Manchester City team-mates to retain their Premier League title after Manchester United’s shock defeat to the bottom side, West Brom, confirmed Pep Guardiola’s men as champions.With Kompany watching on at his wife’s family home after City’s 3-1 victory over Tottenham on Saturday evening meant United had to avoid defeat against Albion to keep the title race alive, Jay Rodriguez’s goal at Old Trafford ensured the trophy will head to the other side of Manchester for the third time in seven seasons.“You can’t take them for granted – I’ve been lucky to win three but there have been so many I’ve missed as well,” said Kompany. “Today I’m happy and I suppose my team-mates will roll their eyes a little bit but I kind of want to see what the reaction is going to be now. I’ve never retained the title and I want to see if this team has got it to carry on and be even more successful.”He added: “I had that feeling when I woke up this morning but I don’t like to wait and see a team lose so it was a little bit of a different experience today. West Brom are a good team and they don’t deserve to be that low and as they stuck into the game you realised that something could happen. It was a set piece and a lovely goal from Rodriguez so thank you. It was a great feeling.”Guardiola, who said on Saturday that he would be playing golf rather than watching the match, can now add a Premier League winner’s medal to those he claimed in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and La Liga with\u0026nbspBarcelona. City players posted celebratory messages on Twitter with Kevin De Bruyne writing: “Unbelievable season for us. Very happy to call us champions this year.”Confirmation of the title success comes as a fillip at the end of a difficult spell for City, during which they lost in the Manchester derby and suffered a Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool. By completing the job after 33 games, City have emulated the achievement of United, who also secured the crown with five matches to spare in 2001.The Manchester United manager, José Mourinho, said City’s consistency had earned them the title. “Manchester City won the title because they won more points than everybody else, because yesterday they won against Tottenham, because during the season they lost only two matches,” he said.Speaking after the victory over Tottenham which took him to the verge of his 20th trophy as a manager, Guardiola singled out the win over Chelsea in September as the moment his side believed they could triumph.“We played so well in many, many games,” he said. “I think winning in Stamford Bridge gave us the confidence that we could do it. Last season against contenders was not so good – we won few games. Against the last champions that gave us the belief that we were able to go there and play the way we played. But in general we were so stable. We conceded goals but the most important detail is not the goals you concede but the chances we concede. In every game it was few.”Worryingly for City’s rivals, there are no signs that this is the culmination of their journey either. As Guardiola pointed out, the majority of his squad have youth on their side and yet more investment will no doubt follow in the summer. But while their manager admitted the relative inexperience of some of his players may have counted against them in the Champions League, Guardiola believes the standards they have set this season can be an inspiration for the future.“We won with guys who are so young – sometimes playing with guys who that age in the Champions League is complicated. But maybe it was a good lesson for the club for next season,” he said.“Of course the same isn’t going to happen next season but that is the target. We were able to do it once and that means you can do it twice. We have to try next season to be better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fbcdd7a5aa00791e84281fb4c33f529d4f2fdb8/1041_0_2330_1398/master/2330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=983871a7dccdc4f85ba3cdf72f59ce8d 1240w","title":"manchester city premier league champions player ratings","story":"Ederson 910 A flawless debut season in English football – a stark contrast to Claudio Bravo’s disastrous 2016-17 campaign.Claudio Bravo 510 In the shadows.

Had the impressive Jonjo Shelvey finally done enough to convince Gareth Southgate to offer him a place on England’s World Cup flight to Russia? Might Benítez’s achievement in overseeing Newcastle’s collection of 22 points from a possible 36 since New Year’s Day earn him the manager of the year award? And, crucially, will Arsenal’s failure to collect a single point on the domestic road during 2018 finally spell the end for Wenger in north London?They may be looking forward to a Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid but this was the visitors’ fifth straight Premier League away defeat. It provided plenty of clues as to why Wenger’s side remain a disappointing sixth, only four places ahead of Newcastle.In mitigation, Arsenal’s Europa League quarter-final draw at CSKA Moscow on Thursday night was followed by a 5am Friday landing at Luton airport. After a dominant first‑half display here, that rude awakening appeared to catch up with them, with fatigue clearly intruding.Initially though a visiting XI featuring the 18-year-old attacking midfielder Joe Willock making his league debut looked neither overly tired nor missing the absent Mesut Özil – given the day off.Instead Alexandre Lacazette volleyed Arsenal into an early lead at the end of a wonderfully fluent attacking move also featuring Shkodran Mustafi’s 60-yard pass and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s adhesive control and intelligent square ball.It was Aubameyang’s second visit to the north-east, the first having come when he played 2012 Olympic football for Gabon at St James’ Park. Then Aubameyang and friends limbered up with a friendly at nearby Northern League club Heaton Stannington, where he caused quite a stir by arriving in a pair of £2,500 Swarovski crystal-encrusted trainers.Ayoze Pérez – who cost Newcastle a relatively modest £1.5m – is unlikely to ever command the £56m that Arsenal paid for Aubameyang but, almost imperceptibly, the young Spaniard has grown into what initially seemed an unnatural No\u0026nbsp10 role in Benítez’s hallmark formation.So much so that Pérez has now scored three times in the last three games, with the latest pulling Newcastle right back into things on Sunday.In some ways almost a carbon copy of Arsenal’s opener, the equaliser began with a fine 50-yard delivery from Shelvey. Once Dwight Gayle had brought the playmaker’s pass under seamless control and Mustafi – defensively disappointing throughout – negligently stood off, the striker fed DeAndre Yedlin. The right-back’s superb low cross was met by Pérez’s right foot and the ball arrowed beyond Petr Cech.Martin Dubravka’s arrival on loan from Sparta Prague in January has been a key factor behind Newcastle’s renaissance – significantly Lacazette’s goal was the first the Slovakia goalkeeper had conceded at St James’ Park – but bar a momentary brain freeze on Willock’s part he would surely have been beaten again just before half-time.When Mo Diamé slipped, Lacazette was gifted possession and the striker’s pass seemed to have cued the teenager up for a memorable goal but Willock got his feet in an awful tangle and a glorious chance evaporated.The afternoon had turned into an intriguing tactical duel between Arsenal’s slick possession game (featuring the odd encouragingly mature cameo from Willock before his replacement by Danny Welbeck) and the counterattacking strategy that has enabled Benítez to overachieve greatly this season.If the containment capabilities of the vastly improved Jamaal Lascelles and Paul Dummett should not be underestimated, Shelvey’s defence-splitting contributions alongside the quietly influential Diamé have frequently changed games. Against Arsenal Shelvey did much to suggest that Southgate is wrong to continue turning a blind eye to his England candidacy. After all, an unusually subdued Mohamed Elneny would surely not relish facing Shelvey and Diamé every week.As Elneny and company’s legs grew heavier, Islam Slimani, on for Gayle, created Newcastle’s second goal with a header across the area. That delivery allowed Pérez to contribute a clever dummy and neat flick, leaving Matt Ritchie to lift an accomplished chip over Cech, with Nacho Monreal culpable.With Slimani creating havoc, Kenedy subsequently hit the bar and the Blaydon Races was sung ever louder. Beneath a tepid April sun, one team was crumbling. For once, it was not Newcastle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/25/1366883691157/Experience-I-was-swallowe-008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=419dc711fa274fb534549dcfcd7901bd 1240w","title":"i was swallowed by a hippo","story":"The hippo who tried to\u0026nbspkill me wasn\u0027t a\u0026nbspstranger – he and I\u0026nbsphad met before a\u0026nbspnumber of times. I\u0026nbspwas 27 and\u0026nbspowned a\u0026nbspbusiness taking clients down the Zambezi river near Victoria Falls. I\u0027d been working this stretch of river for years, and the grouchy old two-ton bull had carried out the occasional half-hearted attack. I\u0027d learned to avoid him. Hippos are territorial and I knew where he was most likely to be at any given time.That day I\u0027d taken clients out with three apprentice guides – Mike, Ben and Evans – all in kayaks. We were near the end of the tour, the light was softening and we were taking in the tranquillity. The solid whack I\u0026nbspfelt behind me took me by surprise.I turned just in time to see Evans, who had been flung out of his boat, flying through the air. His boat, with his two clients still in it, had been lifted half out of the water on the back of the huge bull hippo.There was a cluster of rocks nearby and I yelled at the nearest apprentice to guide everyone there, to safety. Then I turned my boat and paddled furiously towards Evans.I reached over to grab his outstretched hand but as our fingers were about to touch, I was engulfed in darkness. There was no transition at all, no sense of approaching danger. It was as if I had suddenly gone blind and deaf.I was aware that my legs were surrounded by water, but my top half was almost dry. I seemed to be trapped in something slimy. There was a terrible, sulphurous smell, like rotten eggs, and a tremendous pressure against my chest. My arms were trapped but I managed to free one hand and felt around – my palm passed through the wiry bristles of the hippo\u0027s snout. It was only then that I\u0026nbsprealised I was underwater, trapped up to my waist in his mouth.I wriggled as hard as I could, and in the few seconds for which he opened his jaws, I managed to escape. I swam towards Evans, but the hippo struck again, dragging me back under the surface. I\u0027d never heard of a hippo attacking repeatedly like this, but he\u0026nbspclearly wanted me dead.Hippos\u0027 mouths have huge tusks, slicing incisors and a bunch of smaller chewing teeth. It felt as if the bull was making full use of the whole lot as he mauled me – a doctor later counted almost 40 puncture wounds and bite marks on my body. The bull simply went berserk, throwing me into the air and catching me again, shaking me like a dog with a doll.Then down we went again, right to the bottom, and everything went still. I remember looking up through 10 feet of water at the green and yellow light playing on the surface, and wondering which of us could hold his breath the longest. Blood rose from my body in clouds, and a\u0026nbspsense of resignation overwhelmed me. I\u0027ve no idea how long we stayed under – time passes very slowly when you\u0027re in a hippo\u0027s mouth.The hippo lurched suddenly for the surface, spitting me out as it rose. Mike was still waiting for me in his kayak and managed to paddle me to safety. I was a mess. My\u0026nbspleft arm was crushed to a pulp, blood poured from the wounds in my chest and when he examined my back, Mike discovered a wound so savage that my lung was visible.Luckily, he knew first aid and was able to seal the wounds in my chest with the wrapper from a tray of snacks, which almost certainly stopped my lungs from collapsing and saved my life.By chance, a medical team was nearby, on an emergency drill, and with their help I stayed alive long enough to reach a hospital with a\u0026nbspsurgeon. He warned me he would probably have to take off both my arms and the bottom of my injured leg. In the end, I lost only my left arm – they managed to patch up the rest.Evans\u0027 body was found down river two days later. Attempts were made to find and kill the rogue hippo, but he seemed to have gone into hiding. I\u0027m convinced, though, that I met him one more time. Two years later I\u0026nbspled an expedition down the Zambezi and as we drifted past the stretch where the attack had taken place, a\u0026nbsphuge hippo lurched out of the water next to my canoe. I screamed so loudly that those with me said they\u0027d never heard anything like it. He ed back under and was never seen again. I\u0027d bet my life savings it was the same hippo, determined to have the final word.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

I make certain iniduals VIPs so their messages always sit at the top of my box. Any email from my accountants, for example, goes into a special folder that I prioritise.Another game-changer was to make three folders entitled Today, Week and Month, with the rules based on the date the email was sent. Every day I try to complete the Today box. If I miss it, every Sunday night I work through the Week box, and so on. This stops anxious thoughts such as: “Did I reply to that email, or did I just formulate the reply in my head?”If I am able to respond to an email immediately, I do. If I can’t because I need more information, or want to write on my laptop, I mark it as unread, so it isn’t forgotten.

Her cynical, defiantly un-sunny pop anthem New Rules was an improbable song-of-the-summer last July. Streamed online more than 1bn times since, it has helped establish this 22-year-old Londoner as pop’s beach-storming new conquistador – a winner of two Brit awards in February, and the first female artist to be nominated for five. Lipa has an unusual name and history (she comes from a family of Kosovan academics, parted in the 1990s by war), a room-stilling presence (she stands 6ft-plus in heels), and a talent for hanging together pop-music contradictions, specialising in floor-filling bangers that are somehow both jaded and buoyant, universal and intimate. She’s interesting in a number of ways, all of which I want to explore when I meet her one morning in London, towards the end of her Observer cover shoot. Before anything else, though, we discuss her hands.Specifically Lipa’s palms, which are as tough and as work-worn as a lumberjack’s. It’s as if Lipa has spent the week up to now baking bricks, or fighting in a cage. Laughing about it, sighing, Lipa passes her hands around so that everyone in the studio can have a feel. She blames her personal trainer. “We lift a lot of weights,” she says. “We box.” And the crowds on her recent world tour, Lipa points out, wouldn’t just rouse themselves. “I feel like I’ve spent about a year clapping these hands together and shouting: ‘Come on!’”Lipa is bright, good fun, not easily cowed. She asks to feel my palms and after briefly investigating these pearly idler’s mitts she plants on me a brilliantly sceptical stare, as if to ask: have you ever done a hard day’s work? She’s proud of her work ethic. Last week she was gigging in Australia, where some nights, to the squealy delight of her fans, she not only sang but manned the arena merch stands. “It’s a 24-hour job,” she tells me. “And at this point I want to be able to say yes to everything. Every tour, every show, every shoot, every whatever.”We’re in a warehouse in east London, one of those vast places that’s been whitewashed and stud-walled to make it into a multipurpose space, part studio, part gallery. Now that the glowering and vogueing of the photoshoot is over, Lipa puts on patterned jeans and a loose cream jumper, inside the collar of which she tucks a fistful of her dark shoulder-length hair. She needs a tea and a sit, so together we set off through the warehouse corridors to find somewhere. There’s a small glass-walled room abutting the gallery, and as both are deserted it seems a sensible place to put ourselves. Then midday rolls by, and people wander in off the street to admire the art. Some glance through at Lipa, out of reach and out of earshot beyond a wall of glass.It strikes Lipa as she sips her tea that this all amounts to a pretty good analogy for a pop career. Sitting – exposed, apart and a touch ridiculous – in a giant transparent\u0026nbspbox.“You want to be as honest as possible in the music you make,” she says, thinking not so much of her smash single New Rules, which Lipa did not write herself, as of songs such as Blow Your Mind (Mwah) and IDGAF, Lipa’s blunt, sweary postscripts on unhappy love affairs. She continues: “But then there’s the other side of it, when you do want a bit of a personal life, and you get upset that you’ve opened yourself up so much.” She shrugs inside the cream jumper, which unlooses some of her hair. “I guess it comes with the territory – a figuring-out of the right balance, how to be really content, y’know, in this see-through box I’m now living in.”As I said before, she isn’t easily cowed. Earlier this year Lipa read a comment by one of her fans online and took a moment to respond to it. This was as ephemeral as any social media moment, a come-and-go thing that in the end amounted to a few dozen characters on Twitter. But when I read about the incident (which the tabloids wrote up as a minor scandal) I was intrigued, because it seemed a rare example of a pop star breaking character – to remind the public just how silly and how unreal this whole pop game is. Lipa had just separated from her boyfriend, Paul Klein, of the US rock band LANY and now there was gossipy speculation she was back in touch with an ex, a chef called Isaac Carew. One fan thought of the lyrics to Lipa’s New Rules, in which the dos and don’ts of a break-up were carefully itemised (“One, don’t pick up the phone…”).“Sis,” this fan tweeted at Lipa. “You broke the new rules.”“Sis,” Lipa wrote back a minute later. It was the middle of the night. “Get a grip.”Pop should be taken lightly, Lipa believes. “It has to be fun. You’ve got to enjoy it. You can’t get upset about every little thing.” Music after all is the escape – the real world has plenty of methods for upsetting us\u0026nbspalready.And so we discuss geopolitics, and Lipa’s family history. She comes from a large family of ethnic Albanians, to whom “so much has happened”, she says, “in my grandparents’ lives, and my parents’ lives… When you try to come to it and grasp everything there, it’s a lot.” She does her best to boil down their complicated story.Her mother, Anesa, was born to a Kosovan father and a Bosnian mother. In the 90s, war came first to Bosnia, where Anesa’s mother lived, and then to Kosovo, where by now Anesa was living with her fiance, Dukagjin Lipa. Dukagjin was the son of a well-known historian, Seit Lipa, who at that time was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History. When conflict began to brew in Kosovo, Seit’s career abruptly ended. As Lipa tells it: “Once the Serbians came in, they wanted a lot of the historians to rewrite the history of Kosovo. To change it – that Kosovo was always part of Serbia and never part of Yugoslavia. And my grandfather was one of those people who wouldn’t, so he lost his job, because he didn’t want to write a history that he didn’t believe to be true.”In 1992, Dukagjin and Anesa sought refuge in London, while their parents stayed behind in Kosovo and Bosnia. Seit Lipa died in 1999, the year that the Kosovo war ended. “He had a heart attack. And because the borders were closed, my father couldn’t go back to see him.”Lipa was born in north-west London in 1995. “I’ve seen my parents work every day of my life,” she says. In Kosovo her father was training to be a dentist, her mother to be a lawyer. Sudden flight to London threw all this over, and for a long time Lipa’s parents worked as waiters in cafes and bars. In the evenings, her father took business courses. Her mother retrained in travel and tourism. “While I was going to school they were going to\u0026nbspschool.”Flight and sanctuary form the backbone of her family story, and I ask Lipa what she has made of recent political flailings – specifically President Trump’s crowing about his border wall, and before that the extremist Brexiters with their scare-stories about refugees. Lipa says that coming from a background such as hers, “you understand something on a personal level. That no refugee leaves their country without having to.” As for Brexit itself, “I see how important it is for Kosovo, for Kosovans, to be a part of the EU, what it means for them to be a part of something like that. So it’s heartbreaking.” On Trump she takes the long view – very much the historian’s granddaughter. “Later down the line I think we’ll be able to see very clearly, when we put someone like Trump in power, what went wrong. And the hope is we’ll learn from it.”We talk about that amazing name – her grandmother’s suggestion, she says, as dua is the Albanian word for love. “Now I’m proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I’m from Kosovo.” And this in turn made a lot of people adopt a particular expression – intrigued, sad. It was well-meant sympathy, but brutal war isn’t the first thing any kid wants other people to think about when they’re saying hello.Lipa sometimes uploads old family photos to her Instagram, and not a few of them show her parents when they first arrived in London. Yikes! There’s a wedding photo that shows Anesa wearing a headdress of flowers and Dukagjin, who in Kosovo had played in a guitar band, with long rock-star hair. This pair absolutely smouldered. Lipa recalls: “Boys at school would say: ‘Your mum’s really hot.’ And the girls would say: ‘Your dad’s so fit.’ Now I find it funny, but as a kid you didn’t want to be different. It made me blush.”From the available evidence on social media, her parents continue to smoulder. They are great senders of heart emojis, patently still besotted with each other. To be the child of a Really Good Couple, I start to say to Lipa… That can have its own difficulties. Especially if it puts a fixed idea in your head of what love should look\u0026nbsplike.Lipa was 11 when her parents sat her down at the kitchen table with big news. Dukagjin had graduated from his studies and been offered a job in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Lipa was at the end of primary school. “My best friends were all going to different schools. And I told them, ‘Um, I’m going to Kosovo.’”How did you feel?“I was excited. We always spoke Albanian at home. I had my cousins in Kosovo that I’d never met.”And when you got there?“It was absolutely mortifying. Going into a classroom… I remember my first science lesson. They were so far ahead, in terms of mathematics and science. I got such bad grades, especially in the first six months. I could speak the language, but I couldn’t read or write in it.”There was a lot she loved about Pristina. Living there helped Lipa understand she wasn’t just a Londoner, as she’d always thought – that instead she “came from two places”. In musical terms, it was in Pristina that she first got into American hip-hop. Snoop Dogg and Method Man toured through, and these were Lipa’s first gigs. The experience planted in her a love for rap that sat alongside her established obsession with bright, brash pop: Pink, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry. Lipa knew she could sing. Sometimes, in private, she tried mashing together the two influences, putting a deep, drawled, sung-rap spin on her bedroom renditions of Christina Aguilera. She hoped for some formal training and when Lipa was about 14 she sat down with her parents for another kitchen-table conference.Me, says Lipa. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do this on a global scale, living in Kosovo.”You weren’t telling yourself that at 14…OK. But you weren’t telling your parents that at 14…Lipa smiles: yes and no. She came up with “a trick”, she says, selling her parents on the idea that her main goal was to go to a good, British university. “I said: ‘To do that I’ll need to do my GCSEs and A-levels in English.’” It worked, and they agreed. Back in London, Lipa was looked after by friends of her parents. She did enrol at Sylvia Young on weekends, and began recording demos that she uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud.As well as trying to be noticed as a musician, Lipa started a fashion blog. Sweetly titled – “Dua Daily” – this started as a sixth-former’s hobby and was maintained pretty thoroughly for two or three years at the end of her teens. Parts still exist online (Lipa’s voice squeaks when I mention it: “Is it online somewhere? That’s so funny”) and as a document it’s intriguing, charting a young woman’s evolution from wide-eyed kid to a professional London scenester, musing on “how important networking is”. We see her try some modelling, try some acting (at one point in an X Factor ad). For the most part she was forthcoming during this period. Networking, and networking some more, always pushing on anybody in music the links to her demos.Eventually Ben Mawson, Lana Del Rey’s manager, had a listen. He signed Lipa, and started arranging long, immersive studio sessions with different collaborators. (The blog: “I am now currently on a gap year and plan to focus full time on my extra curricular activities. And by that I mean music!”) Client and manager were waiting to hear something that excited them. And the best stuff, tonally, seemed to happen when Lipa’s two preferred genres – moody rap and catchy bubblegum – came crunching together. New Rules was actually written for and rejected by a number of other artists, including the girl band Little Mix. When Lipa tried the track she infused it with something new, a battle-weary languor that made it a timely anthem of millennial ennui. One and a half billion clicks later New Rules remains her calling card, her name-maker. At the Brits in February her performance of the song was the evening’s highlight.She had been nominated in five categories on the night. New Rules was up for best single, and her million-selling debut album, Dua Lipa, was up for best album. In the end she won twice, as best female solo artist and British breakthrough act, which meant two trips to stage\u0026nbspand two very different\u0026nbspspeeches.The first was political. “Here’s to more women on these stages,” Lipa said, “more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world.” Thinking back on this, Lipa tells me it hadn’t gone unnoticed by her that she was the only woman nominated in a number of those other, nominally multi-gender categories… “I felt it was really important to touch on the fact that I’ve always been inspired by women and they were the reason I was stood on that\u0026nbspstage.”Her second speech of the night was softer, wispier – a “chase your dreamsmagic is real” bromide that I now find hard to square with the punchy realist I’ve been taking to all morning. Lipa, not so long ago, was able to step out of the pop bubble and tell a fan: get a grip. Can she really believe in all that dream-chasey, magic-can-happen stuff?Lipa listens to this and says sure. But what she learned from her family’s experience was that you keep going, you keep working, you try to better your chances of better luck. “A big part of who I am,” she says, “has been watching my parents learn to adapt in different places, in different circumstances… And my dad would always tell me: ‘You have to work really, really hard, just to have a tiny bit of luck.’ So to answer your question, I do believe in the romantic side of it. And I believe in the hard graft, too.”She opens her hands: the lumberjack palms.“For me, growing up, doing music, watching pop stars on TV – that felt as crazy as cartoons. Totally unbelievable. Not real. What I’ve learned from my parents is this: everything comes from hard work. And then, maybe, things align.”Dua Lipa is on tour now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/240cee57b371910c688bcb766775bd82b64e7f95/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ef329078575e6ede00e24c78227de7c7 1240w","title":"labour sets its sights on trafford the only tory borough in greater manchester","story":"Andy Burnham’s mayoral success leads party to believe it can retake Trafford after 14 yearsIt is a source of great irritation to many in the Labour party that the political map of Greater Manchester is a sea of red polluted by one pesky blue patch in the south.Trafford – the wealthiest of the 10 boroughs, home to more footballers and Coronation Street stars than all the other nine put together – has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2004 and Jeremy Corbyn is determined to win it back.Last month he chose a leisure centre in Stretford Sports village, across the road from Old Trafford cricket ground, to kick off Labour’s local election campaign. And last year it was in EventCity, a soulless conference hall by the Trafford Centre shopping centre, that he launched the party’s general election campaign, flanked by Labour’s newly elected Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.It was Burnham’s soaraway success in the inaugural mayoral elections that gave Labour hope that it could wrench Trafford back from the Tories. As the only candidate with any name recognition on the ballot, everyone knew he’d win overall – just not in Trafford, where the council leader, Sean Anstee, was standing.Anstee’s bloodless face at the count told a different story. “Oh my god, Andy’s won Hale Central,” shrieked one Labour activist, referring to one of Trafford’s millionaire enclaves, which boasts a high street with four cosmetic surgery clinics and some of the best grammar schools in the country.Kate Green is the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston, which could be described as the “other” Trafford. It includes the poorer bit in the north, which begins in the terraces around Manchester United’s football ground, and takes in Flixton and Urmston, where residents are always complaining about traffic jams caused by the nearby Trafford Centre and the M60 ring road. Life expectancy in some streets is a decade less than in the leafy south of the borough.Green senses Tory blood. “I’m absolutely confident that the Tories are on the back foot in this borough,” she says. “I’ve been knocking on doors week in, week out, ever since the general election last year and they are definitely on the run.” In her constituency, which has been Labour since its inception, sure. But in the posh bits?Absolutely, she says: “There are some very wealthy parts of Trafford but let’s not forget Andy Burnham’s spectacular result in the mayoral election last year. He won many of those very wealthy wards hands down, ahead of the local candidate, Sean Anstee. So I think we can be confident that the Labour vote is broad as well as deep.”Andrew Western, leader of the Labour group on Trafford council, is less bullish. “Yes, Andy Burnham won Hale Central, but that was a freak,” he says. He can’t predict the result: “Normally I’d say to you with some confidence, ‘this is what’s going to happen’. But the world’s gone mad. I don’t know what constitutes normal any more.”The Labour party is concentrating its efforts on winning three key wards from the Tories, which would be enough to slide the council into no overall control. For the first time in history it thinks it’s got a decent shot at Davyhulme East, home to Trafford General, the hospital where Aneurin Bevan launched the NHS in 1948.Local candidate Jayne Dillon is capitalising on changes at the hospital in her campaign. A former midwife who gave up work to look after her three children, two of whom have autism, she sympathises with residents unhappy that there is no longer a full A\u0026ampE clinic. “My mum had to be blue-lighted in an ambulance across to Salford,” she tells voters. That’s just a five-mile journey, but factor in the shopping traffic and the perennially clogged motorway and it can take an hour.Dillon has tapped into other local bugbears, such as opaque plans to turn a much-loved local leisure centre into houses and a base for a local basketball team without proper community consultation, and discontent over plans to build on the green belt in Flixton. Labour also thinks it is in with a chance in upmarket Altrincham. This former market town is home to many lawyers and accountants who commute in on the tram or train to Manchester. Labour has only managed to hold it for a single term in the 1990s.But the Conservatives are in trouble locally. Matthew Sephton, one of the three Tory councillors, was jailed this year for possession of child abuse images. And the well-regarded deputy council leader, Alex Williams, whose wife Lady Williams of Trafford ran the borough council between 2004 and 2009 (they fell in love in the council chamber), is retiring.Step forward one of Labour’s more unusual candidates: Frenchman Stephane Savary, who stood for France’s social democratic Socialist party when he was just 20. A mortgage broker who is in the middle of converting to Judaism, he has been busy recently retweeting the antisemitic abuse he receives on Twitter.He believes if Labour can win in well-heeled Trafford it can win a majority nationally: “It will show that we are winning the middle ground. If we win Trafford we can make an example of what a Labour government would be like.”The Tories, meanwhile, are hammering the themes of grammar schools and low parking fees and slagging off Corbyn. The Greens are also in contention in Altrincham, to Labour’s chagrin.Savary keeps things local on the doorstep. A promise to sort out parking madness extracts a promise from one 77-year-Tory voter to switch to Labour. “But only in the local elections. I don’t like Jeremy Corbyn,” says the retired accountant.But if Savary’s canvas returns are accurate, he is in contention in Altrincham: last Thursday he had spoken to 2,150 residents and extracted promises to vote Labour from 1,096."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da4cac23695b7fb6fa524d1721bd7aa4159e6964/96_0_2809_1686/master/2809.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=778a2798dbf110d679d63552ad4f7701 1720w","title":"nasa to launch tess on hunt for 20000 new worlds","story":"Telescope hitching ride on a SpaceX rocket designed to spot alien worlds If the vagaries of weather and rocket science do not intervene, the most ambitious search for alien worlds around the brightest stars in the sky will begin on Monday with the launch of Nasa’s newest planet-hunting spacecraft.After final preparations at the weekend, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or Tess, is on course for take off as early as 6.32pm local time (11.32pm UK) from Cape Canaveral in Florida, the first opportunity mission controllers have to launch in a window that remains open until June.The lofting of hardware high into space often calls for a holding of breath, but for those who have ploughed time and money into the $200m (£140m) Tess space telescope there is an extra frisson. Theirs is the first Nasa mission to hitch a ride on a Falcon 9, a rocket made by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company, and which was certified for such missions only in February.Barring any mishaps, such as a “rapid unscheduled disassembly” – a glorious euphemism Musk used to describe the explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket stage in 2015 – Tess will be flung into a highly elliptical orbit around Earth that has never been attempted before. The space telescope will swing as far out as the moon as it scours the heavens for planets, then swoop back towards Earth to beam home its data. Each orbit will take nearly 14 days.“Right now, everything is go for a launch on Monday,” said Stephen Rinehart, the Tess project scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. “Putting stuff up in space is not without risk, but at this point there is nothing more we can do. We think we’ve got a spacecraft that is ready to kick ass once it’s up in orbit.”Tess comes hot on the heels of Nasa’s Kepler space telescope which transformed scientists’ understanding of planets beyond the solar system. When Kepler launched in 2009, astronomers knew that alien worlds circled faraway stars, but had little idea of their number and sizes. As of last month, Kepler had found more than 2,300 “exoplanets” a similar number await confirmation.Based on Kepler’s observations, astronomers now believe that the Milky Way is home to at least two billion potentially habitable planets where conditions are neither too hot nor too cold for life-sustaining water to flow. But for all Kepler’s success, it observed only a fraction of the sky and most of the stars it studied are extremely faint, making it hard for astronomers to look more closely at the planets that swing around them. This is where Tess comes in. The space telescope will spend two years observing 200,000 of the brightest stars in the sky. Most will be no more than 300 light years away. Like its predecessor, Tess is designed to spot alien worlds by detecting the subtlest of shadows they cast as they move across the face of their parent stars.Bill Chaplin, the professor of astrophysics at Birmingham University, will use Tess data to look at how stars contract and expand as seismic waves surge through them. His calculations will help astronomers confirm the masses and ages of the new planets they find. “When you look up at the night sky, we’ll know about the planets that are around the stars you can see with the naked eye,” he said.Mission scientists hope to spot 500 Earth-sized planets and perhaps 20,000 new worlds in total. Astronomers will then draw on ground-based telescopes, and soon-to-launch space-based observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope scheduled for 2020, to look more closely at the planets. With those follow-up measurements in hand, scientists can work out the planets’ masses and densities, and perhaps even what gases fill their atmospheres. It is no simple task, but if water, methane and other key molecules are found, scientists can start to talk about whether life could, or did, gain a foothold on the distant worlds.“There are some people on the mission who are very, very, very keen to find Earth-sized planets in the habitable zones of their host stars and that would be absolutely fabulous,” said Rinehart. “But the data on all these planets is interesting, because they help us form a picture of how planetary systems form and evolve. It’s going to be a game-changer in our ability to study planets.”In 2028, the European Space Agency plans to launch Ariel, the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey, to study the atmospheres of 1,000 exoplanets ranging in size from Jupiter to not much larger than Earth. “Tess will provide hundreds of exoplanets, especially super-Earths, which will be optimal targets for atmospheric characterisation with Ariel,” said Giovanna Tinetti, principal investigator on the mission at UCL.But first Tess must reach its intended orbit. Should the Falcon 9 release the space telescope on the correct trajectory, mission scientists will spend 60 days running tests on its systems and sensors, calibrating the cameras and ironing out any bugs. The first batches of data are expected to land in June, but researchers will work on the information for months before making results public.“My real hope is that we start finding things that we didn’t expect,” said Rinehart. “If we knew what all the answers were before we launched the mission, why the hell would we fly the mission?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c11a438df90db330832f2c35c0617a7e9fd71a71/0_549_8348_5009/master/8348.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=310650b99a3816ddf7f1ff9d7aa4357f 1240w","title":"janet mock id never seen a young trans woman who was thriving in the world i was looking for that","story":"The 35-year-old activist and bestselling author tells her remarkable story – and explains why she’s working on a new drama about trans women of colour that will be nothing like TransparentJanet Mock is talking so fast I can’t keep up. One moment we are in Hawaii and she is living, desperately uncomfortably, as a little boy called Charles. The next she is 10 years old and has created the alter ego Keisha to enable her to talk to boys on the phone. Then she is living happily as a transgender girl, a star pupil and captain of the school volleyball team.

And I’m excited because this is a new space in my career.”Her sentences are regularly punctuated with the word “space”, perhaps not surprisingly for somebody who has had to fight so hard to claim hers.Mock is fastidiously polite. At times, she sounds like an old-fashioned southern belle dreamed up by Tennessee Williams. In fact, she grew up impoverished in Honolulu. Her father, Charlie, is African-American and was a drug addict (she had no idea and was devastated to discover when she was young that neighbours knew him as “Charlie the crackhead”). Her mother, Elizabeth, is Hawaiian. The family was broken and dysfunctional, but loving in its own chaotic way. As a seven-year-old, Mock went to live with her father in Oakwood, California. Her father called young Charles a sissy. Mock says she was called all sorts when she was growing up – freak, faggot, tranny, the N-word.She did not see her mother for five years until, at the age of 12, she returned to Honolulu, where she flourished. Her mother never discouraged her from becoming Janet (a name she chose after a friend told her she looked like Janet Jackson). “There were bigger issues in our family. My mom didn’t have the luxury of time and resources to micromanage any of her children’s lives.” It was a blessing, she says – wealthier parents might have paid for therapy to “right” her.Mock was helped by the fact that gender is relatively fluid in Hawaii. The word “māhū” denotes a third gender. It is a pejorative for gay men and drag queens, but it can also have a sense of the sacred attached to it.“My mom, growing up in Hawaii, saw trans people existing every day. She didn’t know they were trans. She was just like: ‘Oh, that’s such-and-such who lives on the street.’ It was the norm to have people who were not male or female people who may be in the middle somewhere.”Mock, now 35, splits her time between Los Angeles and New York. We meet for lunch at a stately hotel in West Hollywood. Mock is gorgeous – tall, curvy, with brown, almond-shaped eyes, a perfect smile and cheek-bones so high you could hoist a flag on them. Despite her sing-song voice, she is fierce and forensic in her arguments.She orders a super-strong cold brew (coffee brewed for hours in cold water) and a steak dish and we return to her past. At 15, she began hormone treatment without telling her mother. Soon after, she started selling sex and stripping to pay for her $7,000 (£5,700) surgery. The only thing she regrets, she says, is doing a\u0026nbspporn shoot to earn the final $1,500. “The sex work was private, but this was on record for the rest of my life.” In her first memoir, Redefining Realness, she wrote that she was “immortalising the one part of my\u0026nbspbody that brought me so much\u0026nbspanguish”.I ask when she started thinking of herself as Janet and she says it is a false premise she always thought of herself as a girl who was cursed by biology. She knew she wanted sex-reassignment surgery, but that was not going to determine her gender. “I believed I was, and knew myself as, a young woman, even when I had a penis. It wasn’t as if I needed the surgery to confirm that for me.”Was there any point at which she felt she could be complete without surgery? “I did not, but that’s just my experience. I know a lot of people who do, and that’s where the burden of representation comes in. I’m sitting here telling my specific story, but though I wasn’t comfortable with that, there are thousands of people who are, or thousands who don’t have access to the funds to have surgery.”Mock often talks about the burden of representation. She might be regarded as a spokeswoman for trans women, but she does not pretend her experience is representative. For one thing, she was fortunate enough to be able to choose whether to disclose she was trans. Many trans women do not have that privilege – their appearance gives them away.She has said that without her smile and her MA in journalism, nobody would have listened to her. “The ‘pretty privilege’ can give you access to spaces, just like your able body gives you access. But it makes impossible beauty standards for many other trans girls who are struggling with that right now.”She argues that trans women obsess too much about being able to “pass”, but she knows it is easy for her to say. She, too, obsessed about that in the past – ironically, one of the things she found validating was one of the things she most despised: men objectifying her.She drains her cool brew, and our main course arrives – steak, brown rice, vegetables. “Oh, my God! This looks really good.” She examines one of the vegetables curiously, and calls over Wayne, the waiter.“Wayne, is this like a sweet potato?”She has a way of engaging with people and dismissing them with self-assured charm.Mock says so much has changed in the trans world since she was young. She hopes few people today need to go to the lengths she did to fund surgery. Would she swap her story for a more sober version? “No. I would have my story,” she says instantly. Is there any time she would have swapped it ? “When I was living it yeah. Che-che-che-che!” She laughs loudly and uninhibitedly, as if clearing her throat. “I wanted a genie to pop up and grant me three wishes – to get all this over with, to have a financial safety net and to be comfortable. But I wouldn’t take anything from my experience because it built my resolve my core.\u0026nbspI fought for every single thing I\u0026nbsphave now.”Actually, Mock says, there was a great support network among sex workers. “The girls felt safe there. We took care of each other. You showed up, you knew who was there and how long she’s gone. We weren’t doing it in isolation. Now sex work had gone online so you’re by yourself all the time.”When she left Hawaii for New York, three years after surgery, Mock chose not to reveal that she was trans. She embarked on a new life experience, described in her second memoir Surpassing Certainty. “If I had disclosed, it would have made people judge me, made them not want to be with me, made me an object, a freak show. I would have been the trans girl in the room. To reveal to a class of strangers the heaviness of my past was just too much. It’s inconvenient. The inconvenient truth! And I didn’t want to be inconvenienced. It would get in the way. I just wanted to go to school to get a job, and move on.”She felt both freed and imprisoned. “The secrecy was hard to cope with,” she says. Mock also became aware of her blackness in a way she had never been before. In Hawaii, she was primarily identified as trans and “everybody was at least brown or tinted in some way”. At New York University, she was one of a handful of black students. “So, in Zora Neale Hurston’s words, I was thrust against a white backdrop.” She pauses. “I love Zora. She is THE\u0026nbspQueen!”Her progress in the publishing world was seamless. Before long, she was an editor and writer at People magazine. But she became bored. She realised she had a better story to tell than the celebrities she was interviewing. And she wanted to own that story. In 2009, she met photographer Aaron Tredwell, who was to become her second husband. “I started telling the people in my life and I was like: ‘Oh, this story is interesting because I’ve never seen it before. This is pre-Orange Is the New Black, pre-Caitlyn Jenner.’ And I was like: ‘I think I should tell my story.’ I’d never seen a young trans woman who was living and thriving in the world, and I was looking for that.”Throughout the Obama years, she says, transgender rights improved considerably in the US, but now Donald Trump is determined to reverse that progress. Last July, he attempted to introduce a blanket ban on transgender people joining the military.“There is a lot of rowing back on protections that the Obama administration put through: the guidelines for trans children in schools trans-specific affordable healthcare the military ban.” She says it is part of a wider general clampdown on rights for minorities.Trans women have been questioned from more than one side of the political spectrum. What does Mock make of the continuing opposition from some feminists?“I think it is rooted in the same thing they say they’re fighting against – biological essentialism. So, it’s saying that if you don’t have these specific biological experiences as a woman you cannot be a woman, you cannot be in our struggle. I would argue that for women to say the only identifying factor of a woman is a pussy is misogynistic. If we’re saying that to be a feminist is to eliminate barriers and alleviate marginalisation based on gender, then how could you not want to include the persecuted trans women\u0026nbspor non-binary folk so you have more comrades to fight against gendered oppression?”She looks me in the face. “My grandmother gets who I am, so when you ask me about people who don’t understand, or people who are on their bully pulpits saying you shouldn’t accept people, I’m like: “What’s happened to you that, of all the things you can talk about, of all the injustices in the world, the one thing you want to concentrate on is trans people living their truth? How is that harming you and your identity? How I identify has nothing to do with you, and how you identify has nothing to do with me. Right? So live your life and let me live mine.”She chews on her steak, decisively. I hope that is not directed at me, I say, cowering. She stops in her tracks and bursts out laughing. “Che-che-che-che. Nonononoo.”Mock has spent much of the past year as part of the writingproducing team on Pose, the new trans drama devised by Glee creator Ryan Murphy. She is also directing one episode. I ask her what she thinks of Transparent, the US comedy-drama about a middle-aged father who becomes a trans woman.“I don’t watch it, so I don’t know,” she says.But it is one of the few dramas featuring trans characters, I insist.“It was never really for me. Just because there’s a trans character doesn’t mean it’s a show I would watch.”But I persist. Surely, if you are making a drama about trans people, you would want to watch what has gone before. “You’re really stuck on\u0026nbspthis Transparent thing, which is interesting to me,” Mock says, smiling. But, now, it is a hollow smile.She quietly but firmly puts me in my place. “It’s about somebody way older than me, who was a professor. Transparent is about a white, middle-class, liberal family, so there\u0026nbspare no intersections that interest me.”What makes her so excited about Pose is that it is about the very people she knows and cares about. “Our show is centring on trans women of colour in a way they’ve not been centred on ever. What’s so radical to me is that, unlike Transparent, where there is one main character who is trans and played by a man, we have five main characters who are trans played by trans women. That five black and brown trans women will be the centre of a show on a network drama in primetime is huge. And they’re going to be on billboards. It’s\u0026nbspamazing this is going to exist in the world.”I tell Mock I have one final question, from a trans friend of my elder daughter. She asked: “How can a nice trans girl like me find the perfect husband like Aaron,” I say.Mock roars with delight. “That is so sweet! What is her name?” Charlie, I say.“To be in a relationship is an incredibly vulnerable space to be in, so you have to be willing to be open, to not be afraid of that intense gaze on you. Aaron was intense he really wanted to know me. And I chose to show up as myself, and I chose to be vulnerable and tell him my story, and that has been the foundation of our relationship. We’re going to challenge one another by telling the truth to one another, then be strong enough to stick around when that truth is not exactly what we thought we were going to hear. I hope that helps Charlie.”I’m sure it will, I tell her, and\u0026nbspexplain that Charlie is also an\u0026nbspactivist.“What is her second name?” Charlie Craggs, I say.“Oh, I know that name,” she whoops. “I’m not kidding. I follow her on Twitter.” Within seconds, she is searching her Twitter account. “Craggs? Cr … Cra … See, I told you,” she shouts, triumphantly.Two cold brews down, and having just discovered Charlie, she is talking faster than ever. “I love that! It’s a small world. Shows how deeply connected we are! Che-che-che-che.”This is who she has written her books for, she says – the next generation. Mock says she has done her bit: she can now go off and write screenplays and be a boring old binary trans woman. It is up to people like Charlie to take up the cudgels. “There are trans girls who are still navigating these spaces and wanting to learn and grow and they need something fun to look at when they see themselves. They don’t just need to know the tragedy and trauma of being trans. They also need to know how to better be, how to better live, how to better dream.”Surpassing Certainty, Mock’s memoir will be published worldwide on 1 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=753d6942c7d2626af14b48ca118c2500 1240w","title":"value of london flats slashed by grenfell style cladding","story":"Home in New Capital Quay, Greenwich, worth £50,000 rather than £475,000, owner toldA homeowner in a housing complex in London with Grenfell-type cladding has been told the value of her £475,000 home has collapsed and is now just £50,000.Galliard Homes, the developer of the 11-block complex in New Capital Quay in south-east London, is facing a £30m-£40m bill to replace the cladding and is currently locked in a legal dispute over who should pay.The dispute, which could take years to resolve, has left Cecile Langevin, 32, and potentially thousands of others up and down the country, with an unsellable flat.“It is like someone has taken away our life choices, our freedom,” she said. “And nobody is doing anything about it,” she added, in tears.She has a two-year-old son and was due to give birth to her second child on Saturday. She had put their flat on the market in the hope of moving out of London to a bigger home.She got a Rics-approved surveyor to value her flat recently and was shocked when he came back with a £50,000 price tag. But now she realises the whole complex is blighted.“All ongoing sales in the development have fallen through. Banks are not lending to potential buyers and provide valuations of zero for flats in our development,” she said.Langevin is one of around 2,000 residents in NCQ in Greenwich, believed to be the largest private development found to have flammable cladding after the West London disaster that cost 71 lives.“I don’t sleep at night. I wake up most nights for a few hours and I write emails to people I think that can help,” said Langevin.“I can’t move very fast. What would happen if my husband was away one night? We are on the seventh floor. What if if I was there with my son and new baby and all the people were at the stairs and I couldn’t get out?” she asked.While cladding remains on such buildings the fire brigade requires 247 fire patrol in case evacuation is needed, but in three cases so far in private blocks, including one in Croydon and one in Salford, this has meant leaseholders will face bills potentially of tens of thousands of pounds.“It is quite shocking that the residents are living in potential death traps while everybody else tries to deny liability for the cost of making them safe. There is the potential for the residents to bring group legal proceedings to recover the cost of fixing the buildings and for the considerable distress they must be suffering,” said Chris Haan, a lawyer at the London law firm Leigh Day.He has been approached by a number of home owners in NCQ and said they may have a case against the developers for breach of contract when they sold homes “fit for habitation when completed”.Langevin funded the flat in 2014 through some savings, a mortgage with a high-street bank and a £95,000 government loan under the Help to Buy scheme designed to help people without enough savings to get on the property ladder.Langevin believes that many other homes in the NCQ development were purchased on the Help to Buy scheme, which was heavily promoted by Galliard at the development’s launch.She has had no answer from Target HCA, which is administering the scheme, other than to say it is a “novel” request. “They are being evasive, because they know if they have to do this for me they have to do it for everyone who asks,” she said.Regardless of how much of the government loan she has to repay, Langevin is still subject to huge negative equity because the value of the flat has plummeted.She said she is now at her wits’ end and suffering from stress over her situation. She said she can’t move out and rent to others because she would feel terrible “if they were caught in a fire”. It is also not permissible under her Help to Buy contract.She contacted the housing minister, Dominic Raab, but he did not reply. “I don’t think he cares about ordinary people,” she said. It is likely that thousands of private home-owners are in Langevin’s situation, with government data showing 301 blocks over 18 metres tall have Grenfell-type cladding, of which 130 are in the private sector and 13 are hospitals or schools. Of the public buildings, only seven have had their cladding replaced so far.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We have made clear that we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential cladding replacement to leaseholders.“We are keeping the situation under review and ministers are meeting industry representatives shortly to discuss this.”Campaigners said the cladding was causing financial ruin for home owners.“The blight caused by Grenfell is national and the government doesn’t seem to be too bothered about that. So far what we have heard from Greenwich and Croydon is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Martin Boyd, a trustee at the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a service that advises leaseholders on their rights over cladding and other issues.Galliard Homes declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df87dc82a726dc76e37a38ed655b6d2776782aa/0_0_3863_2319/master/3863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b9e31cab67b636131d7f69e430252ebb 1240w","title":"daniel ricciardo claims chinese grand prix as verstappen clips vettel","story":"No driver, it seems, is going to have an easy ride in Formula One this season but if the rollercoaster of the Chinese Grand Prix is repeated the sport will be all the better for it.For Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, who won the race, it was the climax of an emotional and challenging two weeks. From frustration, unhappiness and even questioning his future in F1 after retirement at the last round in Bahrain, the Australian emerged from a meeting of two halves triumphant and euphoric, having made his mark in the race of the season with emphatic style.Ricciardo’s overtaking was superlative but behind him there was a different picture, with Mercedes’s Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel left licking their wounds after finishing in fourth and eighth respectively.Hamilton was relieved that rather than dropping points to the German he has narrowed the gap in the title battle from 17 to nine points but the first half of the race proved that his team have been put on the back foot by Ferrari, who have the quicker car. Valtteri Bottas was second for Mercedes but they have much work to do.Kimi Räikkönen finished in third for Ferrari but they too face questions after their strategy was found wanting. Vettel had led from pole until the pit stops and Mercedes brought Bottas in first while Vettel stayed out. The Finn put in some very quick sectors going for the undercut and a slow stop for the Scuderia cost Vettel and he emerged in second. The win looked to be in Mercedes’s hands, with Hamilton doing his best at damage limitation having started from fourth.But the real drama was yet to come. The two Toro Rossos clashed at turn 14, leaving debris in their wake, and Red Bull’s reaction to the subsequent safety car was swift and tactically astute. They sent both drivers into the pits and they emerged on new, soft rubber with the pace to hunt down the leaders.Max Verstappen was the leader of the two but he was overambitious making a move on Hamilton and went off, losing his place to Ricciardo. The Australian, who had been in sixth, needed no further encouragement. Hamilton fell with a superb piece of late braking into the hairpin, Vettel on the back straight and then Bottas with a e up the inside of turn four that took the breath away. Ricciardo was magnificent and, out of contract at the end of this year, presented a potent reminder of his talent to Ferrari and Mercedes, who both potentially have seats open next season.Yet it had been so close to another resolution-sapping weekend for the Australian. On Saturday, after an engine problem in practice, he only just made qualifying. The team did superbly to fix it and he made the most of it.“This sport’s crazy,” he said. “A week ago I was with my head down. Frustrated at the sport, frustrated at all the variables. Sometimes I question why I chose this sport because there’s so many things out of your control and it does get you down a lot – but then when you have a day like this it’s worth fifty of those bad ones.”Hamilton was forthright that he had been unable to match Ferrari. “I had no pace and was just trying to hold on,” he said. “Yesterday and today was a disaster on my side.”But the team, too, must consider their part. They opted not to send the British driver to the pits for fresh rubber when Red Bull did and it proved costly. The team principal, Toto Wolff, said they had thought track position was more important. “Looking back, it would have been the right strategy to pit but nobody in the team, including myself, though it was the right thing to do at the time,” he said.Hamilton was not willing to apportion blame. “I just struggled with the car,” he said. “Rather than blaming strategy, I was uncomfortable in the car this weekend. The lack of pace, I have to take it upon myself to figure out.”Vettel’s day, serene at the opening, went downhill from the moment he lost the lead. Verstappen, charging once again after his off, was too hot into the hairpin, locked up and collected the German, causing them both to spin. Vettel dropped places and lost balance in the car, leaving him struggling in seventh, a position he lost to Fernando Alonso on the penultimate lap.Verstappen, facing growing criticism for poor decisions after hitting Hamilton in Bahrain, was penalised and apologised but the damage was done. “In that situation he has to change his style, otherwise it will happen again,” Vettel said. “I said to him afterwards: ‘Look, the race is long and you threw your podium away.’”The German was left ruing what might have been an extended lead in the title race but F1 was able to revel in a thrilling contest with a more than worthy winner. “Sometimes you have just got to lick the stamp and send it,” Ricciardo said colourfully of his move on Hamilton and in doing so posted notice of his intent to be a player in this year’s title fight.Verstappen finished in fourth but was classified fifth after his penalty Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in sixth, with his team-mate Carlos Sainz in ninth Alonso in seventh and Kevin Magnussen’s Haas 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6929aaead6e7937a322fa4d8cfc1f7738b20936f/0_189_5034_3021/master/5034.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=62f7233d1fdeb021a606dc60fbc03cf3 1240w","title":"marathon greats condemn games organisers over hawkins treatment","story":"Commonwealth Games organisers were heavily criticised for not providing sufficient medical assistance to a Scottish marathon runner who collapsed but was not attended to by paramedics for several minutes.Callum Hawkins was leading the marathon by almost two minutes and was less than two miles from the finish when he collapsed from heat exhaustion in 30 degree heat. The 25-year-old, who finished fourth at the World Championships marathon in London last summer, had looked set for gold but he began to sway in distress and fell over on the curb.He managed to rouse himself and briefly continued but supported himself several times using the metal barriers lining the course. But he collapsed again shortly afterwards, hitting his head on one of the roadside barriers. Hawkins was taken to hospital and is sat up and talking with no obvious long term damage done but fellow athletes and former athletes were damning of how long it took for professional assistance to arrive.Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted that there were “big questions” for the local organising committee and medical staff. “That should never happen,” she said.Some spectators even took pictures of a stricken Hawkins with nobody seeming to offer any help. Commentating on the BBC, former middle distance runner Steve Cram said it was “a disgrace” that it took so long for any paramedics to attend to Hawkins.“I’m just concerned for his welfare,” Cram said, “He hit his head on the barrier. I’m sorry if you’re watching this at home, it’s really distressing. He’s going to hurt himself and there’s nobody anywhere near. We should have some more medical attention.” “This is a guy in real distress and someone needs to recognise it for his health at this point. Where on earth is the help? You cannot just wait at the finish line. They’ve got radios. And finally somebody arrives. I think it’s disgraceful.”Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive, said: “I like many others was distressed to see a wonderful athlete like Callum collapse during the closing stages of today’s marathon. We are offering every assistance possible to Callum and Team Scotland.” “Gold Coast 2018 has put in place a wide range of measures to ensure athlete welfare and the response of medical staff this morning was within agreed response guidelines and timeframes. I was also concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images. This is not in keeping with the spirit of Gold Coast 2018.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008c6905d9cb4a1557484118541fd1ad30fe0e52/63_93_4535_2722/master/4535.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d2fb86ab405d8858084dc33b21c00bc 1240w","title":"saracens bath premiership match report","story":"• Saracens 41-6 Bath• Jonathan Joseph’s England tour place in jeopardyAnother desperate afternoon for Bath, and not a great one for England with Jonathan Joseph hobbling off with an ankle injury that may jeopardise his place on the summer tour of South\u0026nbspAfrica.For Saracens it was an emphatic bonus-point victory, confirming their place in the play-offs for the ninth season in a row, but the contrast between their resurgence and Bath’s bleak slump could not be more stark.The Bath director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, was hopeful over Joseph but he needed crutches to take his place on the bench after going off in the first half and he will be assessed in the coming days. “He’s given his ankle a really good tweak,” Blackadder said. “Hopefully it won’t be too serious.”Certainly, it is another blow for Bath in a season full of them. They are already without the England trio of Anthony Watson, Semesa Rokoduguni and Sam Underhill and a fourth successive defeat leaves them in eighth and staring down the barrel of Challenge Cup rugby next season.All told it has been a thoroughly frustrating campaign and Blackadder’s job must surely be in danger considering the directors of rugby in the four teams below Bath have all headed, or are heading, for the exit. “If somebody wants to make those decisions, it’s not something that I can control,” he said.It was not as if Bath did not show glimpses of quality but they were given an abject lesson in finishing by a Saracens side who are coming to the boil nicely. Both of their first-half tries had elements of fortune to them, however, or rather misfortune for Bath. A loose pass from Francois Louw eventually led to Schalk Brits’s try, via three penalties kicked to the corner.Owen Farrell converted and it was his covering tackle that indirectly led to Liam Williams’s try. Aled Brew burst down the left but really ought to have passed to Ben Tapuai outside him. When Bath recycled, Rhys Priestland’s pass struck the unaware Louw on his side, Nick Isiekwe gathered the loose ball and fed Williams to run nearly the length of the field.Isiekwe’s most eye-catching contribution was still to come. Taulupe Faletau showed his class with a scything break up the left and a delightful offload inside to Brew. He went back outside to Kahn Fotuali’i who looked certain to score until Isiekwe’s last-ditch tackle dragged him out of play – an intervention every bit as impressive as Underhill’s for England against Wales.Two Priestland penalties had at least got Bath on the board but Farrell nailed one of his own into the wind just before half-time and with the conditions in their favour in the second half Saracens raced through the gears. Richard Wigglesworth went over in the right-hand corner before Farrell picked off a loose pass from Priestland and cruised over to seal the bonus point.Schalk Burger and Ben Spencer were on hand for tries five and six while Saracens were able to welcome back Michael Rhodes off the bench after an injury lay-off since January. In truth, they had far too much firepower for Bath and you have to wonder why Mako Vunipola played when he was due a rest according to an agreement between the Premiership and the Rugby Football Union. He was excellent again but you get the feeling Saracens would have been fine without him.He and the rest of the squad do at least have a week off now, and they are then set to have Billy Vunipola back at their disposal for the run-in. Exeter are setting the pace but Saracens are going to take some stopping. “There’s real determination to finish the season well,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “We’re in a good position, we seem to be getting people healthy at the right time as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9288c3dd9bc88d24e9ca69b0e826d225e3f3975f/0_0_2106_1374/master/2106.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ca54ce78a294c9910fe9203bf3baf00 720w","title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Its presenter, Will Millard, an upbeat writer and expedition leader who seems cut from the cloth of 90s Jamie Oliver, sets out to West Papua in Indonesia to document the holy grail sought by many anthropological documentary-makers – a society untouched by the modern world. Millard has visited the region many times before and speaks Indonesian, but he has yet to meet the remote Korowai people. So, he heads into the rainforest without any fixed plans, in the hope that a “traditional” family will let him film with them for a sustained period. “I want to try something different,” he explains, aware that this has been attempted before, offering four visits over the course of a year as his USP.The twist has been revealed in advance and picked over in the papers already. The Korowai are not as remote a tribe as they once were. They have smartphones, generators and a school. Many of their famous treehouses, built high off the rainforest floor, were constructed for the benefit of previous documentaries, including the BBC’s 2011 series Human Planet. With a growing sense of confusion and disappointment, Millard realises he is being performed to by the people he meets. First, there is Markus, who assumes the role of a treehouse-dweller, but it soon becomes clear that this is a show for the cameras. Markus has a list of prices for “activities”, from hunting for grubs to cooking rat. He sings as he is cooking a meal: “We weren’t like this before.”But Markus is not the only one in on this presentation of tribe life. In the end, we are left with the shell of the documentary that Millard thought he was going to make, propped up by an existential crisis about authenticity, artifice and encroaching modernity.As fascinating as that is, it left me uneasy. Much of the first episode seems more concerned with Millard’s feelings about his thwarted adventure than with the people who have intrigued him for so long. That may be a result of necessity. Once it becomes clear that the Korowai have seen wide-eyed film crews plenty of times before, the focus of the documentary becomes documentary-making. It turns into an ethical quagmire and I am not sure that My Year With the Tribe escapes from it simply by addressing that fact.There is a paradox in Millard’s despair. He seems frustrated that a cash economy, which he puts down to outside visitors, has changed what he had hoped to find. There is some agonised self-flagellation about being part of the problem – “Look around you, mate, you made this” – but he remains determined to be the person to find the remote tribe that has eluded him, in spite of the fact that the search for it turns into “a bit of a disaster” in places, as he admits. Having seen the effects of documentaries such as this being made again and again, he continues to attempt to make one. Perhaps this will be addressed in the remaining two episodes, but something about this jarringly frank series makes me wonder if it will be the last of its kind – and whether that would be such a bad thing.After a well-received pilot, the sketch show Famalam (BBC Two) has been given a four-episode series, first shown online on BBC Three. It is good-natured, daft and occasionally incisive, with its initial sketch laying out its wry wit to particularly sharp effect: a black superhero takes out a gang of drug dealers and stands, triumphantly and expectantly, as the police arrive on the scene. Cut to him being thrown across the bonnet of the car, in cuffs, as “suspect: black male” crackles across the radio and the dealers are handed hot chocolate and blankets.Plenty has been written about how sketch comedy has been revived by the internet’s appetite for brief, shareable clips (one of the stars of Famalam, Tom Moutchi, made his name on Vine) and this certainly feels as if it could exist in isolated, Facebook-friendly bursts. The sketches are rapid-fire and rarely outstay their welcome. Some, like the gag about racist swiping on dating apps, are one-note jokes that pass in a flash. Others, such as the Blaxploitation-flecked countryside crime of Midsomer Motherfuckin’ Murders, luxuriate in a more drawn-out silliness. My favourite was the aunties’ western-inspired showdown over leftovers. It is not hard to see Famalam’s punchlines coming long before they land, but they fly past in such a frenzy of energy that it is hard to mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01d63b2c31f245b0a4650188f5bb3e67f7513b47/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70ffc8538f92a73bf4492197d797bcd2 1240w","title":"five things james comey interview","story":"The former FBI director was not afraid to talk in detail about Donald Trump, his own family and the alleged pee tapeFormer FBI director James Comey has taken part in his first televised interview since the release of his book about his dealings with Donald Trump, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership. Speaking to ABC’s George Stephanopolous, Comey came out swinging, describing Donald Trump as “morally unfit” to be president. He also talked about impeachment, the Hillary letter and a president who he says “lies constantly”. Here are the key things we learned:Prime-time television, a medium that Donald Trump understands, is attracting interviewees ready to deliver damning verdicts on the US president. But whereas Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were describing alleged affairs from years ago, James Comey is the former director of the FBI. As Anderson Cooper of CNN put it: “Somebody who’s actually been in the room with him, seen it from the inside.” And his account to George Stephanopoulos was as brutal as any heard from a former government official talking about an American president: “A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it: that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.”• Comey is not afraid to get personal, maybe too personalComey’s recollection of his first meeting with Trump was vivid and colourful, with small details that are perhaps calculated to demonstrate the reliability of his memory. “He looked shorter to me than he did on television, but otherwise exactly the same ... He had impressively coiffed hair, it looks to be all his. I confess, I stared at it pretty closely and my reaction was, ‘It must take a heck of a lot of time in the morning, but it’s impressively coiffed.’ His tie was too long, as it always is. He looked slightly orange up close with small, white, half moons under his eyes, which I assume are from tanning googles.” This is catnip for Never Trumpers, confirming every scornful suspicion, raising a laugh with audiences and selling books. But the insults could also be counterproductive, suggesting Comey is willing roll in the mud with Trump and handing ammunition to his supporters.• Yes, he will talk about prostitutes and the supposed pee tapeWhether motivated by a desire for transparency, animus towards Trump or an eye for publicity, Comey is willing to speak candidly about the so-called Steele dossier, which contained the salacious – and unverified – allegation that the Russian government has video of Trump watching prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. Comey recalls that when he first briefed the incoming president on it during the transition, Trump replied: “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” And Comey carefully leaves the issue hanging: “I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. It’s possible, but I don’t know.”• When it comes to the Hillary Clinton letter, he believes he did the right thingMany Hillary Clinton supporters have still not forgiven Comey for his handling of the investigation into the former secretary of state’s use of a private email server. Stephanopoulos challenged: “Your critics say this is where your ego got the best of you. This was your original sin?” Comey is not apologising. He said he was in a “no win” situation. Asked if he would still send the 28 October letter, which announced the FBI was looking back into the Clinton investigation just days before the election, Comey admitted he must have been influenced by the assumption she would win but that he would do it again. “If I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we’re done. We’re just another player in the tribal battle.”• Life in the Comey household must have been awkward after the electionEarly in the interview, Comey said he did not vote in the presidential election, explaining: “I’m the director of the FBI. I’m trying to be outside of politics so intentionally tried not to follow it a lot.” But he said his wife, Patrice, and his four daughters all wanted Clinton to win and took part in the 2017 women’s march in Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration. Patrice told Stephanopoulos: “I wanted a woman president really badly, and I supported Hillary Clinton. A lot of my friends worked for her. And I was devastated when she lost.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures.

It is in our national interest to prevent the further use of chemical weapons in Syria and to uphold and defend the global consensus that these weapons should not be used.”She is expected to add: “We have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do. And we are not alone. There is broad-based international support for the action we have taken,”pointing out that she has secured the support of a string of world leaders.May will give a statement to MPs on Monday afternoon, after refusing to recall parliament last week to seek MPs’ approval before action was taken.Her remarks will come after Jeremy Corbyn described the attack on Syria as “both wrong and misconceived”.In an article for the Guardian, the Labour leader said the attack by the west was “either purely symbolic – a demolition of empty buildings, already shown to be entirely ineffective as a deterrent. Or it was the precursor to wider military action. That would risk a reckless escalation of the war and death toll, and the danger of direct confrontation between the US and Russia. Neither possibility offers an end to the war and suffering, or any prospect of saving lives – rather the opposite.”He also took aim at the foreign secretary, saying: “Boris Johnson’s blithe acceptance that the conflict will now continue on its current course and that peace negotiations would be an ‘extra’ is an unconscionable abdication of responsibility and morality.” In further remarks that could prove controversial after the Salisbury poisoning, Corbyn also called for “a shift from the rhetoric of endless confrontation with Russia”, which he said could “help lower the temperature, and make a UN consensus for multilateral action to end Syria’s agony more likely”.The government has also announced that it will urge the Speaker, John Bercow, to grant an emergency debate afterwards, to allow more time to be set aside for MPs to express their views.The debate would be aimed at preempting attempts by Labour and the Scottish National party to force a vote on the decision to trigger action – though Conservative MPs have been issued a three-line whip on Tuesday in case opposition parties succeed.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused the prime minister of failing to consult parliament because she feared losing a vote. “Theresa May had a chance to try and persuade parliament but bottled out of it through weakness,” he said.May will pledge a further diplomatic push to bring the Assad regime back to the negotiating table in Geneva, and ensure chemical weapons attacks are fully investigated.Senior government ministers were out in force over weekend, seeking to explain the rationale behind the bombing raids, with Johnson insisting they were “timely, appropriate and commensurate”.He said the airstrikes were aimed narrowly at sending a signal to the Syrian regime that the use of chemical weapons was unacceptable – not on seeking to resolve the wider conflict.“There’s one overwhelming reason why this was the right thing to do, and that is to deter the use of chemical weapons, not just by the Assad regime but around the world,” he said, describing the action as a response not only to the Douma attack but repeated use of chemical weapons in Syria in the past few years. “Finally the world has said, enough is enough,” he told BBC1’s the Andrew Marr Show.He added: “It’s important that we understand the limits of what we are trying to do. This is not going to turn the tide of the conflict in Syria one can hope it encourages the Russians to the negotiating table in Geneva, to get a political process properly going – but that is, as it were, an extra. The primary purpose is to say no to the use of barbaric chemical weapons.”Johnson also stoked fears of reprisals by Russia, saying the UK had to “take every possible precaution” to prepare for possible revenge cyber attacks on targets such as the NHS and electrical facilities. May is expected to face questions from Tory MPs anxious about the potential consequences of Saturday’s raids, the government’s plan for tackling the broader Syrian conflict and the decision to ignore the recent convention of seeking parliament’s approval before military action.Labour backbenchers with a longstanding interest in the Syria conflict, including the Wirral South MP Alison McGovern, are also likely to pursue the question of what more the UK could and should be doing to ensure the safety of civilians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8241a47c5971917604914feae373ebaf54885a0/66_234_1337_802/master/1337.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82e683bec083e27128832807e2d46212 1240w","title":"belgium comes to terms with human zoos of its colonial past","story":"Sixty years ago, Belgium set up a live display of people from Congo for the 1958 world fair. Now the country is rethinking that legacySixty years ago on Tuesday, Belgium staged the opening of the 1958 world fair, a glittering 200-day celebration of postwar social, cultural and technological advances.It is said to retain an “important place in the collective memory of the Belgian nation”. A series of events are being held in the Atomium, the futuristic landmark built for the spectacle, in recognition.Yet as the Belgian capital indulges in nostalgia, one exhibit staged at the time is not being revisited: a live display of black men, women and children in “native conditions” laid on for the education and amusement of white Europeans.It was the world’s last “human zoo”.As of 1958, Belgium still ruled Congo, a piece of territory some 80 times its own size, and a source of great pride to the country. The mineral-rich central African state was not only hugely economically rewarding but garlanded Belgium, a small European nation in the shadows of Britain and France, with standing in the world.Expo ’58 was seen by Belgian politicians as a chance to burnish this achievement, sealing what was seen as a special bond with Belgian Congo.At the foot of the Atomium, a rejoinder to Paris’s Eiffel Tower, and the centre piece of the exhibition, eight hectares of land peppered by seven pavilions were dedicated to the themes of mining in Congo, its arts, transport and agriculture, among others. It was known as the Kongorama. In its three hectares of tropical gardens, Congolese men, women and children were put on show day-after-day, in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence.Human zoos were in no way a novelty to the west and had been held regularly earlier in the century in London, Paris, Oslo and Hamburg. In New York in 1906, a young Congolese man with sharpened teeth was given a home in the monkey house in the Bronx zoo.In the summer of 1897, King Leopold II had imported 267 Congolese to Brussels to be on show around his colonial palace in Tervuren, east of Brussels, paddling in their canoes on the royal lakes 1.3 million Belgians, out of a population of 4 million, visited, walking over a rope bridge to get the best view.That summer was bitterly cold and seven of the Congolese died of pneumonia and influenza, their bodies dumped in an unmarked mass grave in the local cemetery. But such was the popularity of the zoo and other exhibits that a permanent exhibition was to be later established at the site. Initially called the Museum of the Congo, it is now the Royal Museum for Central Africa.The 1958 exhibit was smaller in scale, but similar in content. A “typical” village was set up, where the Congolese spent their days carrying out their crafts by straw huts while they were mocked by the white men and women who stood at the edge.“If there was no reaction, they threw money or bananas over the closure of bamboo,” one journalist wrote at the time of the spectators.Another report told of people gossiping about “seeing the negros at the zoological gardens”.The Congolese on display were among 598 people – including 273 men, 128 women and 197 children, a total of 183 families – brought over from Africa to staff the wider fair.The colonial office was “very nervous about what this stay of such an unprecedented number of Congolese in Belgium might do”, according to Dr Sarah Van Beurden, a historian of central Africa.But housed in a dedicated building isolated from the Expo from which they could be bussed in and out, the Congolese complained of cramped accommodation, the strict limitations on visitors or excursions from the building, and, of course, daily abuse at the fair.By July, the Congolese artists and artisans, and their families, could take no more and some went back home. The human zoo, as the Congolese recognised it to be, closed down, and the rest of the fair carried on.Such a zoo was not to be staged anywhere again, and in January 1959, Congo won its independence. But for Guido Gryseels, the director general at the Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA), the permanent exhibition that grew from 1897, combating the prejudices that were at the core of the zoo and still, he says, persist, is the focus of his working life.On 1 December, following a €75m renovation, the RMCA will reopen five years after it last opened its doors to the public. There is a new visitors centreand a vast underground space that has doubled the museum’s exhibition area to 11,000 sq metres. But beyond the physical transformation, a much more significant change is about to be undertaken.When Gryseels took over the museum in 2001, the permanent exhibition had barely changed since the 1920s, he said. Along with Leopold II’s double L motifs looking down on visitors in almost every room, and the royal quotations celebrating the higher moral plane of the colonisation, the story that was told was of Belgium bringing light where there was darkness.“For 100 years we have been a colonial institution”, Gryseels said. “For most Belgians their first encounter with Africa is our museum. The initial impression of Africa by most Belgians was made here in this museum, and that is that the white person is better than the black person. We were there to civilise them. The Africans we portray here are naked with a spear without a culture of their own.”A reason for the inertia at the museum, he believes, is that in reality Belgian society has not wanted to rethink its colonial past. “It is very emotional here because every Belgian family has a family member who worked in Congo. All of them. A missionary, a teacher, an administrator. You ask any Belgian and they all have. So it is a very emotional debate.”There are some voices from the Congolese diaspora calling for the “decolonisation” of his institution, and its closure. But Gryseels says his job in the next nine months is to tell a new story about Belgium in the Congo.On the opening day, the minister of foreign affairs is expected to give a speech on Belgium’s colonial past in the presence of the royal family. “We have a responsibility for cultivating an attitude that a lot of Belgians have of being superior to black people”, Gryseels said. “And that is changing. But it is going to take a while.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6538c72f9de112114d1487634da3bbf2cd74cf0/0_23_4192_2517/master/4192.jpg?w=4000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35fff38ee40e6947733a92c7e527b61f 8000w","title":"monday briefing may faces syria aftermath","story":"PM will seek to justify strikes against Assad regime ...

She is expected to point out that “there is broad-based international support for the action we have taken”. The PM will also pledge a further diplomatic push to bring Bashar al-Assad’s regime back to the negotiating table in Geneva, and ensure chemical weapons attacks are fully investigated. Senior government ministers were out in force over the weekend, seeking to explain the rationale behind Saturday’s action, with the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, insisting the missile strikes on chemical weapons facilities were “timely, appropriate and commensurate”.Jeremy Corbyn, in an opinion piece for the Guardian, has said the attack was “legally questionable” and either entirely ineffective as a deterrent or a precursor to wider military action. “Neither possibility offers an end to the war and suffering, or any prospect of saving lives – rather the opposite. The intensification of military action will simply lead to more deaths and more refugees,” he wrote. He also called for the restoration of a UN chemical weapons inspections regime.Across the Channel, Emmanuel Macron has used the strikes to burnish his military credentials, and has even boasted during an interview that he steered Donald Trump on the best action to take in Syria, Trump, the ‘stain’ – James Comey has launched a broadside against Donald Trump’s character, saying he is “morally unfit” to be president, treats women like meat and is a “stain” on everyone who worked for him. The former FBI director – who Trump has variously called a “leaker”, “liar”, “slippery” and a “slimeball” – was giving his first TV interview since the launch of his new book, A Higher Loyalty. Other highlights include Comey’s analysis of Trump’s hair and skin, the difficulty of briefing him on claims he had been in a Moscow hotel room with urinating prostitutes and the decision to reopen the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry. Richard Wolffe writes that Comey helped Trump to power, now he wants to undo the deed.Stephen Lawrence – The father of the teenager stabbed to death 25 years ago in an infamous racially motivated attack has forgiven his son’s killers, saying they had inadvertently “created a legend”. Neville Lawrence said Stephen’s murder in south-east London had sparked debate about racism and policing, and he was now motivated to speak about the recent surge in knife crime. “It is even more urgent now that I talk to these youngsters and explain to them the pain and the suffering they inflict on families,” he said. Danny Leigh spoke to Duwayne Brooks, who was with Stephen Lawrence when he died.The ultimate Tess – An ambitious search for alien worlds begins on Monday, weather permitting, with the launch of Nasa’s planet-hunting spacecraft, Tess.

Some diplomats feel the UK is not taking seriously a problem that is affecting large numbers of long-term UK residents who came to Britain as children. Some have been threatened with deportation to countries they left as children 50 years ago. Others have been denied access to healthcare, lost jobs or been made homeless.Harmony in, homosexuality out – Weibo, China’s Twitter equivalent, has banned “homosexual” content from its platform, saying it wants to create a “harmonious community environment”. The move sparked outcry, mostly under the hashtag #iamgay, with many referring to China’s constitution, which says citizens’ “personal dignity” is “inviolable”. China’s online space has come under increasingly tighter control. In January, authorities ordered Sina Weibo to shut several portals to eliminate “vulgar” or “harmful” online content.Nearly 60 years ago, Belgium staged a glittering 200-day celebration of postwar social, cultural and technological advances. The event, which is said to retain an “important place in the collective memory of the Belgian nation”, is being honoured this week but one of its exhibits not so much – the world’s last “human zoo”. In three hectares of tropical gardens, the colonial power put Congolese men, women and children on show in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence for the education and amusement of white Europeans. They would spend their days carrying out their crafts by straw huts while they were mocked by visitors. “If there was no reaction, they threw money or bananas over the closure,” one journalist wrote at the time. For Guido Gryseels, the head of Belgium’s Royal Museum for Central Africa, combating the prejudices at the core of the zoo remains the focus of his work.Pep Guardiola’s champions will go down in history as one of the best to grace English football, writes Jonathan Wilson. Yes, City outlaid a net £360m under Guardiola but he has also improved players and blended them to accentuate their assets.

The missile strikes on Syria appeared to have little impact on trading, with all eyes on Chinese GDP data, due on Tuesday.The pound is buying $1.425 and €1.155.There are two stories in town today, according to the front pages: fears of a Russian “cyber war” on Britain and Manchester City’s triumph over Manchester United.The Mail, Mirror, Telegraph and Express all splash on fears that Moscow will use hackers and trolls to retaliate against the UK for the US-led strikes on Syria over the weekend. Most of the front-page stories quote Boris Johnson saying the UK has to “take every possible precaution” to prepare for possible revenge cyber-attacks on targets such as the NHS and electrical facilities. The fallout from the Syria strikes also makes the FT front, with the paper leading on “Trump vows to follow air strikes with more sanctions on Russia”. The Guardian splashes on the prime minister defending her decision to act: “May hits back at critics: bombing Syria was ‘in our national interest’”, as does the Sun with its lead story: “Back me or back brutality”.Singing a different tune is the Times, which has a story about patients deciding how they spend NHS money as a result of a huge expansion of personal health budgets.For more news: www.theguardian.comThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested to British prime minister Theresa May earlier this year that their cabinets hold annual joint meetings to bolster the relationship between both countries post-Brexit.When Mr Varadkar and Ms May both visited Belfast in February, he suggested to her that an annual meeting involving all the ministers from both governments could act as a replacement for the regular engagements which currently happen in an EU context.The Taoiseach said he had in mind an arrangement similar to the yearly meeting involving the French and German cabinets, which has reinforced their status as the two central powers in the European Union.He said the prime minister had received the suggestion positively. However, she gave no firm indication if she would be agreeable to such a scenario.The Taoiseach disclosed the proposal in public for the first time during the course of an internal Fine Gael “town hall” meeting in Mountmellick, Co Laois last Friday.Mr Varadkar said EU Council meetings ensured he could have one-to-one discussions with Ms May five or six times a year.Referring to the post-Brexit situation, he said: “If you do not have those regular meetings and engagements, those relationships decline. We will have to make a special effort to keep a close relationship with Britain.“I proposed to prime minister May that once a year there could be a joint cabinet, just like the French and Germans do.”The Taoiseach’s spokesman said he was of the view that when the United Kingdom leaves Europe, there will not be the same level of interaction between both governments. He said that existing organisations such as the British Irish Council and other bodies had specific roles, many arising from the Belfast Agreement. An annual cabinet meeting would allow other issues fundamental to the political and trading relationship between both countries to be discussed.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462566.1523813034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps could delay brexit with final deal renegotiation demand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople’s Vote: the MPs Caroline Lucas, Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry want a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGettyMPs could delay Brexit if they are unhappy with a final deal by sending the British government back to Brussels to renegotiate it, according to a new analysis of the role of parliament in the process.A report by the Institute for Government, a think tank close to Whitehall, rejects the assertion by Theresa May’s government that MPs will face a choice between endorsing the deal or leaving the EU with no agreement at all.“The government has a massive political incentive to talk up the chaos that would ensue if parliament did anything other than approve its deal. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear ministers arguing that the only alternative is to leave the EU without a deal – meaning no transition period and no legal guarantees for UK and EU citizens,” said Raphael Hogarth, one of the report’s authors.“The facts, however, are messier. If parliamentarians object to a particular bit of the deal, or to all of it, they could ask the government to renegotiate. The real questions then would be political: could the present government survive this, and would the EU 27 be prepared to return to the table?”The UK and the EU hope to reach agreement by October on two major documents outlining the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the union and its future relationship with the European Union.The withdrawal agreement, a treaty setting out the terms of the UK’s exit for the short to medium term, will have the force of international law once it is signed and ratified. The second document is the “framework for a future relationship”, a political declaration on the terms of the UK’s long-term relationship with the EU.The government has promised to put the withdrawal agreement and future framework, together, to a “meaningful vote” in parliament. If the motion is approved it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill, which will enshrine the agreement in British law.The Institute for Government report says that, although MPs will not be able to amend the withdrawal agreement itself, they can attach amendments to the “meaningful vote” motion obliging the government to seek a better deal.“MPs can force ministers back to the negotiating table and, if they do, the government’s timetable could be unachievable. If MPs were to send ministers back to Brussels to ask for significant changes to the deal, it is likely that Brexit would have to be delayed,” said Hannah White, another of the report’s authors.More than 1,000 people attended the launch in London on Sunday of the People’s Vote, a campaign to put the Brexit deal to the people in a referendum. MPs from four parties were at the launch, including the Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna of Labour, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran.“We have got to get a majority in the House of Commons for the proposition of this people’s vote,” Mr Umunna said. “That means at the very least my party, the Labour Party, needs to be true to its values and support this.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462394.1523798421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"washington we need an exorcist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Exorcist: William Friedkin at the steps where he filmed his horror film’s climatic scene, in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington. Photograph: Gabriella DemczukNew York TimesWhen you’ve got a demonic child in Washington splattering dark stinking bile, croaking gibberish, spewing vulgar personal attacks, lying to sow confusion, whining about the unfairness of the attempts of righteous men to compel the diabolical behaviour and head-spinning outbursts to stop, who do you call? The demon-buster himself, of course: William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist.Before Donald Trump became president the most frightening thing that happened in the US capital was The Exorcist, which brags on its DVD cover that it’s the scariest film of all time. It could well be, if the measure is moviegoers putting down their popcorn in unison when Linda Blair gushes green vomit. “That was oatmeal – the pea soup was just for colouring,” the 82-year-old Friedkin tells me as we have lunch at 1789 in Georgetown, Washington, a restaurant opposite the steep concrete steps where Jason Miller’s tortured Fr Karras fell to his death in a violent struggle with the demon.Friedkin offers an eerie connection to the Trump White House, noting that he edited the film at 666 Fifth Avenue, the accursed Manhattan building with the Number of the Beast at the centre of Jared Kushner’s money problems. The book and screenplay were written by William Peter Blatty, inspired by a news story he heard about in a religious class: the 1949 case of a 14-year-old boy in a Maryland suburb of Washington.Objects appeared to move around on their own in the boy’s bedroom, and he was violent and speaking Latin phrases. The boy, a Lutheran who grew up to be an engineer at Nasa, underwent an exorcism, first with a priest from Georgetown University and then with priests in St Louis.After studying up on the case Friedkin has decided it was “jive”. “It just doesn’t hold water,” he says, eating asparagus soup that looks enough like what came out of Linda Blair’s mouth to make me a little queasy.Friedkin’s career peaked in the early 1970s with The Exorcist and another blockbuster, The French Connection. Eventually he felt so out of touch with a Hollywood possessed by comic books and sci-fis that he began directing operas. Now he has returned to the subject that haunts him with a documentary called The Devil and Father Amorth, opening this month.Friedkin used a handheld camera to film an interview with Fr Amorth, the chief Vatican exorcist, who worried that “Satan rules the world” and was in the Vatican. He died in 2016, at 91. The director, who had never seen an exorcism, also talked the priest into letting him film the exorcism of an Italian architect named Christina with whom he had done the ancient ritual many times.“It was harrowing,” Friedkin says. “These five strong guys are holding her down. They’re sweating. Fr Amorth told me that during one of the exorcisms she accused him of his sins and they were real.”Friedkin took this footage to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists, and one psychiatrist challenged it, saying Christina did not show “the classic symptoms” of possession, such as her head turning 360 degrees and her body levitating.“I said, ‘Doctor, we made that up,’” Friedkin recalls dryly. “Blatty invented what we think of as possession and exorcism today, and I had to find a way to film it. Fr Amorth never encountered stuff like that, but he encountered other extraordinary occurrences and personality changes and voice changes. But there was no levitation or head spinning.”The film-maker says that for his documentary he did nothing to amplify the guttural growl of Christina, which evokes the terrifying voice used by Mercedes McCambridge, which was dubbed in for Blair’s in the possession scenes.“When she breathed into the mic you’d hear five or six sounds come out at once, like John Coltrane playing the sax,” he says. “When I first called her she said, ‘I’m in AA. I had a serious drinking problem. I am a lapsed Catholic, but I still have strong ties to the church. So in order to do what you want I’m going to have to start drinking Jack Daniel’s again and smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs.’ And she wanted to have her own two priests with her at all times.”Friedkin is chock-a-block with such tales. He says the first of his four wives, Jeanne Moreau, installed a lifelong love of Proust in him by reading it aloud. Happily married to Sherry Lansing for 26 years, Friedkin says, he wasn’t really “Hollywood’s most combustible director”, as the Telegraph once called him. “I don’t drink,” he says. “I’ve never done drugs. I’ve never tried grass. But I think Miles Davis is a reason to live.”He does cop to slapping a couple of people to get the sad and angry performances he wanted, noting that another word for director is “manipulator”.He did not want Gene Hackman to play the iconic New York police detective Popeye Doyle in The French Connection. He gave the role to Jimmy Breslin instead. “He had exactly the look I had in mind, a Black Irishman,” Friedkin says.“The first day he was great, great, great. The second day he forgot what he did on the first day. The third day he didn’t show up. Comes Friday he shows up and says, ‘Hey, isn’t there a car chase in this movie?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘You know, I promised my mother on her deathbed I wouldn’t drive, so I don’t know how to drive.’ I said, ‘You’re fired.’ ”He gave Hackman the part, and they sparred so much during filming that at the end he told a producer: “I may get away with this thing, but if I had to do The Gene Hackman Story I wouldn’t hire this guy.” He acknowledges now that Hackman is one of the greatest American film actors.After lunch Friedkin makes me descend the Stairway to Hell, the 75 steps in the movie’s climactic scene that I had avoided my whole life. I saw The Exorcist on my 21st birthday and was so unnerved I went to bed and missed my own party.Standing on the steps, Friedkin channels the demon, growling, “Your mother still rots in hell, Karras, you faithless slime.” Tourists taking selfies on the stairs look around, startled. And even all these years later I still want to crawl under the covers. – New York TimesThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

After ibuprofen exposure, the number of cells was almost halved.And testicular tissue exposed to painkillers in a culture dish had around a quarter fewer sperm-producing cells after exposure to paracetamol or ibuprofen.Scientists at the University of Edinburgh looked at the effects of paracetamol and ibuprofen on samples of human fetal testes and ovaries. They found similar effects using several different experimental approaches, including lab tests on human tissue samples and animal studies.Human tissues exposed to either drug for one week in a dish had reduced numbers of cells that give rise to sperm and eggs, called germ cells, the study found.Girls produce all of their eggs in the womb, so if they are born with a reduced number it could lead to an early menopause.The team also tested the effects of painkiller treatment on mice that carried grafts of human fetal testicular tissue. These grafts have been shown to mimic how the testes grow and function during development in the womb.Painkillers could harm future fertility of subsequent offspringAfter just one day of treatment with a human-equivalent dose of paracetamol, the number of sperm-producing cells in the graft tissue had dropped by 17 per cent. After a week of drug treatment, there were almost one third fewer cells.Previous studies with rats have shown that painkillers administered in pregnancy led to a reduction in germ cells in female offspring. This affected their fertility and the fertility of females in subsequent generations.The scientists found that exposure to paracetamol or ibuprofen triggers mechanisms in the cell that make changes in the structure of DNA, called epigenetic marks.These marks can be inherited, helping to explain how the effects of painkillers on fertility may be passed on to future generations.The effects were likely to be caused by the impact on molecules called prostaglandins, which have key functions in the ovaries and testes, researchers said.The study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, was funded by the Medical Research Council, Wellcome and the British Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes.Dr Rod Mitchell, who led the research at the University of Edinburgh’s MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, said: “We would encourage women to think carefully before taking painkillers in pregnancy and to follow existing guidelines – taking the lowest possible dose for the shortest time possible.”Recent French research found that taking ibuprofen for just two days during pregenancy was enough to result in fertility problems in subsequent female children born. Even if women stop taking the painkiller, the damage is irreversible, scientists warned.The NHS advises pregnant women to avoid ibuprofen during the first six months, because it has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage. If pain relief is required, paracetamol is advised, with the “lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible” recommended. Pregnant women are categorically told not to take ibuprofen in late pregnancy, because of an increased risk of complications.Dr Channa Jayasena, senior clinical jecturer in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London, said: “Paracetamol and ibuprofen are commonly used during pregnancy.  However, over the last year, a growing number of reports have suggested that we might need to take a closer look at their safety in unborn babies. This latest study raises the possibility that paracetamol and ibuprofen may reduce the growth of the ‘germ cells’ which later become eggs or sperm in unborn babies.”She said that the study only looked at tissue in the lab, but should be considered along side other similar research.“While it is still premature to stop taking these important drugs, there is a growing case to investigate their safety for pregnant women,” she said.Dr Sarah Branch, deputy director of the MHRA’s vigilance and risk management of medicines ision, said: “Women should avoid taking medicines during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary and should speak to their doctor, midwife or pharmacist before doing so.”John Smith, chief executive of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain said: “The official NHS advice on paracetamol is that it can be used through all stages of pregnancy to reduce a high temperature (fever) and relieve pain.  This is supported by a large body of evidence from over 50 years of paracetamol use in humans.“This study also looked at the use of ibuprofen in pregnancy, however pregnant women are advised to avoid taking ibuprofen during pregnancy, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.”Please review our commenting policyOrdeal By Innocence: 10 major differences between the book and the BBC series James Comey: \u0026#39Donald Trump is morally unfit to be president and treats

wore convertible skirts could ride bikes without","story":"A sociologist has recreated Victorian cycle wear, and tested the designs on vintage bicyclesVictorian women invented “convertible skirts” with secret pulley mechanisms to allow them to cycle freely, a university academic has found.While bicycles were popular among middle and upper-class women in the nineteenth century, restrictive skirts and dresses meant that it could be dangerous to cycle.It was common for long skirts and dresses to catch in bicycle wheels, or catch in pedals.Onlookers often hurled abuse and stones at female cyclists, while conservative social attitudes meant that it was unacceptable to appear in public wearing trousers.Dr Kat Jungnickel, a senior lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, said convertible skirts allowed women to secretly switch between their walking and cycling identities without being harassed.One skirt, developed in York, converts into a fashionable Victorian capeHer research shows the invention of dresses with pulleys, concealed loops and buttons which made travel easier and safer.Women riding bicycles were able to get around more quickly, without being chaperoned in public by a man.As part of her project, Dr Jungnickel recreated some of the designs and tested them with vintage bicycles.“The bicycle in Victorian Britain is often celebrated as a vehicle of women’s liberation,” Dr Jungnickel said.“But less is noted about another vehicle through which women forged new mobile public lives – cycle wear.”Dr Jungnickel’s research is focussed on the cities of London, York, Maidenhead and Bristol, and tells the story of six women who built women’s cycling clothes.“Patented convertible cycle wear is an exciting example of women’s inventive contributions to cycling’s past,” she said.“As these stories reveal, women responded to the social, material and technical challenges to their freedom of movement with vivid creativity. They actively and directly worked with and around barriers that sought to prevent them from cycling and engaging more broadly in public life.”The Bygrave \u0026#39Convertible Skirt\u0026#39 was developed in LondonAlice Bygrave, a dressmaker from Brixton, south London, registered patents for a skirt with a dual pulley system sewn into its seams.Other designs from the era include a three-part cycling suit with a concealed system of loops and buttons to elevate the skirt, and a garment known as the Hyde Park Safety Skirt which gathered fabric at intervals by a series of side buttons.Mary and Sarah Pease, sisters from York, patented a skirt that could be quickly converted into a fashionable high-collar cape.Dr Jungnickel’s research is presented in a new book, ‘Bicycles and Bloomers’, released today.“I am delighted to have been able to recreate these inventions and to research these women, and I look forward to sharing this through my book and summer tour,” she said.Ordeal By Innocence: 10 major differences between the book and the BBC series James Comey: \u0026#39Donald Trump is morally unfit to be president and treats women like pieces of meat\u0026#39The seven best quotes from James Comey\u0026#39s TV interviewFire in tower block sends dozens fleeing for safety in Stratford, east LondonSir Patrick Stewart says his X-Men and Star Trek characters would have opposed BrexitEmmanuel Macron: France persuaded Donald Trump not to give up on SyriaStarbucks apologises as outrage grows at arrest of two black men while they waited for friendSpring could be over \u0026#39in blink of eye\u0026#39 so enjoy blooms while you can, says Royal Horticultural SocietyTaking paracetamol during pregnancy may make grandchildren infertile, research suggestsSmall cars more likely to be vandalised, figures suggestMarket trader banned from yelling about his wares because he shouts as loud as a chainsawBoy, 16, charged with murder after the body of a 14-year-old girl was found in a parkMilitary families given £246m of taxpayers\u0026#39 money to send their children to private schoolChildren should play with \u0026#39softer balls\u0026#39, charity says, as girls \u0026#39switched off sport\u0026#39 for life by competitive PE lessonsStephen Lawrence\u0026#39s father says he has finally forgiven his son\u0026#39s killers 25 years onComment: Assad and Putin must accept political solution for Syria if bloodshed is to endPatients will have the power to choose how taxpayer money for their healthcare is spent, ministers sayAssad can still gas his own people despite airstrikes, says former chemical weapons chief who fled SyriaParents \u0026#39faking marriage breakdowns\u0026#39 to get children into top primary schools in admission fraud riseComment: Western action in Syria sends a strong message, but will not really change anything We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/readmore_card/public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/11/14/gettyimages-492448472.jpg","title":"good friday agreement northern ireland twenty years divided power sharing brexit united","story":"With power sharing on life support and Brexit threatening everything, Irish unity is on the agenda like never before –\u0026nbspbut the art of compromise must be rediscovered first\u0026nbsp“Wait and see what happens,” a family friend told me recently, “but why would you stay here when things are like this?” It’s a depressingly familiar refrain often heard by people like me who came of age in a post-conflict Northern Ireland, but have seen little reconciliation since. Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We’ll just have to see how the debate goes.”In advance of Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan has tabled a small number of government amendments in response to earlier debates, but Tory insiders have been at pains to underline how they are technical in nature and do not “compromise” on the major principles of the Bill, with Conservative right-wingers keeping a close eye on proceedings.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But with pressure over the issue growing she appears to have judged it wise to allow MPs sound off.World reacts to Syria air strikesThe emergency debate has been called under procedures laid out under House of Commons Standing Order 24, which allows for a general debate.While it will give MPs the chance to air their views and make prolonged arguments and criticism of the government, it will only be accompanied by a neutral motion, such as “that the House has considered the matter of military action taken on 14 April”.Syria raids allow May to pose as patriot – but betray her weaknessUK, France and US to demand new Syria chemical weapons investigationCorbyn calls for War Powers Act to force Government to consult MPsUS says Syria used both chlorine and sarin in Douma chemical attack Syria strikes: Images show buildings turned to ruin and rubbleIt means that even if opposition MPs demand a vote on the motion, it will not necessarily affect the legitimacy of the air strikes if the government loses.The Independent understands that opposition parties are considering pushing it to a vote anyway, simply to make the point that some sort of vote should be held.Labour and other parties may also try and force their own emergency debates on Tuesday that could carry with them more substantive motions on whether the Commons should back the strikes, which if lost would create serious problems for the prime minister’s credibility.If it comes to a vote, the parliamentary arithmetic will be finely balanced for Ms May – given a handful of Tory MPs, including Zac Goldsmith and Julian Lewis, have previously demanded the Commons be allowed to vote prior to action.Syria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageSyria bombings: US, UK and French military air strikes wreckageThe wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, which was targeted by the US, UK and France air strikes.A Syrian soldier films the damage of the Syrian Scientific Research Center surrounded by papers and rubble.Firefighrers extinguish smoke that rises from the damage.

A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.The wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.

She looks at me like I’m making a big mistake – she would turn out to be right.Getting to France from Brussels to cover the rail strikes that are paralysing the country is proving rather difficult. It’s normally a breezy half an hour to Lille on a high speed TGV from The Independent’s bureau in the Belgian capital, but those few services that are still running were booked up weeks in advance. I had managed to snag a ticket on the Eurostar, but that was then cancelled too, so decide to do the entire journey by slow Belgian suburban services – which aren’t on strike despite sometimes venturing over the border into France. It would take a while, but get me there eventually, or so I thought.Eurostar cancels trains as Macron protests erupt across ParisAn hour into my journey my optimism is shattered when a smartly uniformed train guard taps me on the shoulder. “Lille?” he asks. I nod, and he explains that the connecting Belgian service I was planning to take is now cancelled and I’ll have an extra hour’s wait at Tournai, the border city where I was planning to sneak into France.I do my time at Tournai’s ornate station alongside a gaggle of other fools braving the industrial dispute, and my train to France finally pulls in. But before it has ground to a halt, déjà vu strikes. “Lille?” I turn around, and another guard is standing there. I nod, like last time. “There is no Lille… they are blocking the way.” It turns out the French rail workers have anticipated my crafty workaround and, as well as stopping French services, have now physically blockaded the tracks to prevent Belgian trains getting anywhere near France as well. Of the dozen other travellers I am standing with, one looks distraught – but most shrug and accept that this is the way of things. “It’s a strike,” one man tells me. “It’s how it goes.” My train sits empty in the station, and will go no further.British commuters may think they know about rail strikes, but the French do them properly. Workers are walking off the job for 36 days scattered throughout April, May and June, with as many as four stoppages at week. France has invested heavily in its high speed rail network since the 1970s, and the country now relies on TGV services to get things done. Why is France\u0027s transport network mired in strikes?Air France strikes see a third of flights cancelledFrance strikes: another disrupted weekend for air and rail passengersFrance to cut number of MPs by almost a thirdWhen those trains don’t work, neither does the country. About 40 per cent of rail workers have participated in the strikes so far, and SNCF, the French national railway company, says it is running just one in three services and is urging passengers to stay away. Some cities also have separate strikes on their local bus and metro systems, with workers in, for example, Rouen taking 55 minutes out a day until late April – just enough to mess up timetables. You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, but in France only around 8 per cent of workers are union members – far fewer than even in Britain, where about 25 per cent of employees pay dues. But despite the low membership across the economy, unionised workers are highly concentrated and more prepared to take direct action – like blockading international railway tracks.The reason behind the national rail strike is Emmanuel Macron’s plans to cut conditions for workers on the French railways. The government wants to end guaranteed job security and early pensions for SNCF employees, and says the move to cut workers’ compensation is the only way to reduce the €47bn in legacy debt the national rail company has on its books. But the industrial dispute has taken on wider political connotations, and has turned into a key test for Macron’s liberalising economic agenda – with comparisons inevitably drawn to Margaret Thatcher and the miners\u0027 strike.  Emmanuel Macron is not popular – but appears to have public backing on his changes to SNCF (Etienne LaurentPool Photo via AP)The French president made his first major statement on the strike in a television interview on Thursday, pledging that he would not back down. “We must go to the end, because we have to make this reform. It is indispensable. It would be hypocritical not to do it we need a strong French railway,” he told TF1. “The reform requires a little effort from everyone. Users have made efforts, prices have increased. We ask the company, SNCF, that it must reorganise.”But union leaders have taken an equally tough stance. “We\u0027re going to have a marathon if the government forces it,” Laurent Brun of the CGT rail union said on Friday after two days of talks with government negotiators. He hinted that the strike could be extended beyond its scheduled end on 28 June if the government did not back down or make concessions.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.The wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.
