On the evening of 9 September, 400 people will gather outside the doors of Waterstones’ Piccadilly store in London for the midnight release of the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, her dystopian novel-turned-feminist touchstone-turned-meme-machine.Fans, invited to dress up in the regulation ankle-length cloaks and bonnets worn by the handmaids in Atwood’s fundamentalist republic of Gilead, will snake round the block waiting for what Waterstones is calling a “one-night festival” of, immersive theatre, political speeches and themed cocktails. At 8.15pm doors will open to a four-storey Gileadean Glastonbury, featuring guest appearances from actor Romola Garai, activist Caroline Criado-Perez, Guilty Feminist podcaster Deborah Frances-White, plus a discussion of Atwood’s legacy with authors Jeanette Winterson, Elif Shafak, Neil Gaiman and AM Homes.It’s an inventive, slightly surreal programme of events that – like Atwood – is a bit political, a bit geeky, a bit cerebral and unapologetically big on silly hats. It’s the ultimate hashtaggable celebration of a novelist who in the sixth decade of her career, having written more than 50 books of fiction, poetry and criticism, has mastered both Twitter (1.9 million followers) and Instagram (82,300). You know a writer has become a global phenomenon when the support act for their launch event includes two rivals for this year’s Booker prize. Winterson and Shafak’s novels were both longlisted, along with The Testaments, back in July.At 11pm on the night of the launch, the tiny, sprite-like 79-year-old Canadian author will emerge to read the first extracts of a 432-page book that has been kept under the tightest of wraps. Only her closest associates have glimpsed the manuscript – apart from the Booker judges, who have described it as a “terrifying and exhilarating” follow-up to her 1985 novel. Publisher Liz Calder, who was one of Atwood’s longest-standing editors, is on this year’s judging panel. While she’s not allowed to reveal anything about the book’s content, she will say: “It represents not the work of a writer who might be at the end of her career but it’s like her peak, it’s amazing in that sense.”All we know is that The Testaments is set 15 years after the final scene in the first book, in which narrator Offred is hauled into a van by heavies, who might be from the resistance or the regime that extinguished so many of the human freedoms we take for granted. When Atwood leaves the stage at midnight, fans will finally lay their hands on a book many have waited 34 years to read.Atwood’s books have sold millions. She has won the Booker, for The Blind Assassin in 2000, and had five other novels shortlisted. She has yet to be given the Nobel prize for literature but that is widely seen as an error to be righted. When an embarrassed Kazuo Ishiguro was honoured with the award in 2017, he apologised to the Canadian writer: “I always thought it would be Margaret Atwood very soon and I still think that, I still hope that.”While she has been prolific throughout her career, there is little doubt that the Emmy award-winning TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale has helped make Atwood a superstar. It has connected the novelist to a vast new audience fascinated by her vivid nightmare of an America in ecological meltdown and a totalitarian regime that is systematically stripping women of hard-won rights, leaving many as little more than walking wombs. The timing has been crucial. Since the election of President Trump, the novel’s depiction of misogyny and witch-hunts feel chillingly prophetic and the red-cloaked handmaids have become an international symbol of women’s resistance.But even before these developments, the novel had become a modern classic, translated into more than 40 languages, studied in schools and adapted into a film, an opera, a ballet and a graphic novel. “I’m a serious writer,” Atwood once said. “I never expected to become a popular one.”“She couldn’t have seen that The Handmaid’s Tale would do what it did,” Winterson says. “She’s just got on with her work right from the beginning and allowed all this success to happen. But The Testaments has come at the right moment for her as well as us because she’s now a real sage.”Sage she may be but this level of ceremony, cosplay and cult worship – involving no fewer than 120 Waterstones branches – is usually reserved for long-dead authors or Harry Potter. Certainly, the craft sessions and costume competitions celebrating her new novel seem a little kitsch, especially for a writer who delivers such apocalyptic prophecies about environmental havoc, predatory capitalism and overnight assaults on human rights. However, Atwood wouldn’t necessarily see the contradiction:“She always takes herself seriously, but she has a great respect for play and inventiveness,” says her British agent, Karolina Sutton. She recalls an occasion three years ago when she accompanied Atwood to the basement of a King’s Cross pub for the Kitschies, awards that celebrate speculative fiction. The prize was a knitted octopus tentacle, so Atwood insisted they wear homemade orange molluscs on their heads. “That’s what’s unusual about her, to have someone so intellectual who is so playful.”Still, when you’re reading about totalitarianism in The Handmaid’s Tale or man-eating mutants in the Oryx and Crake trilogy or child sexbots in her 2015 novel, The Heart Goes Last, you may relish her wit and verve, but you never lose the eerie feeling that each feature of her dystopias might soon materialise in our own society – if they haven’t already. In recent years, Atwood has been hailed a prophet for creating stories about climate disaster, lab-manufactured meat, the western fertility crisis and human organs grown inside pigs, as well as societies increasingly ruled by misogynistic strongmen, years before they were on most people’s radar.“She’s always before her time. Each novel is about something people become incredibly interested in half an hour later,” says Carmen Callil, founder of Virago Press, the publisher of books by women, who back in the mid-1970s was the first to bring Atwood’s work to a UK readership. When she first met the author over a lunch at Mon Plaisir in Covent Garden, she says she found her so “ferociously clever” that she “exploded my mind”.Atwood is a writer with many gears she can turn out transfixing character studies of Victorian women, poetry about sex between snails, essays on the history of debt and apocalyptic stories about bioengineering. Many novelists only dare to write about technology once it enters the mainstream, but she is interested in it from its inception – and rarely does it feel heavy-handed because it’s never been a chore for her to explore science in her fiction. It’s a quick hop from organ harvesting to sexual intimacy to high farce.Callil says: “There is this tradition of women’s writing that uses irony and lightness of touch to deliver monstrous concepts and beliefs. It’s that ironic voice that has helped her seamlessly move from one generation of reader to the next. That is the test of a great writer.”The Handmaid’s Tale remains Atwood’s most protean novel, with so much to say about how quickly and easily democracy can be dismantled. It remains one of the finest novels ever written on the relationship between sex, power and the social position of women. The novelist Valerie Martin, who was the first person to read it in manuscript, predicted a hit: “I told her: ‘You’re going to be very rich,’” Martin says. “Usually you read speculative fiction and squirm when sex comes up but she really gets how dangerous it is.”Lennie Goodings, publisher of Virago Press, who has known Atwood since the late 1970s, agrees. “I love the sexual politics of her books. She gets sex and I think it’s because she understands power. She’s not a moralising writer but she’s a great observer and very honest. When you read her, you feel enlarged as a human being.”Many novelists have written warnings about a future that come to seem eerily prescient. But Atwood is rare in that she has been around long enough to see systems come and go, witness various waves of feminism – and the reactions against them – and managed to respond in a second book. Such longevity, and depth of experience, is a surely a new experience for a writer.Born in 1939, a few months after the outbreak of the second world war, Atwood spent much of her early years in the wilds of Canada, where her father, Carl, an entomologist, was studying leaf-eating insects. Her childhood was unusual. Her mother, also called Margaret, was a dietician who liked being in the wilds so she didn’t have to do housework. There was no mains electricity and few roads. Atwood – known as Peggy to her family and close friends – and her older brother, Harold (her sister, Ruth, was born later, in 1951), were schooled at home with textbooks that their mother obtained. If they worked through enough pages, they were left to their own devices.This isolated childhood in the wilderness made Atwood fearless and pragmatic. Martin describes how when the family were staying on an island, the writer and her brother “dug a hole for an outhouse and nobody told them to stop so they dug this really, really deep hole. It’s still there, I believe, one of the wonders of the family. She knows how to get along without anything and if you have that knowledge, it makes you not care so much about unimportant things.”By then, she had married the writer Jim Polk, a relationship that ended in orce in 1973. Shortly after, she became involved with novelist and ecological campaigner Graeme Gibson. The couple, who live in Toronto, have been devoted to each other ever since and have one daughter, Jess, born in 1976 and now an art historian who lives in Brooklyn with Atwood’s grandson.Gibson has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and also suffers problems with his legs – but friends say he still travels with Atwood. The couple are used to an itinerant lifestyle, often spending several months a year in Norwich (where Atwood writes in local bookshop cafes). Earlier this year, they went on a boat around Australia and New Zealand. However, Gibson’s health may mean Atwood has to reduce the amount of travel she undertakes. “She’s being very brave about it and so is their daughter, Jess,” Martin says. “They’re going to figure out how to deal with it as they go along.”One senses Atwood wants to seize every opportunity for fun. She delights in playing the mischievous granny, dispensing eldritch predictions. During a recent appearance at the Moon festival in Greenwich – one of many eccentric grassroots events she supports – she stood in front of a packed-out theatre and sang the opening of Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana before performing bird calls. Bets are on as to whether she will break into song or cast a spell when she appears at the National Theatre, the night after the midnight launch, to discuss The Testaments for the first time.At the event, which will be livestreamed to more than 1,500 cinemas worldwide, BBC broadcaster Samira Ahmed will chair a Q\u0026ampA session with fans who have tweeted their questions to #askatwood, and actors (including Lily James) will read extracts from the book. Tickets sold out in a day, though 500 UK cinemas will be screening the event, which the organisers claim is comparable to the popularity of a Marvel movie. Atwood may be two months shy of her 80th birthday, but her star is still on the rise, a regular fixture at red-carpet events and in women’s fashion magazines.Martin believes that now that The Handmaid’s Tale has entered popular mythology. “In some ways, the book has been spun away from her,” she says. “Perhaps what’s happening with this new novel is that she’s pulling it back in.”I ask how much control Atwood likes to have. “A lot…” Martin replies, drily, “although not consciously at all. It’s necessary to control things in her world. She pays attention and is very good at understanding market forces and what people respond to.”Such is the iron-clad security around the sequel that predicting its content is a little like writing a horoscope. Atwood has dropped a few breadcrumbs here and there. “Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book,” she has said. “Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”“That’s part of what The Handmaid’s Tale is about,” Winterson says. “How would we respond to the issue? And we probably will respond in a totalitarian way. When the first big smash hits the west, I’m sure martial law will be introduced. Given that the west has moved so sharply to the right, I can’t imagine it won’t be an excuse for those powers to shut down all the things that have worried them so far. Just as it is at the beginning of The Handmaid’s Tale, when none of the women can get money out of their bank accounts any more.”Novelist Naomi Alderman echoes the point. Atwood mentored Alderman for a year while she developed the concept for her bestselling novel The Power, a sci-fi story about what happens when teenage girls discover they have the power to electrocute others. The part of The Handmaid’s Tale that still unnerves her most is when women are robbed of their financial independence: “How simply it happens, how easily, how convincingly. Just cut off all women’s credit cards and bank cards. Just declare it illegal to employ a woman,” says Alderman. “It’s something that could happen to all of us, without any new technology needing to be invented. All it would take would be a bad government, a war, a stolen election. That possibility is never going away.”Nevertheless, when it comes to the current gender wars, Atwood refuses to stick to a feminist script. She has faced a backlash for calling for due process for a University of British Columbia professor who was accused of sexual misconduct last year. But she has always expressed ambivalence about the feminist tag.Goodings says there is nothing “sloppy” or “sentimental” about her view of women: “She is so much about equality but one thing she always says is that if women are going to be equal to men, we must also see that they do bad things too. There was a school of feminism that felt sisterhood was everything and that if women ruled the world, it would be entirely different, but she doesn’t have much truck with that. She’s pro-women but she doesn’t want to whitewash the truth.”Martin says Atwood isn’t necessarily comfortable with the idea of being a famous feminist. “It’s sad how some people absorb what they find in her work on such a banal level,” she says. “People who dress in costumes and go stand around the street is sad to me. When she talks about power, she’s careful to make clear that the women are in power as well and what we’re talking about is human tendencies, not just male and female tendencies. But obviously the condition of women historically is of interest to her.”Winterson believes Atwood is a “proper feminist” because she has helped champion so many other women – but can understand why she has resisted the term. “It’s the fear of being labelled, just as she resisted the science-fiction label and wanted to call it ‘speculative fiction’. Labels are annoying and usually they are limiting. I used to hate being called a gay writer because I knew damn well it was about patronising men trying to limit the scope of the work.”“No one will influence her choices,” says Karolina Sutton. “She doesn’t chase trends, she’s not interested in following success. If there’s something that interests her about humanity she will write about it.” Sutton, an agent with many big-name authors on her roster, says she has never met anyone as “superhuman” as Atwood. “She’s ahead of everyone in the room… she doesn’t make mistakes. She’ll be asked to write a 3,000-word piece about a subject that’s just thrown at her – on plastics or the Russian revolution. If there’s a phone at hand, she will do it.”Friends say she can be very tough. “I’ve seen her make strong women quail,” says Calder. But they all speak of her generosity. “She’s big-hearted,” Winterson says, “and the older I get, the more important I think that is, to be big-hearted towards life and not worry too much about your own position within it.” Atwood also likes a prank. Alderman says that the day after they first met, she tricked her into thinking she could speak Anglo-Saxon. “It seemed believable! Who was I to say? She got a good laugh out of that one.”Atwood is reportedly in good health and has always been disciplined about her diet. Martin jokes that she is so productive – baking pies, hosting large dinners, knitting sweaters, signing books and lending support to charities and community campaigns – that she must have a secret double chained to a desk in a windowless room in Saskatchewan, maniacally typing her manuscripts. “I’ve spent a lot of time with her, days on end, and I never see her write!” Martin laughs. “I don’t get when she does it! I think she’s made out of space-age plastic or something.”Calder, who was Atwood’s UK editor in the 1980s and 90s, notes that she constantly renews her working methods. She was the first person to use the story-sharing website Wattpad she even invented, with her stepson, a remote book-signing device called the LongPen that allows her to sign books for fans all over the world. Calder also describes how one year, Atwood decided to overhaul the process by which her books were edited, having grown fed up with responding to different editors around the world: she called a summit. “We all trooped to Toronto where she presented us each with the new manuscript which was beautifully tied up with a blue bow. We read solidly for two days without consultation and we didn’t discuss it until we had to put our suggestions to her – it was immensely practical.”The “summits” continue to this day, and often conclude with a snowy walk to her house for supper. In January, a smaller group flew to Toronto, where it was minus 20C, to discuss The Testaments. Sutton says: “It’s an editorial process like no other and she makes it very special for everyone. There’s always more theatre, it’s more creative. But no one can dictate to Margaret Atwood! She will say: ‘Well, everyone wants it to be a different book but it is my book and it is what it is.’”Atwood might joke that “all the books are compensation for being short” but she’s rarely self-deprecating. Goodings says she’s not embarrassed by her power. “She wields it cleverly, I think. She’s still very ambitious.” Without her, the end of the world wouldn’t be half so entertaining.The Testaments is published by Vintage (£20).

It’s strictly “pink-collar” labour, yet while her barista girlfriend throws herself into ambitious art projects at the end of each shift, Ella is happy to simply go home and cook dinner. Her contentment makes her an almost subversive heroine. More problematically, it saps the drive of a meandering narrative that’s shaped by the decline of one of her charges: Jill, a middle-aged social worker left brain-damaged by an accident. There’s a disjointedness here that perhaps comes with the territory, but spiky insights into sexuality and class keep it interesting, and Jill’s husband’s unwavering spousal devotion will ultimately force Ella to rethink some of her self-protective views on love.As a founding director of Virago, cultural policy advisor to the Labour party, and chief executive of the Index on Censorship, Owen has for decades been a potent figure in the world of literature, yet as her sensitive, vital memoir reveals, she traversed radically different worlds to get there. Born to German Jews in 1937, she recalls how the family only narrowly escapes to Britain, where her mother’s mental health promptly unravels. Owen comes of age with little sense of what she herself wants, but with revolution in the air, she’s soon juggling career, motherhood and men. Look out for lively cameos from the likes of Maya Angelou, who saves her from choking on a piece of steak.A staple of HR departments, dating apps and the military, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator remains a universally popular personality test, despite having zero scientific credibility. Aptly, the tale of its invention by a mother-daughter team – one an ardent believer, the other an opportunist, neither of them trained psychologists – reads like fiction. It opens as Katharine Cook Briggs, grieving two children lost in infancy, transforms the family living room into a “cosmic laboratory of baby training” for her surviving daughter, Isabel. Years later, a grown and surprisingly well-adjusted Isabel realises that there’s money to be made from combining her mother’s newfound devotion to Jungian personality theory with some of her home laboratory methods.

The novel was notable for its relentless nastiness: at its heart is a horrific act of teenage violence (which the meal has been convened to discuss), and the adults are all equally ghastly. This grimness may be the best explanation for its success: there was a sense that Koch was holding up a mirror to bourgeois life, and revealing – none too subtly – the darkness at its heart.Koch’s latest novel is set in a broadly similar milieu. Narrator Robert Walter is the mayor of Amsterdam (one of the diners in The Dinner was a famous politician). Everything about his life seems correct, well-ordered: he is contentedly married, with a delightful teenage daughter, and his professional life involves plenty of hobnobbing with the rich and famous (Bill Clinton, he reports, is a “turbo-charged version of myself”). Aside from an intense aversion to wind turbines, Robert appears to have few convictions or principles: his skill lies in that old politicians’ trick – telling people what they want to hear. Yet while he is cynical, you can’t help warming to him – and he’s certainly more sympathetic than any of the characters in The Dinner.Yet, inevitably, a serpent steals into paradise. At the city’s new year bash, Robert spots his wife, Sylvia, chatting with an unprepossessing alderman. The alderman says something that makes Sylvia laugh and, for a split-second, his hand rests on her elbow. This is the only prompt that Robert’s imagination needs: he is instantly cast into a world of suspicion. Are Sylvia and the alderman having an affair? On the surface, it seems unlikely, but soon Robert is devoting every waking moment to mentally pursuing this possibility.As an exploration of pathological jealousy, The Ditch is largely convincing. Koch is especially good at inhabiting Robert’s looking-glass world, in which every little thing becomes grounds for suspicion. On a weekend break to Paris, Sylvia affectionately teases her husband. “Would she still tease me (and smile and wink),” he asks, “if she were having an affair with Maarten van Hoogstraten?” But then a darker thought intrudes: is her friendliness merely a “five-star performance”, put on for the express purposes of allaying his suspicion? At a certain point, jealousy becomes almost indistinguishable from comedy in the lengths to which it goes to distort reality.The focus on Robert’s jealousy, however, proves short-lived. Other plotlines come to the fore: the imminent deaths of Robert’s ageing parents a possible scandal from his past. His jealousy, it becomes clear, had a defensive function: it was a means to distract him from more pressing (and real) concerns. Yet this realisation doesn’t particularly help the novel. The various strands never fully cohere, and in an apparent effort to make them do so, Koch makes his characters do implausible things. Nothing in the book’s latter stages proves as compelling as the paranoia it initially explored. The Ditch, you can’t help feeling, would have been more successful had it cleaved more tightly to its opening theme.• The Ditch by Herman Koch (translated by Sam Garrett) is published by Picador (£14.99).

Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. 2018 saw the disappearance of Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld as a result.In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u0026nbspAt the same time, there is a move away from buying ‘stuff’ as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.In the October 2018 budget the government announced\u0026nbspsome relief\u0026nbspon business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a £675m \u0027future high streets\u0027 fund under which local councils can bid for up to £25m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas – which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come – retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the Far East, have also added to costs and hit profits.The planning work is being overseen by Arcadia’s chief executive, Ian Grabiner, according to a report in the Sunday Times. The newspaper said Grabiner had convinced Green that the strategy was better than keeping the group together.Arcadia has already started to untangle shared functions such as IT and HR to help the groundwork for a potential separation, according to the report.The move comes as Green’s empire battles declining sales and profitability amid an increase in competition from online retailers, after years of underinvestment by the former billionaire.Employing about 17,000 with brands that have been household names on the high street for decades, Arcadia managed to stave off collapse in June after winning the backing of its creditors for a rescue plan that involved closing 50 of its 570 stores and 1,000 job losses.Arcadia had faced legal challenges in the US from two property groups battling the outcome of some of its CVAs. However, the landlords Vornado and Caruso agreed deals last week to drop their claims as part of an out-of-court settlement.The Sunday Times said Green had been waiting to resolve the disputes before taking steps towards separation . Carving the company into several parts could help maximise value by enabling the company to stagger the sales process for each of its brands.Any sales process would be watched closely by the Pensions Regulator, which has veto powers over disposals due to a £750m deficit in Arcadia’s retirement scheme.Green, 67, was heavily criticised for his sale of BHS to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt, for just £1 in March 2015. The company collapsed a year later with the loss of 11,000 jobs, leaving a pensions black hole of more than £500m.Green agreed to hand over £363m to the scheme in a deal with the regulator amid a whirlwind of political pressure and calls for the businessman to lose his knighthood.A spokesman for Arcadia declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5934595e9b5026b4cd40aee0957bbdbc66ffee75/0_356_7175_4305/master/7175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7710ad5af4ff2c038fef62573d9ecaab","title":"we want wow factor oxfam to open first charity superstore","story":"Outlet in Oxford industrial park, including on-site cafe, is aimed at turning perceptions on their headOxfam is to open its first superstore on the outskirts of Oxford in an experiment aimed at turning perceptions of charity shopping as outdated on their head.On the edge of a sprawling business park off a ringroad to the south-east of the city, a squad of 20-plus staff and volunteers have been busy sorting through new merchandise and donations to stock the shop in readiness for its opening on 7 September.Inside the entrance of the hangar-style industrial unit, about 12 times the size of the average Oxfam shop, a lengthy wall of display units is filled with products from its eco-friendly Sourced by Oxfam range including Fairtrade chocolate and coffee, bamboo coffee cups and lunchboxes and packs of Christmas cards.Everything else is very different in the vast and airy space, which the charity wants to be more than just a shop. “Our aim is for this to be an enjoyable and fun ‘destination’ shopping experience,” says Oxfam’s trading director, Andrew Horton. “Customers will be able to shop ethically, but we want this new store to have the wow factor. We want people to linger, to chat over coffee. We have a 10-year lease on this unit and if it is successful we will roll it out in other locations.”The space includes the first on-site cafe, which will serve a changing menu of “world foods” as well as tea and coffee. “The cafe will be at the heart of a new community space where we will host free talks and events for school groups, for example,” Horton said. Oxford is, of course, where the charity was founded more than 75 years ago and the first Oxfam shop opened its doors there in 1948. It now has 610 shops in the UK, and a growing online operation, but logistics can be tricky in its shops in towns and city centres, where there is also intense competition among charity shops on the high street. The pilot superstore was inspired by the Swedish children’s charity Erikshjalpen,  which created a larger-format store in an accessible location and not on a conventional retail park.The Oxfam superstore’s neighbours include a Premier Inn and a David Lloyd fitness centre. “We decided that opening on a retail park would be a challenge – coping with typical opening hours of 10am to 8pm was going to be a tough ask in terms of staffing,” Horton said. “This suits us better and we will only open four days a week.”A drive-in donation point at the rear of the shop is intended to make it easier for people to donate larger items and in bulk. Among other new ideas being tested are a “market stall” area with 12 booths for local ethical B Corps, lending libraries for electrical goods and others. Oxfam will also sell secondhand white goods for the first time, with a one-year warranty, through the local company Rework.Oxfam has also emerged as an unlikely rising star on the UK’s fast-growing online fashion scene as it casts an increasingly canny eye over branded cast-offs and vintage styles handed in to its shops every day. There is a large mezzanine area in the new superstore devoted to online sales, where Oxfam will photograph high-value vintage fashion items, sought-after homeware and books and post them on Pinterest and other social media.Oxfam’s operations manager, Emma Joy, says: “We take the view that people who donate want us to try and raise as much money as we can.

Barnardo’s has also given its homeware sections a modern makeover.Amid the high street doom and gloom, UK charity shops have boosted UK retail sales, but Horton says Oxfam’s priority is to boost donations and the size of its volunteer workforce.The national volunteer workforce is currently around 23,000 strong, and he is building a pool of 150 for the new store. Among them is Rosemary Shurgold, a retired health visitor who has volunteered at Oxfam’s Cowley Road shop for 12 years. “I love Oxfam and I absolutely love this new store,” she smiles. “You’d have to pay me to stay away.”• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76ac1bd05bf4f80b984bb128c95721d5672d7965/0_352_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b2e7b6b942ff5f28bd2752ae180e4bd","title":"term starting english schools arts emergency subjects","story":"A new school year is about to begin. This means that I might soon arrive at a school and do a poetry workshop with some younger teenagers. It could well go like this. They make it clear that they don’t like poetry. I tell them poetry comes in hundreds of different shapes, sizes, rhythms and moods one way we can make poems is in a group and without writing anything down. For example, the people who are in charge of us in life have ways of showing they are fed up with us, angry with us, or through which they try to control us punish us, even. What do such people say? I suggest they go into pairs and say these kinds of things to each other – in role, as parents, teachers, carers. We select the best lines. Then I say, can we create this into a scene? They suggest that all the lines should be said to just one of them sitting in a chair the rest stand in a semicircle around him, and as they each say their line they point at the boy in the chair and then step back, while the semicircle repeats a chosen chorus.We have made a snapshot of one aspect of their lives. It has rhythm, structure, solo and chorus, movement and mimesis. Later they can perform it for others, write a transcript of it and “publish” it on a school blog. We can talk about what we have made: what worked? Was it like any other poems or plays?This is the arts in action. There should be a place for it in all schools, but it is becoming desperately difficult to find the time, staffing or resources to make it happen.Why? Because school means choices, and there are competing ideas about what school is for. The position firmly in place now in England, thanks largely to the influence of Michael Gove during his time as education secretary, is that our schools should focus their attention on producing units of sellable labour power (school leavers), and these units should be seen as being more or less able to compete in what ministers call the global labour market there is an agreed amount of knowledge that needs to be transferred from teachers to pupils so that they can become these competitive units. Capacity to compete has to be measured by putting in place tests at key moments throughout a person’s school life so that by the end, school will disgorge a graded set of units – some of whom have this knowledge, and about a third of whom do not.There is another way. The world is becoming increasingly changeable and unpredictable, so why should education make the knowledge being passed on so finite and certain why ide all of it into measurable units? And why ask education to jump to the economic system’s demands and solve its woes? Doesn’t the new world of climate change, automation, fake news and global digital communication make it necessary for young people to be more flexible, interpretive, critical and creative? Why has so much been added to the curriculum, with the consequence that the GCSE course in many schools has lengthened to three years plus much more homework, reducing time for the arts and cutting down on scope for teachers to devise courses and materials away from what’s required in national exams? There should be room in education for schooling to be more responsive to events, more focused on varying interpretations and more able to create artistic and technological responses to the world as it changes. There should be more time both in and outside of lessons for students to follow personal and cultural interests.All this requires the delivery of knowledge – plenty of it – but in ways that ask students to do things with that knowledge rather than to just absorb it. Some of this knowledge may be difficult or even impossible to measure, but so be it. The arts investigate the properties of the world by playing with materials – such as stone, paint, fabric, synthetic substances, the human body, the human voice and of course language. They investigate the mind’s responses to the material world and to other people, past and present, and to how we organise ourselves into societies, institutions and groups. The arts always involve change and transformation. In the process of making something – a dance, a film, a song, a textile design, whatever – we change “stuff” in order to create something new. In changing stuff, we change ourselves.This is fun. It’s absorbing. It’s emotional. It touches us and moves us. It’s social: in doing the arts we find out what we need from each other. But it’s also about survival – surviving as iniduals, as groups, but also as the human race. It may not be a sufficient means to keep barbarism and despoliation of the planet at bay, but I believe it is a necessary condition for this, because the arts keep coming back to the question: what is the “us-ness” of us? It’s about time the arts had a guaranteed place in schools and the way they enhance students’ lives was properly recognised.• Michael Rosen is a writer and broadcaster, and a former children’s laureate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17317bc121791e9f875968656d03cc2545e32880/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23869e4240d0a1f8b871cf612a026aa5","title":"observer guide autumn culture books art films tv theatre classical music dance","story":"Long-awaited albums, audacious political theatre and TV fit to follow Game of Thrones, plus film, dance, classical and more… our critics preview the new seasonYou know Oscar season is approaching when the weather gets chillier and the options at the cinema get a little more literary – and so autumn duly brings two star-laden adaptations of major modern American novels.First comes The Goldfinch on 27 September: Donna Tartt’s epic Pulitzer prize-winner sprawls in a way some pundits thought more suited to a TV miniseries, but building on the Oscar-nominated success of Brooklyn, director John Crowley is tackling it for the big screen, with Ansel Elgort heading the cast as semi-orphaned wanderer Theo Decker, and Nicole Kidman ideally cast as Mrs Barbour.On 30 November, Jonathan Lethem’s celebrated detective odyssey Motherless Brooklyn hits cinemas courtesy of director and star Edward Norton – venturing behind the camera for the first time in 19 years.Both are challenging projects: will they do their source material justice? Meanwhile, you have some catch-up time if you haven’t read either novel – otherwise how can you say “the book was better” with any kind of airy authority? Guy LodgeAny UK tour by Ariana Grande will always be emotional. Fresh off a run of August London dates and a special performance in Manchester for Pride, the singer now takes her huge album of last year, Sweetener, around the rest of the UK she’s recently added a further two London dates at the end of October.Our own Charli XCX, meanwhile, wondered whether she would ever release another album proper. But after five years of innovative mixtapes and arresting standalone singles comes a full-on studio effort – Charli – on 13 September, studded with guests as erse as Christine and the Queens, bedroom pop auteur Clairo and self-styled queen of New Orleans “bounce”, Big Freedia.Charli’s former tour mate, candid US singer Halsey, has hinted – in a mocked-up mugshot in the video for her track Nightmare in May – at an October release date for her own “loud” third album, widely expected to be called Manic. Halsey has described the writing process as one of “learning to forgive myself”. Kitty EmpireSince Game of Thrones slayed the world – let’s forget that damp squib of a final series – the fantasy genre is back in televisual vogue. Screenwriters have been raiding the bookshelves for similar sagas to adapt and the first wave of Westeros-influenced series arrive this autumn.Most promising, though, is the BBC and HBO’s ambitious adaptation of Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy. With a cast led by James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda and, of course, an armoured CGI polar bear, confidence in its success is so high that a second series is already commissioned. George RR who? Michael HoganAfter her triumphs with Enron and The Effect, dramatist Lucy Prebble turns her unswerving gaze on the death of Alexander Litvinenko. Based on the book by the ’s Moscow correspondent Luke Harding, A Very Expensive Poison considers how in 2006 the Russian spy, MI6 informant and Putin critic died of radiation poisoning after drinking a cup of green tea in a central London hotel. The play is at the Old Vic until 5 October: John Crowley directs Tom Brooke and MyAnna Buring play the Litvinenkos, Reece Shearsmith is Putin. Susannah ClappKen Loach brings the same scalding anger to the gig economy in Sorry We Missed You as he did to the benefits system with I, Daniel Blake. And, in Newcastle upon Tyne, the films also share the same location. This portrait of a family strained to breaking point by a treadmill of hard graft and mounting debt is superbly acted and unwavering in its focus. The deliberate pacing and edgy, restless camera give the story a cruel momentum and sense of the walls closing in on a hapless delivery driver who just wants to do well by his kids. Wendy IdeDid Helen really exist? Did the most beautiful woman in the world actually provoke the destruction of one of the greatest cities of all time? And why are there so many different versions of the story, from Homer to Shakespeare to Hollywood? This magnificent show plunges us deep into the myth and the reality, bringing alive the captivating characters of this ancient civilisation through sculptures, paintings, vases and fragments of literature, proving that there was a real Troy, and revealing its fate. From 21 November to 8 March. Laura CummingWe are quite possibly in UK rap’s golden age, and autumn’s live shows epitomise that. Two of this year’s Mercury prize nominees, the powerful Little Simz and raucous Slowthai, are both touring the country, as is one of Afroswing’s finest, MoStack, riding high off his debut LP. Ladbroke Grove star AJ Tracey will be playing Ally Pally, while Charlie Sloth’s infamous Fire in the Booth show will be getting a September live edition with a first-time festival in Sheffield (with the somewhat dubious title of Fire in the Park), featuring the likes of Giggs and Yxng Bane. Grime don Skepta is heading up a phenomenal Warehouse Project line-up in November (rising stars Octavian and Flohio are among others playing that day). Finally, the release of Kano’s Class of Deja has arguably been the biggest grime moment of the year (second only to Stormzy at Glastonbury) – accordingly, Kano’s tour this October is a must, culminating in a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Tara JoshiBen Lerner’s third novel, The Topeka School (3 October), is an education in the sympathetic imagination, a deep and bracing intellectual challenge, a powerful political statement. As usual, Lerner plays winningly in the fertile ground between fiction and memoir, as usual he is often hilarious and occasionally infuriating. Wider-reaching, subtler and kinder than his earlier works, this is a novel to cherish.We return to Gilead in another Booker-longlisted novel, Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments (10 September) which carries powerful messages for the #MeToo generation. It’s striking that this novel is published just before another highly anticipated book, She Said by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Both should be required reading.Zadie Smith’s short stories are predictably luminous, insightful and full of glorious prose. It’s hard to believe that Grand Union (3 October) is her first collection, drawing as it does on more than a decade of writing for the New Yorker. She’s already one of our best novelists and essayists this reminds us that her short stories are right up there too.Jonathan Safran Foer is always fascinating on the subject of vegetarianism – his Eating Animals persuaded me to (almost) give up meat. We Are the Weather (10 October) shows the clear link between industrialised animal farming and climate breakdown in a book of scintillating relevance and authority.In these times of political turbulence and an increasingly rabid and scrofulous commentariat, the sanity, wisdom and clarity of Rebecca Solnit’s writing is a forceful corrective. Whose Story Is This? (5 September) is a scorchingly intelligent collection about the struggle to control narratives in the internet age. Alex PrestonTwo of the UK’s most accomplished satirists, Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci, both launch films this autumn. But the pair, who previously collaborated on the TV series The Day Today, take markedly erging approaches with their respective projects. Morris, who skewered Islamist terrorism in Four Lions, turns his focus on the US law enforcement agencies that manufacture threats in order to justify department funding. The anger in The Day Shall Come is to be expected the stab of poignancy comes as a surprise. Iannucci, meanwhile, has left his habitual political arena (Veep, In the Loop, The Death of Stalin) and adapted Dickens’s David Copperfield. The Personal History of David Copperfield stars Dev Patel in the title role and opens the London film festival. WIMargate expanded as a centre for art with the opening of the Carl Freedman Gallery in the old Thanet Press building, next to Tracey Emin’s studio, in May. Its second exhibition, Gossamer, curated by Zoe Budeaux, brings together 22 artists – including Uday, Louise Bourgeois and Sarah Lucas – who work with tights or stockings, and will open on 28 September. Also from 28 September, actor and art collector Russell Tovey curates Margate NOW, a town-wide festival of music, art and drama, including events in unexpected places from the railway station to the shore. And all of this accompanies the opening of the Turner prize show at Turner Margate (28 September) with one of the strongest shortlists in many years, bringing together Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Tai Shani and Oscar Murillo. LCAnticipation around Martin Scorsese’s plan to dramatise the real-life story of mob hitman Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, who was involved in the notorious disappearance of labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975, has been cranking up for years. Now it’s finally hitting cinemas on 8 November, with Robert De Niro as Sheeran and Al Pacino as Hoffa – but with only a brief window before it streams on Netflix on 27 November. This is familiar ground for Scorsese but the pedigree is high: Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List) wrote the script and Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin co-star. Killian FoxBritish ballet promises some intriguing major debuts by dancers. The Royal Ballet’s Marcelino Sambé marks his recent promotion to principal dancer by reprising his raffish Lescaut for Kenneth MacMillan’s Manon, opening at Covent Garden in October, before taking a lead role as Franz in Coppélia on 28 December. Expect buoyant technique and giddy charisma from this young ace.Northern Ballet’s Antoinette Brooks-Daw is moving into the company’s top rank following rich turns in Cathy Marston’s Jane Eyre and Victoria. Catch her displaying her narrative chops in Morgann Runacre-Temple’s Kingdom of Back – part of a new mixed bill along with David Nixon’s Dracula (Leeds, Doncaster and Canterbury, SeptemberOctober).And then there’s former Washington Ballet star Brooklyn Mack who joins English National Ballet as a guest artist. Fresh from a well-received stint at American Ballet Theatre, he has roles in Christopher Wheeldon’s Cinderella (Manchester, Southampton, October) and Anna‑Marie Holmes’s Le Corsaire (Milton Keynes, November). Sara VealeTwo starkly different views of the capital arrive on the streaming service this autumn. In a period of flux for the real royal family, it seems timely for sumptuous biopic The Crown to return with a fresh cast. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as the Queen, with Tobias Menzies as Prince Phillip and, deliciously, Helen Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret. Covering the period from 1964 to 1976, it glides majestically on to Netflix on 17 November.The other comeback is more surprising but entirely welcome. Top Boy, writer Ronan Bennett’s down-and-dirty thriller about Hackney drug gangs, was bafflingly axed by Channel 4 six years ago. Now it’s been revived on Netflix with the backing of Canadian superstar Drake. The reboot, which drops on 13 September, sees Dushane (Ashley Walters) and Sully (Kane “Kano” Robinson) return from exile to reclaim their territory, only to find an ambitious new generation are now running things. Rappers Little Simz and Dave join the cast, alongside exciting new discovery Micheal Ward. (See feature on page 20.) MHAway from the superhero glut of summer, autumn has become the new season for more grown-up sci-fi escapism: recently Interstellar, Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 all opted for the cooler months. The biggest-budget project yet from American auteur James Gray (revered in France, underrated everywhere else), Ad Astra stars Brad Pitt as an astronaut venturing deep into the solar system in search of his father it premieres in competition at the Venice film festival and opens shortly after, on 18 September.Unpredictable as ever, two-time Oscar-winner Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain, Life of Pi) returns with Gemini Man (in cinemas 11 October), a high-concept, hi-tech thriller with Will Smith as a hitman pursuing his younger self – it sounds a bit derivative of Rian Johnson’s Looper, but in Lee we trust.If Hollywood fantasy doesn’t do it for you, seek out Aniara (out now, reviewed page 32), a fascinating, meditative Swedish mission to Mars. In this version of space, no one can hear you scream, but at least you can hear yourself think. GLA decade on since landfill indie seemed to consign guitar music to the dustbin of history, a new wave of innovative, boundary-pushing releases is on its way to expand the genre’s horizons. Erstwhile Sexwitch vocalist Bat for Lashes embraces a dreamy 80s vibe on her forthcoming album Lost Girls (AWAL, 6 September): saxophone solos, arpeggiated synths and lyrics about female vampire biker gangs feature.Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard releases her debut solo album, Jaime (Columbia, 20 September). Dedicated to her sister, who died of cancer when they were teens, it has a tender, expansive sound, encompassing soulful ruminations on love, spirituality, and growing up as a mixed-race child in the deep south.Angel Olsen follows up 2016’s excellent My Woman with the magisterial yet delicate All Mirrors (Jagjaguwar, 4 October), preceded by a mesmerising new single of the same name with a cinematic black-and-white video.Finally, Michael Kiwanuka’s meditative, assured third album Kiwanuka (Polydor, 25 October) s psych-gospel, politics and self-acceptance, as well as nodding to his Ugandan heritage. Kathryn BromwichTate Britain is gathering new momentum this year, after the success of Van Gogh and Britain and Mike Nelson’s elegiac Duveen Commission. Huge crowds are anticipated for its autumn exhibitions. These include William Blake, from 11 September, which doesn’t focus on one particular area so much as the all-embracing originality of his vision, entering his mind through the works, and recreating the tiny room where they were made. Two Turner prizewinners follow: Mark Leckey (from 24 September) builds a life-size replica of a motorway bridge on the Wirral, where he grew up, as the scene for new video and audio works. And Steve McQueen brings his mass portrait of 70,000 primary school children to the museum: the nation’s future, from 12 November. LCWritten for the Venice carnival season, Handel’s early-career gem Agrippina, about one woman’s lust for power, and rivalry in love, is staged for the Royal Opera House by the director of the moment, Barrie Kosky, with a glittering lineup led by American mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, British countertenor Iestyn Davies and British soprano Lucy Crowe. Packed with explosive music and showpiece arias, this is a story for our times, of leadership and failed diplomacy. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and cast are conducted by the Handel specialist and harpsichordist Maxim Emelyanychev. Fiona MaddocksNot one, not two, but four short new works by our greatest living dramatist have landed, fully formed, in the Royal Court’s lap, and are being staged in one quadruple bill. Which is basically Christmas come early for theatre fans. As usual with the publicity-averse Churchill, there’s not much known about them yet, but Glass is reportedly about a girl made of glass, Kill deals with gods and murderers, Bluebeard tackles a serial killer’s friends, and Imp concerns a secret in a bottle. James Macdonald, with whom Churchill worked on Escaped Alone, directs the lot for a limited three-week run (18 September to 12 October). Holly WilliamsOn his 2017 album Peasant, Richard Dawson harked back to early medieval England to chronicle a nation at war with itself. No need for distant historical allegories on his latest record 2020 (Weird World, 11 October), which is less a snapshot of contemporary Britain than a full-scale narrative immersion. The Newcastle folk-rocker, whose interests extend to Sufi devotional music and beyond, tells first-person stories of ordinary Englanders trapped in an increasingly cruel system, which sucks their souls dry for profit. Listening to civil servants unravelling at the thought of depriving yet another poor soul of their disability living allowance may sound like hard going, but 2020 is funny, freaky and unexpectedly melodic as well as desperately moving – you won’t hear a better song about the hell of working in Amazon-style distribution warehouses than Dawson’s 10-minute Fulfilment Centre. KFIt’s farewell to Sarah Frankcom, who’s been a brilliant head of the Manchester Royal Exchange – but she should go out with a bang with Light Falls (from 24 October). A new play by Simon Stephens is always an event, but even more exciting is the man doing the music: one Jarvis Cocker. Light Falls connects five relatives living in cities across the north, and looks at how they’re drawn together after a devastating event. More cheerful, perhaps, will be The Boy in the Dress – the RSC’s new musical version of David Walliams’s children’s book, with songs by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. The story of Dennis, a 12-year-old who likes football and dresses, is adapted by Mark Ravenhill, and opens 8 November. HWENO’s ambitious season explores the Orpheus myth – the grief-stricken hero tries to rescue his lover from the Underworld – with four operas from the 18th century to the present. Directed by the choreographer Wayne McGregor in his ENO directorial debut, Gluck’s Orpheus and Eurydice stars Alice Coote and Sarah Tynan Harry Bicket conducts. Offenbach’s comic Orpheus in the Underworld is one long, naughty, can-can dancing party. Ed Lyon and Mary Bevan head the cast. Sian Edwards conducts, Emma Rice directs. The unmissable rarities are Harrison Birtwistle’s ritualistic masterpiece The Mask of Orpheus, director Daniel Kramer, conductor Martyn Brabbins and Philip Glass’s Orphée, inspired by Cocteau director Netia Jones, conductor Geoffrey Paterson. Discounts if you book the series. FMYou might think we’ve no shortage of Ibsen – but two new productions look to be bold, essential reimaginings. Hedda Tesman is by Cordelia Lynn (whose Three Sisters has recently been at the Almeida), and promises to breathe new life into Ibsen’s classic, Hedda Gabler, for touring company Headlong. Haydn Gwynne stars in the title role (Chichester Festival theatre, 30 August-28 September the Lowry, Salford 3-19 October). A new version of A Doll’s House, written by Tanika Gupta – who moves the action to Calcutta and invites us to look at the play’s gender politics through the lens of British colonialism – opens at the Lyric Hammersmith on 6 September. It’s the first production by the west London theatre’s new artistic director, Rachel O’Riordan, and stars the captivating Anjana Vasan. HWGentlemen, start your engines because Mama Ru is strutting, sashaying and shantaying our way. After becoming a global phenomenon over the past decade, the long-awaited UK edition of RuPaul’s Drag Race launches on BBC Three in October, with 10 home-grown acts competing to be crowned “the Queen of Great Britain”. Guest judges include Graham Norton, Maisie Williams, Cheryl, Alan Carr, Stacey Dooley, Andrew Garfield, Michaela Coel, Lorraine Kelly and Twiggy, alongside stalwart Michelle Visage. Self-empowering positivity and upbeat bubblegum camp have rarely been more needed. They better werk. MHLondon’s annual Open House weekend (21-22 September) always delivers an embarrassment of architectural riches, providing free access to more than 800 buildings usually off limits to the public, accompanied by a programme of tours and talks. Where else can you take in Lambeth Palace and the Marx Memorial Library in a single weekend? Marking the centenary of the Addison Act, which made “housing for all” a government policy, some of London’s key postwar housing schemes will also open their doors for the first time. They include Alexandra Road in Camden, the Golden Lane Estate and Ernö Goldfinger’s twin monuments to brutalism, Trellick Tower and Balfron Tower. Other London landmarks, such as the BT Tower and 10 Downing Street, will be available to visit by online ballot. Catherine SlessorBranden Jacob-Jenkins – who has had hits here with An Octoroon and Gloria – brings his 2014 play Appropriate to the Donmar until 5 October (see review, page 40). The Lafayette family return to their late father’s house, a former plantation in Arkansas – and this, being a Jacob-Jenkins play, is a slanted, subversive take on the classic American family drama. It’s directed by Ola Ince (The Convert), and stars Monica Dolan.There’s more family feuding in Fairview – which won Jackie Sibblies Drury this year’s Pulitzer prize for drama, and which promises to rip the genre to shreds. At London’s Young Vic from 28 November, directed by Nadia Latif, this race drama should provoke, unsettle and dazzle audiences here too. Annie Baker is back at the National Theatre – which staged her hugely acclaimed plays John and The Flick – with The Antipodes, in which people sit around a table, telling, examining, and categorising stories. Intriguingly, Baker herself co-directs with Chloe Lamford, who is also designing the show (21 October-23 November).

Since 2000, in fact, when he and Matthew Holness created spoof horror author Garth Marenghi, who’d transition from Edinburgh stage to Channel 4 show (all the while penning books like Afterbirth, in which a mutated placenta attacks Bristol, and Black Fang, which asks the question: what if a rat could drive a bus?)Ever since, Ayoade has appeared in everything from The Mighty Boosh (as the belligerent shaman Saboo) to Danger Mouse (an evil snowman). He has presented every TV show, from the rebooted The Crystal Maze to his celebrity adventures on Travel Man. He has also directed everything from music videos (for bands like Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) to feature films (his 2011 debut Submarine and a film of Dostoevsky’s The Double in 2014). And now the pinnacle of his career: joining us for a webchat on Thursday 5 September at 12pm BST.His latest project is a book called Ayoade On Top, a sort-of-memoir-cum-ode to the film Gwyneth Paltrow once called the worst she’s ever been in: View From the Top, in which Ayoade argues for the canonisation of “this brutal masterpiece”.

The move is one of several government measures intended to bolster education standards.The new, expanded inspection programme aims to ensure that parents get up-to-date information and can be confident that schools rated outstanding continue to provide the highest standards, said Williamson. “Every parent wants to know their child is getting a great education and I will leave no stone unturned in my drive to deliver that,” he said.Since 2012, once rated outstanding, schools have been exempt from routine inspections to free them from external intervention. But many schools need up-to-date comparative performance information and parents deserve greater assurance that the education provided remains of the highest quality, Williamson has decided. His department will consult on how best to do this, subject to parliamentary approval, and bring these schools back into a regular inspection cycle.A new specialist academy trust will also be set up to take on schools struggling with long-term under-performance. The scheme is to be piloted in northern England.Sunday’s announcement comes days after the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged a £14bn boost for education and outlined ambitions to close the gap in standards across the country. The funding package includes £2.6bn for 2020-21, £4.8bn for 2021-22, and £7.1bn for 2022-23.

It was an unusual sight. Salmon are rarely found in the Afan these days.The scene may have been unexpected, but it nevertheless illustrates a growing problem, say researchers – one that already affects rivers across Europe and could pose even greater threats to habitats and wildlife in future. Increasing numbers of dams, weirs, sluices and other barriers built in rivers over the past 200 years are, they say, fragmenting waterways, isolating habitats and weakening wildlife populations.The salmon on the Afan provides a good example, according to Peter Jones, a postdoctoral researcher at Swansea University. “It was lying on gravel in front of a weir. It would have been trying to get upriver, and although there are fish steps at the side of the weir it would still have had its progress slowed, and been left vulnerable to predators such as otters. The gulls are probably just having an opportunistic snack.”Jones is a member of a Swansea-led project called Amber (Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers), which aims to find ways to halt the fragmentation of European rivers and the dangerous isolation of their habitats. “Flowing rivers are healthy rivers – and by flowing we don’t mean just water, we mean sediment, energy, nutrients and organisms,” said the project leader, Professor Carlos Garcia de Leaniz.The trouble is that very few rivers today have flowing, healthy waters. Apart from abstraction by water companies and farmers, which lowers river levels, more and more barriers are being revealed by the Amber project, which is funded by the EU.“In Europe we have detected 460,000 barriers, and by the end of the year we estimate that we’ll have 600,000,” said de Leaniz, director of Swansea’s Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Research. These dams and weirs pepper Europe’s rivers and prevent migratory fish from swimming upstream to reach their spawning grounds in river headwaters. They also stop vital nutrients flowing downstream to the sea, to the detriment of coastal marine ecosystems.Amber is intended to provide a European overview of the problem. In addition, a second, very detailed survey – called Reconnecting Our River – has been established to study the nearby River Afan. The lessons learned here could be applied to other UK rivers.“Technically the Afan is considered a free-flowing river because there are no big dams on it,” said Josh Jones, another researcher with the Swansea team. “In fact, our work shows there are about 600 barriers inside its catchment area, including weirs, culverts, pipes, channels and sluices.“In many cases, no one can remember why these were built. But each one contributes in some way to the fragmenting of the river environment.”It is also thought that the dams, weirs and culverts built on the Afan over the centuries may be playing a part in slowing its restoration as a salmon and trout river.In the 19th century coalmine waste and other industrial pollutants killed most fish in the Afan it was not until the middle of the 20th century that its waters were cleaned and restored.However, salmon and trout have been slow to return and the researchers point to the hundreds of barriers that have been placed across the Afan and may well be delaying the restoration of fish stocks in the river.Scientists also warn that, as the climate crisis increases its grip on the planet, river fragmentation will become an even greater problem. Pools of still water created by dams and barriers will become vulnerable to rising temperatures, for example. “That risks triggering major changes in wildlife,” added Richard O’Rorke, another Swansea researcher.The crucial point is that river barriers will need to be removed – which is likely to be costly. A major aim of Amber, and also of the Reconnecting Our River project, is to highlight ways of alleviating problems of river flow without spending vast sums.“It may be that, instead of knocking down a large dam to improve water quality in a river, we can interfere with smaller structures and make less expensive changes that will still bring significant improvements,” said O’Rorke. “That is a specific goal of this research.”All major rivers in Europe are now disconnected from the sea, and this has had a catastrophic impact on many species, according to campaigning organisation Amber.• Salmon and eel have become extinct or are threatened with extinction in many UK rivers, and the presence of dams and weirs is partly to blame.• In the Netherlands and Germany, barriers along the River Rhine prevent the migration of sturgeon and shad.• In Spain and Portugal, salmon have disappeared from all but a handful of rivers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

He’s excited about the new collection. The first pieces went into John Lewis’s White City store that morning and he is visibly chuffed. He’s already wearing the trouser samples, which will go on sale in November, and it looks like he’ll be living in them for a while. He’s his own best customer. “I personally like a dishevelled, worn garment,” he says. “I like that patina things take on when they look well-worn.”The tagline for the collection made exclusively for sale in John Lewis and Folk, is “Wear it out”. “It’s not fast fashion,” he says. “It’s important that people wear the garments out.” Folk already repairs clothes that are returned if they have been damaged. “If they can be repaired or upcycled, then the team will make sure that happens,” he says. The same will be true for It’s All Good Folk. “If something needs a minor repair we will replace the garment, if need be, then we can repair it and resell it, or we can make a charitable donation so it can be used and worn again.”Making clothes last longer is important, but it is only part of the story. Fashion has become an industry that even the people who work in it feel increasingly uneasy about. Designers and supply-chain managers like those in McAteer’s team are all too aware of news about microplastic-contaminated rain in remote parts of the world, about fashion brands burning clothes they can’t sell, and the unfathomable amounts of waste and pollution created by the production of fashion and textiles.McAteer’s team are keen to drive change within the business. When John Lewis approached Folk to collaborate on a menswear line, it made sense to do things a little differently and rethink the way the collection is sourced and made. He employed the services of sustainability consultant Dan Holmes. “We have been studying how we can make our supply chain, suppliers and ourselves do things better,” said McAteer. The result has motivated the team and re-energised the whole business.A lot of it made both common and business sense, like making sure factories were close to fabric suppliers so they were no longer shipping a material from, say, Japan to Poland, to cut down on air miles. “It’s always a balance,” says Holmes. “Is a recycled fibre better than organic? Is organic better than BCI – which is Better Cotton Initiative? It’s all about trade-offs. Is the focus on ocean plastic or climate change?” These are the questions all brands – big or small – should be asking. But there are no easy answers or quick fixes. “There are definitely people doing it much better,” says McAteer. This is a starting point. The whole team is really excited about the fabrics we’ve chosen to use, from BCI cottons to the organic cottons, recycled nylons, polyesters. It is definitely positive and we are pretty happy.”Rethinking materials and sourcing is all very well, but it still doesn’t address the issue that we are fundamentally making too many clothes. That’s why McAteer is so determined to communicate the “wear it out” message to ensure that nothing ends up being worn a few times before ending up in landfill.He shows me the video he made to promote the new collection and its underlying message. It was filmed in Glasgow, inspired by the early days of Folk, when he and a couple of friends would go on a road trip and take pictures. It perfectly encapsulates the Folk spirit – utilitarian clothes to have a good time in. It’s the details that are all important: the seams designed to flatter the lines of the body, the subtle logo printed on the side of a jacket, the fit that allows you to move.Cathal McAteer grew up in Cumbernauld, outside Glasgow, in the 1980s, with little interest in school and an obsession with clothes and design. He got himself a milk round at 12 so that he could save up money to buy cool stuff he was into, and, by the time he was 16, he was working in Glasgow’s cult designer boutique, Ichi Ni San.In 1990, Glasgow was the City of Culture (the Independent dubbed it “City of Couture”) and was enjoying its moment in the style spotlight with a thriving music and fashion scene. McAteer was at its epicentre, modelling for the store and soon travelling to the shows in London and Paris, in search of new collections to sell. Already, he was dreaming of his own shop and label.He moved to London in the late 1990s and, after a few years working for brands including Nicole Farhi, he was convinced there was a niche for a new label for people like him and his friends. In 2001, Folk was born. The name was suggested by a friend – the perfect unassuming tag for a quietly cool Modern British brand that was to gain a following of people in the know, tuned into the worlds of music, art and design, as well as the finer details of utility tailoring.Eighteen years on, Folk has grown a loyal and dedicated following. Womenswear was introduced in 2012 along with accessories, shoes and the odd bit of furniture and a selection of other products that have caught McAteer’s eye and share his values. There are now five stores and regular collaborations with artists, designers and musicians.The collaboration with John Lewis meant McAteer had to make sure his manufacturers were signed up to the partnership’s Responsible Sourcing Code of Practice that sets out expectations on pay, working hours, child labour, worker rights and the right to freedom of association as well as responsible sourcing of materials, with factories being audited by third-party companies. It meant asking some of his suppliers who weren’t already on the list to sign up, which he says is due diligence and good for them, too.While you could argue that if Folk is serious about reducing its impact, it wouldn’t be expanding with a new collection in 12 John Lewis stores, but fashion is a business and McAteer wants to grow in a measured way. The irony is, the brand now has a greater access to more sustainably sourced materials which were previously too expensive for him to buy in smaller quantities.McAteer doesn’t believe people should pay more just because a product is made in a more sustainable way. That, surely, should be standard. Through economies of scale, It’s All Good Folk is cheaper than the main Folk line. A print shirt is £75, while a T-shirt made from Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS)-certified organic cotton is £40.As he zips up his minimalist twist on a classic MA1 jacket, which is made of recycled polyester, he talks me through the collection. All the pieces are based on archive favourites, redesigned for today – which means not just the fabrications but the styling, too. There’s a shirt that was originally made in cotton but has been reimagined in a new low impact viscose called EcoVera. The original version felt stiffer, this one has a lovely drapey feel to it.“It’s all Good Folk is designed with the Folk ethos at heart – that’s unrestrictive clothes designed beautifully with every detail marked off,” says McAteer. “And then we apply this new ethos in that we make these garments in the best possible way, with a trusted manufacturer, using fabrics that are locally sourced next to the manufacturer in great factories. And we will make those garments as clean as possible. We will be scrutinised. But let’s do the best we can… we’re asking all the questions.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Lloris then dawdles on the ball with Arsenal’s attacking coming for him and eventually plays a weak pass out to Vertonghen which is intercepted by Aubameyang but luckily makes it straight back to the goalkeeper. Here we go again!Ben Melb emails: “I agree with Sandile. Tottenham have become very dirty. I think it stems from Deli Ali with his fake bravado and aggression but mostly acts as a bullycoward. Similar to Ashley young, who’s done it for years, and displayed the same thing during the stoppage time injury yesterday.”Maybe they are just copying Manchester City’s style of cynical fouls to end attacks. Cunning like foxes. Abhijato Sensarma asks: “Will Ozil ever start for Arsenal again?”Jeremy Dresner emails: “Arsenal look a different team to previous incarnations. With Luiz pinging the ball over top, the Arsenal midfield becomes a bypassed sideshow. Guendouzi especially is sideshow’s sideshow if you will. Luiz is leaving space as he marauds and it shows for his side as spurs exploit the space.”As any fan of cliches will tell you ... there’s no better time to score than just before half-time if you’re trying to get back into a game. It should give Arsenal momentum going into the second period.Jonathan offers: “Good God xhaka lucky to stay on the pitch never mind concede a penalty. It sums up the last ten fifteen minutes though..spurs so much quicker in thought and action, arsenal leaden footed.”Mary says: “It must be so frustrating to root for the gunners. It’s must be like dating a Pulitzer Prize author whose also a Vogue model. Then you find out she is also a heroin addict.”Sandile gives his view: “It’s been a part of their play under Pochettino for a while but Spurs have become a cynical, dirty team haven’t they? They roughed up Ajax in the Champions League last season.”Arsenal have had more of the ball but Spurs have looked more incisive. Luckily, the hosts have reduced the arrears and we should be in for a cracking second half.Lacazette fires a free-kick from 20 yards, forcing Lloris into a fine save which goes straight to Rose who seems to handball it. Calls for a penalty go round the stands as Spurs fail to clear the ball and it ends up back in the box with Lacazette, who takes two great touches and then smashes a shot beyond Lloris from close range.45 mins: Sissoko brings down Aubameyang on the edge of the box for his own amusement. 44 mins: Lloris has had nothing to do for almost 45 minutes, but he proves he is alert as Maitland-Niles flicks the ball into Pepe, who carves out a low drive from 12 yards but Lloris is equal to it and, more importantly, holds on. Stephen Carr (possibly that one) says: “If Arsenal are going to get anything out of this game, they are going to have to display more passivity and stupidity.”42 mins: In hindsight, Xhaka was only a second or two late on that challenge. Just a shame it was around the knee. What can Arsenal do to turn this around? Ceballos should be on soon and possibly Ozil, too.If you like your challenges to be stupid, then Xhaka is your man. He es and, ultimately, through Son in the box to give away the penalty. Kane steps up and sends the goalkeeper the wrong way. Xhaka is so stupid there. 38 mins: Eriksen lines up a free-kick from 30 yards out. The Dane lifts the ball over the wall and Leno shows his better side with a sprawling e to the right and he claws it out.36 mins: Another poor piece of goalkeeping from Leno almost gifts a second to Spurs. Kane hits a weak effort from 20 yards which Leno palms away needlessly, allowing Son to put the ball back into the danger area but Kane can’t get his shot away and danger is averted. 34 mins: Aubameyang is released down the right and lofts a cross into the box for Pepe to attack but Spurs have enough men back to clear it away. Lacazette tries to be decisive but instead just whacks a ball down the pitch and out of play.Nick emails: “Be it not I to bandy accusations about, But how big a fan of Arsenal are you? Your commentary smacks at bias… I bet you loved typing Arsenal fans’ original chant?” Man City, mate.32 mins: Arsenal have dominated possession but Lloris has maintained an untroubled afternoon. More incisive play is needed.30 mins: Pepe swings in a free-kick from the right it’s a dangerous cross but Spurs have plenty of men in the box and Kane is the man to flick it for a corner. Pepe’s corner is headed behind again, this time by Alderweireld while facing the wrong way. Referee Atkinson has spotted an issue involving Danny Rose and gives him a talking to. It wouldn’t be a good time to get sent off.28 mins: Lacazette is brought down 30 yards from goal. Pepe and Luiz line up the opportunity. Who will pull rank? It’s Pepe who gets the free-kick round the wall but it goes well wide. Not a great effort. The first booking of the game goes to Rose after a laughable short goal-kick puts Spurs under pressure, the left-back loses the ball and he cleans out Lacazette. 26 mins: Arsenal getting more of the ball but the midfield three aren’t the best at using it. We might need to see Ceballos sooner than anticipated. 24 mins: Aubameyang gets the better of Sanchez on the left, clips a cross to the back post where Pepe is waiting but his header is blocked by a jumping Rose. The corner is cleared to the edge of the area from where Torreira pokes it wide.Arsenal should just focus on attacking down the left flank if I am being honest as Sanchez looks out of his depth.22 mins: Arsenal fans sing “stand up if you hate Tottenham”. A distinct lack of originality from the home faithful. 20 mins: Spurs know they can get at this defence. Luiz and Sokratis look a long way from the perfect pairing and can be dragged around. Guendouzi goes down under a challenge from Sanchez, who catches the midfielder late late on the heel. 18 mins: WHAT A SAVE! Spurs counter once more as a cross is cleared up to Son on the halfway. The South Korean bides his time as he dribbles towards the box, before cut inside and curling a shot towards the top corner but Leno reads it and palms the ball over. 16 mins: Arsenal must be playing three defensive midfielders due to the fact their defence is so ropey. Luiz and Sokratis both got caught out in the counter for the goal. The knock-on effect of the goal is that Eriksen is looking more confident, proved by him whipping in a shot from 25 yards which Leno pats down. 14 mins: Kolasinac breaks into the box and looks set to steer a perfect cross into the box but the full-back stumbles and his cross is pretty pathetic and the danger is removed. “That is the risk you take when David Luiz is protecting your back door,” Mary Waltz points out.12 mins: For a fans of narrative, Eriksen scoring for Spurs while all these rumours about his future abound, it’s pretty exciting news. Arsenal are done on the counter-attack as Kane wins a flick-on, Son darts for the box, before slipping in Lamela who shoots, Leno palms it out but straight into the path of the onrushing Eriksen. A sucker punch.8 mins: Sanchez plays the ball into Kane’s feet with his back to goal, the striker tries to spin his man but falls over in the process. Kane will need a bit more support if he’s to have an influence here. 6 mins: A corner is whipped into the box by Arsenal and the ball makes it way to Maitland-Niles on the edge of the box. The full-back drives a shot at goal but Kane is in the right place to block the effort.Jonathan Baker is thinking similar to the rest of us: “Going to be a long afternoon at right back for Sanchez by the looks of his first three interventions I’d say.”4 mins: There’s an intensity to Arsenal’s play in the opening stages, while Spurs are struggling to get hold of the ball. Kane smashes a long ball down the pitch for Son to chase but it bounces through to Leno. 2 mins: It’s a lively at the Emirates, which can’t always be said of the Arsenal stadium. Aubameyang gets the home fans going with a backheeled through ball to Kolasinac, who crosses to Pepe, only for the summer signing to thwack the ball over from the edge of the area.Peep! Peep! Peep! Let’s get ready to rumble!Mourinho “believes in everything” when it comes to the result today. Bold prediction. Sky has treated us to another montage, so we must be close to kick-off. Davinson Sanchez at right back is an odd choice in a big game such as this. He has never played there, as far as I am aware, and has never struck me as someone who good do a job in such a position. Let’s all hope he proves me wrong, so that I can eat some humble pie at the end. Serge Aurier cannot be feeling good about himself. You have to say, that hair is magnificent ...Mourinho says he spent some time watching Lille after leaving United to give him something to do. It’s not exactly driving to Dundee in your bare feet. Mourinho points out that Pepe is good at football. Pochettino says Eriksen is in the right frame of mind to play and that it is almost impossible that the Dane will leave the club tomorrow. Emery is asked a very simple question and gives a very complicated answer, which ends with him saying he feels the team can play well. Some stats so I don’t have to bother ...Everton have just won 3-2 against Wolves in a cracking match. The result sees the Toffees move above Arsenal but three points for the Gunners will get them up to third, which would be a cracking place to be going into the international break.Ozil is on the bench for Arsenal and Emery is really keen to keep and utilise the German playmaker, who has endured a tricky summer. After careful analysis of the Spurs lineup, it looks like it could be a 3-4-3, with Rose and Sissoko on the flanks, a front three of Lamela, Kane and Son. It should make it ruddy exciting. Spurs are a little bit different, according to their manager ...Torreira, Xhaka and Guendouzi is a pretty solid base for a midfield, so it should permit plenty of freedom to Pepe et al in the final third to really do what they want. I am yet to see much of Pepe in an Arsenal shirt, so I am fascinated to see how he copes with a derby. I feel he might thrive on it.Anyway ... here’s the incomparable Nick Ames on Unai Emery finding his rhythm. So ... we have the lineups. Arsenal do go with the exciting front three and Ozil makes the bench. For Spurs it is a return to the back three, with Vertonghen coming in. I am not particularly sure how the midfield will look, seeing as they have plenty of attacking players included Lamela, Eriksen, Sissoko and Son all start, so it should be fun to see how that fits together.Here we are the game which will supposedly define seasons or some other nonsense like that. Arsenal need to prove they can be consistently competent in the Premier League, while Spurs will to show they are better than a team that gets beat by Newcastle at home.Will Arsenal show their teeth with an attacking front three of Aubameyang, Lacazette and Pepe? It would be a wonderful show of intent against a Spurs defence which is still trying to settle this season. They could even come up against Vertonghen who has been out of favour so far but could return due to the underwhelming efforts of the other centre-backs.For Spurs, it is all about whether Eriksen is brought into the starting lineup as they really require someone who can create chances and he is certainly a man who can do that. However, due to the impending closure of the European transfer window, the Dane’s desire to leave and few players of his quality being available, it could be a case that he is left out once again.It should be pretty enjoyable either way, as it’s a lovely day for football in north London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa3ce497e1f1def546d276258d9b8e1fac795f4/141_239_3111_1867/master/3111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89b1b20cb09b4b510d5a196c2ad7053a","title":"everton v wolves premier league live","story":"Richarlison scores twice as Everton get the better of Wolves in a five-goal thriller at GoodisonAnd that’s it from me. Thanks for your emails and tweets – I’ll leave you with a nudge in this direction:Everton go fifth. Wolves remain winless. Second season syndrome? Europa League concerns? They are clearly a good side but will hope to find Chelsea’s defence as accommodating as it recently has been when they next walk out at Molineux. This little slump needs nipping in the bud.It definitely is now! That’s it – and a well deserved win for Everton, I’d say. They controlled that second half despite Jimenez’s equaliser.It’s a second yellow for Boly to compound Wolves’ afternoon. He charges Richarlison as the forward makes for the right corner flag and there can be no complaints. Nuno strokes his chin. He knows the game is up now.90+4 min: Neto is booked for a foul on Richarlison and Everton are almost home ...90+3 min: Everton win a left-sided corner and that will suit them just fine. Mina goes up, hoping for a cross. He doesn’t get it. Everton work the ball back towards halfway and then dribble it back towards the other flank.90+1 min: We will see five added minutes here. Can Wolves pull it out of the fire for a third time? They have form for stoppage-time goals ... ask Burnley.89 min: A deep free-kick from Moutinho is headed out and then fed back in towards nobody by Traore. That’s been a big disappointment in this half for Wolves – the fact that we haven’t seen Traore at all.86 min: Another fine save from Patricio now as Sigurdsson’s corner is headed down by Mina. It’s one-handed, again, and probably his best of the afternoon. He is keeping them in this.84 min: That’s dealt with and Everton try to spring a counter. It’s wild and open out there now, once again. Wolves make a final change, Neves coming off and Pedro Neto on.83 min: Another Bennett long throw. Can lightning strike twice? Nope, but a corner will result ...82 min: So close to a hat-trick for Richarlison, who looks full of fun now. He chops inside from the right before aiming for the far corner and seeing Patricio save one-handed!They’re ahead for a third time and it comes from a *magnificent* ball in from Digne. He runs down the left but seems to have run out of angles to put a good ball in. But he whips across an absolutely tantalising delivery from near the corner flag that arcs perfectly for Richarlison, steaming in, to leap above a static Boly and head superbly into the bottom corner!77 min: Calvert-Lewin and Bernard immediately replace Iwobi and Kean. Jimenez needs treatment after taking such a whack in equalising, but is passed fit to carry on.Out of the blue! Wolves’ long throws had come to very little all game, but this time Bennett puts one in from the left and Boly wins the flick-on. Jimenez rushes in bravely at the far post and heads past Pickford despite taking a boot in the face from Digne! It’s 2-2, just when Wolves weren’t really looking likely.72 min: Digne fires an effort over via a deflection and Everton, still looking stronger here, have a corner. Mina brings it down and shoots, leading to the latest penalty claim as it pops off Bennett’s knee and onto his hand at point-blank range. You can’t give those. Although these days you sometimes do.70 min: Kean loses a boot as he tries to get down the right and beat Boly but wins a free-kick in so doing. He’s now found the snazzy pink boot all is well.68 min: Jota is good enough to give the away side a shot in the arm though. He comes on for Cutrone.67 min: Neves is very lucky not to get a fifth booking for Wolves after going in from behind heavily on Sigurdsson. Everton are just that bit quicker to everything at this point. Europa League fatigue?65 min: It’s not been a sparkling second half so far but Everton have been the better side in it and Wolves, really, have not yet looked remotely like equalising. They need to perk up.63 min: A yellow for Delph, now, after a late lunge on Jimenez, who has been quiet in this half.61 min: Sigurdsson’s latest delicious delivery is headed well over by the leaping Kean, who has made an all-action start to the half.59 min: Bennett is booked – Wolves’s fourth yellow card – for a tug on Digne. Saiss is, meanwhile, replaced by Moutinho.57 min: Kean makes determined ground into the box, skinning Coady in doing so, but Bennett and Boly are both across quickly to prevent him getting a shot off.56 min: Iwobi and Kean almost combine well but this is a slightly scruffy phase of midfield play at the moment.53 min: Now a Wolves corner as we continue to rattle along pleasantly enough. Everton defend it well, as they have most of Wolves’ set pieces so far.52 min: Everton scream for a penalty as Coleman claims to have been tugged back by Saiss when running onto a nice clip from Sigurdsson. There did seem to be a faint touch by the Wolves man but there’s no VAR check and no spot kick.50 min: Another Bennett long throw for Wolves, and it’s allowed to bounce and run out to the left side. Eventuallly Cutrone flashes in a ball that Rui Patricio grabs.49 min: Boly is booked after quite blatantly checking Richarlison. Fast start to this half too.48 min: And now some fine work from Sigurdsson almost tees Kean up in a far more dangerous position, but a defender gets there first.47 min: Kean takes aim and has an early shot deflected behind. One thing Wolves did do well in the first half was offer him little space. The corner is eventually scrambled away.Will it get off to another flyer?Have a look at Ewan Murray’s Old Firm derby match report here:Wolves get one last corner but it’s no problem for Digne to defend. And that’s the half. We had a helter-skelter start here, and a decent game thereafter too. Still a sense that there is all to play for here – do not go anywhere!45+1 min: Traore burns past Digne again and Wolves really need to get him on the ball far more. This time his cross is straightforward for Pickford.44 min: Jimenez is the next player to be booked, cheekily pulling Digne back as he tries to take a quick throw, the scamp.43 min: A scrappy spell. Maybe everyone’s looking to half-time. Bennett chucks in another long throw and Boly heads it on, but Mina defends.41 min: JR in Illinois writes –“Can you please explain VAR to me because I’ve watched a replay of Everton’s second goal multiple times and Sigurdsson is offside when he receives the ball before putting in the cross. And not just a little offside but clearly offside. They even stop the replay at the moment he is clearly offside. So offside that in real time I said ‘No way that goal is going to stand. He was way offside’. Did they even consult VAR? The announcers made no mention of it.

An official website crashed as people across the state logged on to discover their status, while others queued in the rain at local centres.Lawyers have raised serious concerns over the process, which they say has wrongly excluded people on the basis of minor clerical errors in decades-old documents. There are fears that Muslims, women and the poorest communities could be the worst affected.Many of the people left off draft versions of the list were born in Assam and have families that have lived there for generations, according to campaigners. Saibul haq Sikdar, a teacher from Barpeta district in western Assam, read online on Saturday that his name had been rejected. He is the only person excluded in his family, who have lived in Assam for generations.“More than anger I am very sad, because being a citizen of a country and having it declared that you are a foreigner, you don’t know where you stand at this moment,” said Sikdar.The registry authorities said in a statement that the list had been “meticulously carried out in an objective and transparent manner”. About 1.9 million people were excluded.It is not clear what will happen to those who lose their appeals at foreigners tribunals, though many fear they could face detention. There are already several detention facilities in Assam’s prisons, and the state reportedly plans to build an additional 10 camps to house those declared to be migrants.Mithun Deb, from Bongaigaon, said his mother, Alorani, had been in a detention centre since 2016, when her citizenship was questioned.“When we enter the home at night it feels empty. Mother is not there. Not a single night goes when we don’t cry, me and my brother, wondering in what condition she is sleeping, or how she is staying away from us,” he told the  on Friday night. Alorani was excluded from a draft version of the NRC, even though her sisters were included.Anyone excluded from the final list has 120 days to appeal against the decision through a foreigners tribunal, but campaigners say these bodies are vulnerable to political pressures and have produced arbitrary judgments.Teesta Setalvad, the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace, a group that is supporting affected communities, said the tribunals should be made more transparent, and that a more realistic deadline for appeals is needed.“It is a nightmare. I cannot even think of how it is going to be possible,” she said.“If the authorities are serious about a proper and fair process they should not hold the threat of a time-bound process over the heads of poor and unlettered people,” said Setalvad.The register was primarily targeted at people whom authorities describe as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, which shares a border with Assam. There is significant resentment towards immigration in the state, and there was an anti-migrant movement in the 1980s.Amnesty International said it was unrealistic to expect people from the poorest communities, who may have been internally displaced by violence or natural disasters, to preserve half a century-old records.The process is also weighed against women, campaigners said, because they often lack access to necessary documents, and because the ones they do have are incorrectly given less weight by authorities.Aakar Patel, the head of Amnesty International India, warned the state of Assam is “on the brink of a crisis which would not only lead to a loss of nationality and liberty of a large group of people but also erosion of their basic rights”.There are concerns that Muslim communities could be worst affected. Separately from the register, the governing Bharatiya Janata party is pursuing a citizenship amendment bill, which aims to give citizenship to religious group such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and others who are minorities in neighbouring countries – but not to Muslims.In its manifesto the BJP also promised to introduce NRC elsewhere in the country, though some BJP leaders in Assam have criticised the process. India’s home minister, Amit Shah, has previously promised to deport immigrants, describing them as “termites”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e583d3ab87869464228762e16f8693ea0b1f542/0_204_5315_3190/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4d44e7bbef2ddafb298604c13b61c1a","title":"five ways sober curious success not drinking","story":"Staying alcohol-free at social events can be daunting, but be open to the new experience and own it“The first step is to get really clear about why you are abstaining,” Warrington says. “Maybe you’re sick of hangovers, want to perform better at work, or have a health and fitness goal. It can help to write these reasons down somewhere you can access them easily, to remind yourself when you feel your resolve wavering.”Once you’ve established your reasoning, Warrington says that you should continue to attend social functions, seeing them as “sober firsts”. “Weddings can be extra challenging, as these are some of our booziest get-togethers,” she says. “Go into these and any other ‘sober firsts’ with an open mind, and stay curious about what the experience will be like sober. If you’re used to drinking, staying sober can even be a different kind of altered state – with all the surprises, the highs and the lows.”With the alcohol-free market expanding, and some estimates anticipating it to grow by a third in the next three years, there are plenty of options available to replace your usual tipple of choice at a social function. Warrington recommends a tonic with bitters as being “more grown up than ordering a Coke”, while a record £57m was spent on non-alcoholic beers in Britain over the past year.Kate Bee, the founder of Sober School – a sobriety training course for women – emphasises the need to be confident about your decision. “Really own it and never apologise for not drinking,” she says. “Instead, smile brightly and say: ‘I’m not drinking at the moment and I can’t believe how much I’m enjoying it.’ Even if you have to fake that enthusiasm it’s worth it. It’s much harder for people to pressure you to drink if you’re happy being alcohol-free.”When undergoing such a potentially life-altering change, it is important to discuss what you are doing with friends and gain their support, according to Warrington. “Let your friends know about your journey as that can be one of the most powerful means of encouragement,” she says. “And when they see you’re capable of it, they might decide to try it for themselves, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58cac676cd3261b7972dbe19803dfb8d0feec639/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed81e450fd8212a78e5aacded9bd6a19","title":"how to clone your own begonias","story":"Begonias are a bargain if you grow them yourselfAs regular readers will know, I have become a bit of a begonia obsessive. And with all sorts of new species being introduced from the jungles of Asia, it seems after years in the doldrums these exotic houseplants are finally experiencing a much-deserved renaissance. In fact, rarer specimens now frequently exchange hands online for almost £100, which continually surprises me considering how easy it is to clone these plants for free.While there are loads of different propagation methods for begonias, many are only suitable for very specific varieties, which can make the whole process confusing for non-geeks. However, there is one that in my experience works for any variety going and, as luck would have it, is also by far the simplest. If you fancy trying your hand at cloning your own begonias, now is a good time of year to do it and all you really need is a glass of water.Finally, sit your glass of water in a bright, well-lit spot out of direct sunlight, a place where you can comfortably read the small print of a paper without squinting from the glare of sunlight. Keep an eye on the water level to ensure this doesn’t dry out, especially given the small size of the container. Within a few weeks, most of your cuttings should be sending out roots and once these get to about 3cm long they will be ready to pot up in regular seed and cutting compost.From one smallish plant you should be able to get up to five cuttings at a time, to give you plenty to share with your friends and family. And, as all plant parents will know, there is no gift quite a wonderful as a plant you grew yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79ccdf5af0c56f2f7021f91f853edae2c7365967/0_296_5197_3119/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12c59efc11f5615ef45a4378509c579e","title":"how to cool down after exercise","story":"We are taught from childhood that warming up is a must in preparation for any exercise. It allows us to gear our muscles up for the strain we are about to place on them and prevent injury. More importantly, it steadily increases the heart rate and circulation, which loosens joints and increases blood flow to the muscles. These all help towards an effective workout.But cooling down is as important as warming up. It prevents dizziness, helps return the heart rate back to normal and prevents chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Also known as “blood pooling”, CVI occurs when the blood in blood vessels expands during prolonged exercise, making it difficult for it to return to the heart from the legs.According to many health and fitness instructors, the total cool-down period should last three to 10 minutes, or until you are ready to stop. Areas to target depend on which part of the body you trained. For example, if you have been working your legs, you will need to do lower body stretches or a slow walk. There are many helpful tutorials online.The best way to measure whether you have cooled down effectively is purely based on common sense – if you feel your heart rate has reduced, that’s enough. If you wear a heart rate monitor, that will also tell you once your heart rate has returned to normal. There is no research to prove stretching after a session will help reduce soreness, but if you feel it helps, there is no harm in it, do so – it is down to personal preference. Cooling down methods, including foam rollers, a sports massage or dry needling are worth investigating. If you experience any pain when stretching, stop, and consult your doctor or a physio if the pain is there the next day, and, more importantly, warm up more thoroughly next time.Callum Nicholls is a trainer at Third Space and Barry’s Bootcamp.

Lucy Vine raises a glass to the month of neverending summerAt the risk of alienating any weather-grumps out there, I’m going to start by saying this in caps: GOD I LOVE SUMMER. I love the sun and the paddling pools and the noise from literally everyone in the world standing outside my local pub. I love people at work turning up in shorts and moaning happily about back sweat. I love constantly losing my sunglasses and looking blank when my mum tells me the names of the blooming flowers in my garden. Summer is clearly the very best of seasons. Full of joyful socialising and people actually smiling at each other.What I don’t love, however, is this thing we all seem to do whenever the end of August arrives – that oddly British tradition where we all look at each other and go: “Well then, that’s summer done for another year.”The reason this irritates me is simple: because it’s not true! The season isn’t over just because August is over. In fact – to paraphrase Frank Sinatra – the best month is yet to come. September should always, categorically, be included when we think of our summer months.September is, almost without exception, lovely. It brings its own kind of magic to the season, with glorious sunshine, but also red-golden falling leaves and long, bright, breezy days. You can still sit outside, still go barefoot in flip-flops, still enjoy a tasty early evening Grey Goose vodka cocktail. My favourite drink for those sunny September weekends was recommended to me by a bartender last year. It’s the Grey Goose le Grand Fizz – a delightful, heady mix of Grey Goose vodka, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, fresh lime and soda water, with ice. It’s everything September-y in a glass cool, refreshing, delicious joy. And there is nothing more perfect than sitting on a roof terrace somewhere with friends, the sound of clinking ice around you.I will admit, sometimes I get accused by loved ones of being cynical. A determined pessimist, one might say. But not in September. There is something about this month that draws out the optimist in me. Something new and exciting in the air that creeps in – I am happier, more inspired, and I see it in others around me, too. People are wider-eyed, refreshed, ready to take on new projects and plan new adventures. It’s the time of year to begin again, to achieve, to try. It’s an opportunity to elevate every occasion. September is when I plan my trips, it’s when I arrange to see friends, it’s when I date. September energises me. I feel magnetic, sociable and playful in September, I feel brave and bold. It makes me restless in a good way twitchy for parties and spontaneous fun.September is a dreamy month, as well, if you prefer cosy evenings in. You’re no longer under pressure to get outside for the sake of making the most of the sun. Cardigans can make a comeback from that distant, forgotten shelf in your wardrobe. The new season of telly begins, and with it all the 60-minute dramas starring Richard Madden you can handle. Plus, after months of picking at smoothies and salads, you can eat proper meals again. Pasta! Roast dinners! Potatoes! And there’s nothing like an after-dinner cocktail in your garden of an early evening to top off your day. My favourite post-dinner drink is the Grey Goose Espresso Martini with Grey Goose vodka, a single original finest quality espresso, coffee liqueur and a pinch of salted dark chocolate powder to garnish.And so, the campaign starts here join me in giving September the credit it deserves. It’s time to stop treating the ninth month like summer’s ugly stepchild. It’s time to stop drawing the blinds down on the season before we should. It’s time to embrace our inner optimist and this wonderful, joyful, neverending summer.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffeac2e0923b2d15ea9af0b985ea4d0218ccd1c/0_0_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f69bb1d4d9c32a325322db821a8e04","title":"celebrate the day how to plan a gathering at the last minute","story":"Summer is the season for spontaneity, so why not make the most of bright days and long nights with a spur-of-the-moment do? Here’s our guide to making it a night to rememberWhen was the last time you had an impromptu get-together? There’s always a good reason not to. On Friday night, you’re tired from work. Saturday comes, and you just want to relax after a busy week. And on Sunday, well, it’s Monday tomorrow!But there are really so many reasons to organise a do at short notice, from a surprise bank holiday heatwave to keeping the holiday vibes going after you’ve returned from a sunny beach trip abroad. To make sure your last-minute shindig is one to remember, here are a few tips to elevate your soiree without breaking a sweat.Curate the guest listForget Facebook. In 2019 we WhatsApp. Forming a WhatsApp group for your party creates a space for invitees who don’t know each other to break the ice, and keeps your guest list to only people who know you well enough to have their number, not whoever you feel obliged to add as you scroll through every person you’ve ever met since 2006. If two invitees are exes, invite both, tell them to discuss who (if not both) should attend, and assure them they’ll both be ejected if they start rowing in the kitchen. As far as inviting colleagues goes, best to limit it to people in your after-work drinks crew.Choose a second-in-commandPerhaps the most important tip is to select a good friend to help you keep an eye on food and drink, playlist coups, general tidying and other party admin to keep your own stress levels low. They can even subtly begin the party exodus on your command, so long as they’re the sort of pal you can turn to and say: “Right, I’ve had enough, get everyone out now.” We all need a friend like that.Democratise the playlistThere’s nothing more irritating than guests commandeering the music, but once the drinks have started flowing, people will inevitably try their luck. Avoid this by inviting your guests to help with the playlist. Ask each to send a couple of suggestions when they confirm they’re coming, whack it all together on Spotify and then dilute it with your own picks – it’s your party, you deserve that.Don’t be precious over glassesYou can get those plastic throwaway champagne flutes and martini glasses nowadays, but frankly it’s a waste of money and plastic. We’re in Britain, so chances are your household will have at least 20 perfectly useable mugs of varying taste levels in your cupboards, and anyone who judges you for using these shouldn’t be on the guestlist in the first place. There’s enough plastic being dumped into the world without you adding extra because you can’t be bothered to wash up at the end of your do – and that’s what the aforementioned second-in-command is for, anyway.Encourage photography, not selfiesInstagram is a wonderful thing, but in the age of Stories, selfies and #squadlife, it’s easy to forget that photos used to be something you had to wait for. That is, you had to finish a roll of film, then go and get it developed, and all with no idea of what the results would look like. But that was part of the fun of course, and – dare I say it – encouraged people to take better, more spontaneous and authentic photos. So, rather than posing for endless posts, why not pick up four or five disposable cameras and distribute them among your friends to take pics throughout the evening? The classic Kodak single-use is still great for colour shots, or for a touch of perennial monochrome cool, try Ilford’s range of black and white disposables.Make some nibbles to rememberIt’s really easy to make simple food feel a bit fancy with just a few additions. Fill paper cups with salted popcorn mixed with spices like za’atar and sumac for a warming, Middle Eastern twist, or toss some walnut halves in a pan with soy sauce to make a crunchy salad topping brimming with umami. You can also roast broccoli with olive oil, salt, garlic, fresh chilli and lemon juice for plant-based finger food that’s surprisingly tasty – and won’t have your guests feeling lethargic a couple of hours after eating. A homemade dip is an easy way to impress too – tzatziki is a personal favourite, and I like to use Nigel Slater’s recipe, minus the dill.Don’t forget the detailsIt’s the little things that make a party flow: lime wedges stored in the fridge, waiting to be plopped into drinks wifi password shared before guests arrive extra toilet paper lots of – and I can’t stress this enough – kitchen roll and sun cream! Try and pre-empt the sorts of details guests might need during the party, and have them out, ready and signposted. If nothing else, it’ll stop them interrupting you in the middle of dancing to Beyoncé.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b79a7e2987eaafcaffc6a5d4f8cc7940d4c479/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eaf594b0978f249bbff150ec2b4ef70","title":"its about the morning afters why the joy of friendship isnt found in the big moments","story":"Great friendships aren’t forged on the big nights out, but the spontaneous moments when the phones are forgotten about, and conversation and laughter flows freely, says Lauren BravoMy best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we’ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we’re teenagers again. Only with much better hair.Increasingly I’m realising it’s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins.Far and away my favourite moment of freshers’ week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose’s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices.Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They’re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now – not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself it was the Bloody Marys with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone’s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw.It’s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged – not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It’s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it’s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies.And that’s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments the weddings, the birthday drinks, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: “pub?”The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure – but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you’re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The dinners where it takes so long to catch up on everyone’s top-line news that you’re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion.So it’s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people – and the other people you connect with. Maybe it’s the friend who drags you to their weird evening class once a month, and rewards you with a good cocktail afterwards. The pal who will get up at dawn to drive to a car boot sale, then talk you out of buying a three-foot high stuffed fox (“it’s kitsch!”). Your film buff mate who will come over to watch arty foreign-language flicks with an armful of continental cheeses, knowing you’re both going to talk the whole way through, Espresso Martinis in hand. Your Eurovision crew, your board games gang, your summer solstice picnic posse. Here’s an idea: every time you say “we should do this every weekmonthyear!”, why not try … actually doing that? Leave your phone in your bag. Skip the administrative catch-up and talk about whatever crosses your mind instead. Let a nothingy Tuesday night mean as much, if not more than celebrating a birthday, an engagement or promotion – and mix up some suitably convivial cocktails to match. Blood Orange Sangrias, anyone?Don’t hang around waiting for the next Big Life Moment to get together with your friends. Because every shared evening, every new in-joke and every Seemingly Inconsequential Pow-wow (SIP?) is absolutely worth toasting, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5a3b8ed588960a0173deec5fde9da69607c437/0_184_4392_2636/master/4392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63107758f1d54ca423dd773bec8c3b08","title":"eu citizens are you experiencing settled status issues in the uk","story":"If you have encountered problems applying to the EU settlement scheme or your application has been denied, share your stories with usEU citizens living in Britain have asked the government for clarification on their status in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

There is a lot of work being done in preparation for next Tuesday.”His comments came as it was reported that Boris Johnson is expected to stop Conservative MPs standing at the next election if they vote to block a no-deal Brexit.The prime minister is expected to treat next week’s Commons votes as a no-confidence vote in his government, with rebel Conservatives to be disqualified from contesting their seats, the Sun reported.With parliament returning on Tuesday, Johnson is understood to be aiming to persuade some MPs not to rebel as he hopes to quell an attempt to introduce legislation through parliament to delay Brexit beyond 31 October.Protesters have taken to the streets across the country in response to Johnson’s plan to prorogue parliament.Thousands of people gathered in George Square in the centre of Glasgow at a People’s Assembly Defend Democracy rally against the prorogation of parliament.Corbyn is expected to be among the speakers, marking the end of his three-day visit to Scotland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b15f32d80d821107cd47a27dd83c855ac1b5b2/0_218_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55b67261d3f9b6b5c5c0c631c17c3c0d","title":"sajid javid defends settled status scheme","story":"Campaigners point to rise in grants for pre-settled status, which has fewer rightsSajid Javid has responded to concerns raised over thousands of EU citizens in the UK having no legal rights after 31 October , by saying “there shouldn’t be a single person that should be concerned about their status”.The settled status scheme has been running since March for EU nationals living in the UK to establish their permanent right to live in Britain.Campaigners have questioned whether the system is designed to favour awarding pre-settled status in complex cases, so the Home Office can avoid having to refuse any applications, while numerous long-term UK residents said they were wrongly given pre-settled status.Javid, the former home secretary, told the BBC’s Today programme that the system was working “incredibly well”.He added: “It has already seen more than a million EU citizens in the UK use this programme. They all have until December 2020 at least to use that programme. Until then, nothing will change in terms of their status and rights. This is well set out.“There shouldn’t be a single person that should be concerned about their status. We are very lucky to have almost 3.5 million EU citizens contributing so much to the economy and culture, and we want them all to stay and nothing will get in the way of that.”Although people have at least until 31 December 2020 to apply, interest in applying surged after the home secretary, Priti Patel, said free movement would end on 31 October in the event of a no-deal Brexit, lawyers said.The online system experienced technical issues last week with long delays.It comes after the pro-Brexit Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said he was seeing EU nationals being denied settled status, despite their years of residence in the UK. He called on the home secretary to address this “before we end up with another Windrush scandal”.The Home Office said it has not rejected anyone who has applied for the scheme, and to date had granted either settled status or pre-settled status to more than a million applicants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ad9acb1f182ee2d1f5d3b9e1584f158fb32df2b/0_59_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d304df75a63a02cfd90e221ea777485","title":"brexit gove refuses rule out ignoring law passed stop no deal ","story":"Labour and Tory rebels criticise comments as minister insists there will be no food shortagesMichael Gove has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility that the government could ignore any law passed by parliament to stop a no-deal Brexit and insisted there would be no food shortages if the UK did crash out of the EU on 31 October.The comments by Gove drew condemnation from both Labour, the SNP and Conservative rebels, including one Tory MP who said it showed democracy was under threat.Gove, who is in charge of planning for no deal, did not commit to abide by any law which rebel MPs will attempt to pass this week that could mandate an extension to article 50 in the event of no deal.“Let’s see what the legislation says,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “You’re asking me about a pig in a poke. And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.”Prorogation is the official term that marks the end of a parliamentary session. After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen’s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills that have been passed during that session and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen’s speech at the formal state opening of parliament.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Gove’s hints that the government may ignore legislation was a major escalation. “The Tory attack on our democracy is getting worse. Gove has just refused to confirm.. that the government will accept legislation passed by Parliament,” he tweeted.The Conservative MP Guto Bebb, a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: “This government’s unprecedented willingness to flout the rules is a disgrace to our democracy.“Not only are they suspending parliament to try and force through a disastrous no deal, but now they are suggesting that, even if parliament passed a law requiring the government to avoid no deal, they might simply ignore it. Our very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government.”Bebb said Gove had admitted no deal was not what he had campaigned for in the 2016 referendum. “Now he’s willing to tear up our democratic system to force this outcome on the country, against the wishes of both parliament and the public,” he said.“The Brexiters in government like to cloak themselves in the language of democracy, but they willingly ignore basic democratic principles as and when it suits them.”Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a “dangerous time for democracy” when ministers could not answer yes or no to whether they would abide by the law. “Not so much prorogue as just plain rogue,” she tweeted. “We mustn’t allow this behaviour to be normalised.”Gove said there would be no shortages of fresh food in the event of no deal but said food prices could potentially rise. “Everyone will have the food they need,” he said.When asked if prices would increase, Gove said: “I think that there are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.”Gove, who is chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, officially launched the Cabinet Office’s £100m Get Ready for Brexit campaign on Sunday. It will include television, radio and billboard advertising, billed as the government’s biggest ever public information campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44b02a04642a1533af5bf6a44216b95776bae7d3/0_34_5885_3530/master/5885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0720d67ea92ea55d666ad20c4764ce41","title":"britain coup parliament suspend prorogue brexit","story":"Historian and political commentatorThe British constitution is unlike any other in the world. You cannot find it in a bookshop or read it online. It has no manual or handbook. Instead, it is a delicate assemblage of laws, practices and institutions, built over centuries and held together by a fragile tissue of customs, conventions and understandings. It relies on trust and on a common commitment to its unwritten rules. That has allowed it to adapt and evolve, but leaves it dangerously vulnerable to the abuse of power.Boris Johnson’s predecessors were often careless with the constitution, but none showed such contempt for its core principles. The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy, in which “the will of the people” flows through our elected representatives. Our claim to be democratically governed rests on this slender foundation: that a government must command the confidence of the elected chamber. By wielding the royal prerogative to silence parliament, Johnson has struck at the foundations of our democracy.Johnson is perhaps the first prime minister in British history who does not recognise parliament, or a parliamentary election, as the source of his authority. He was placed in No 10 by 90,000 party activists – not much larger than a single constituency – whom he courted through his column in the Daily . He appointed Dominic Cummings to the heart of government: a man who months earlier had been found to be in contempt of parliament. Once, that would have disbarred him from office. Today, it is a programme for government.He will claim a higher mandate than parliament: “the will of the people”, expressed in the referendum. Yet it gave no instruction on the terms of Brexit, a fact Johnson exploited to vote down a previous withdrawal agreement. Once we decide that someone other than parliament should interpret the referendum – that some heroic leader knows more truly what was in the mind of voters – we are walking a very dangerous road.In the short term, prorogation may succeed. If Johnson goes for no deal, it makes it harder for MPs to stop him. If he wrings some kind of package from the EU, it may frighten some into backing it. If all else fails, it clears the way for a “people versus parliament” election.But at what cost? Like loggers torching the Brazilian rainforest, Johnson and adviser Dominic Cummings have traded short-term profit for devastating structural harm. They have set precedents that others will follow and scorched the fragile ecosystem of our democracy. “Conservatives” once saw it as their responsibility to protect the constitution. How times change.Conservative MP and adviser to Leave Means Leave Yes, there is a coup being attempted, but it’s not by the government. It is by a group of hardline Remainers who refuse to accept the will of the British people.These non-democrats are trying to seize power from the legitimate government of Boris Johnson, and install a so-called government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn, and stuffed full of uber-Remainers, with not a single Leaver in sight!The prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson is a long-overdue restoration of parliamentary democracy. In fact, the shadow leader of the house and other opposition MPs have been demanding this for months. The current session of parliament covers three calendar years and is by far the longest since the civil war. Each session of parliament normally lasts a year. It starts with the Queen’s speech, where the government outlines the bills it wants to get through in the next 12 months, and if it doesn’t get them through in that time, it risks losing them.The opposition then have a number of days to debate and scrutinise , in detail, the government’s programme. At the end of the debate it can try to amend the Queen’s speech or defeat it. If the Queen’s speech is defeated, it inevitably leads to a general election. It also resets the parliamentary calendar, which, under parliament’s standing orders, allows opposition parties 20 days where they choose the motions to be debated, 35 days when the backbench business committee chooses the subjects to be debated, and 13 days when MPs can introduce legislation.Proroguing parliament clearly restores parliamentary democracy and is constitutionally standard. This is not an attempt to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. Had the prime minister prorogued parliament until 1 November, that would have been a constitutional outrage, and I would have been the first to call it out.If Jeremy Corbyn wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, he has to follow a simple course of action. On Tuesday, he calls a vote of no confidence in the government, and on Wednesday he tries to win that vote. He won’t do that because he knows that he doesn’t have the votes in the House of Commons and, more importantly, he doesn’t have the votes in the country to win a general election. My message to Jeremy Corbyn is simple – put up, or shut up!Labour MP for Derby SouthYes. It’s clever – which is the reputation of the PM’s advisers. It’s also ruthless and improper – which is also their reputation.Supporters claim having an autumn recess or prorogation and a new Queen’s speech is “normal”. Autumn 2019 finds us on the brink of the biggest constitutional change for more than 40 years. Yet a government without a working majority, led by a PM without a public mandate, seeks the longest adjournment for 70 years. This is not “normal”.To me this is the latest, most dangerous, manifestation of a rolling coup parliamentarians have been battling since 2016. From the outset, Theresa May sought for powers to be returned to and exercised by the executive, not parliament.She had to be forced by the courts to accept that MPs should have any voice in the decision to trigger article 50. When detailed legislative changes were required, sweeping and unfettered powers for ministers were proposed. Almost every request for papers to be published or information shared was rejected and fought.The suggestion that MPs should be allowed a “meaningful” vote on her proposals was strongly resisted.The approach to government defeats in the Commons – once a matter of concern or at least embarrassment – became quite cavalier.In Opposition day debates the government stopped voting to defend their policies on any but rare occasions - usually when they thought that they might win.Concern was expressed even in the Conservative party, at this unprecedented but ingenious way of making the expressed view of the House of Commons nugatory, or meaningless, in its effect.For almost three years, government used and abused its considerable powers to control what MPs were allowed to debate and when, often hindering or even preventing the House of Commons from expressing its view on the government’s handling of Brexit.When final proposals were known, debate and decision on them was delayed, week on week, month on month, blaming those who it was feared might not support the government. Then, when the government could delay no longer and it went down to the biggest defeat in our parliamentary history on its flagship policy, even this defeat was just ignored, and the government pressed on regardless.The parliament to which we were told sovereignty was being restored has been steadily sidelined, ignored and has now been silenced.So it is a coup – but it’s just the latest step in the incremental trashing of our unwritten constitution, as longstanding conventions are disregarded and discarded. Dangerous precedents are being set.National organiser for Another Europe Is PossibleAn unelected prime minister is attempting to prevent parliament from meeting because it might disagree with him. His aim is to drive through Brexit – deal or no deal – by an arbitrary date in late October. In doing so, he hopes to solidify a huge parliamentary majority in a snap election marked by a rightwing populist campaign demonising foreigners and what he will decry as the political elite. He is, as Britain’s 20th Etonian prime minister, apparently not a member of this elite himself.The longer-term aim of Johnson’s plan goes much deeper. Brexit Britain is to be a deregulated country, brought closer into the orbit of Trump’s America. Workers’ rights, food standards and environmental protections are to be undermined. Public services and the NHS will, as made clear by the US government, be up for sale. Naturally, there is little to no public support for this agenda, and no majority for it in parliament. So Johnson does not want to allow either the public or MPs to vote on it until it is too late.Parliament has not been completely shut down. The press is still free. But not all coups come with tanks and internet shutdowns. Yes, we have our civil rights – but try telling that to the millions of migrants who face a future of uncertainty, and even deportation, if the government goes ahead with abruptly ending free movement. The executive is waging war on the legislature, and it might win if we do not mobilise to stop it.This government is not going to be persuaded by strength of argument. It must be forced to reverse course. Hopefully, the opposition parties will win this week in the Commons, but as citizens we must understand that we cannot rely on parliamentary process, or the judiciary. The little democracy we have was fought for, bled for, by mass movements which stretched the boundaries of legitimate dissent. If protest movements are not willing to disrupt, they are toothless.The suspension of parliament is not some maverick act of hubris. The shutting down of democracy, the attacks on rights, the absurd claim to represent the people while denying them agency – these are the essence of the Brexit project. Brexit is not the end – it is a tool to entrench power and privilege, to ide working people against each other, and aggrandise the sociopaths who fronted the Leave campaign and now occupy No 10. This absurd, dangerous moment is the natural conclusion of Brexit. This is its true meaning.We are witnessing the growth of a huge movement in defence of democracy. From Monday, we’ll be protesting daily at 5.30pm across the country. Join us at stopthecoup.org.uk.Director of the Constitution Unit, University College LondonBoris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament has sparked demonstrations under the banner #StopTheCoup. But is this outrage justified?Make no mistake, to prorogue like this is far from normal. Yes, a short prorogation (usually a few days) happens routinely between one annual parliamentary session and the next. But this five-week prorogation is the longest since 1930. It has also been triggered in the midst of a political crisis, with the clock ticking down to 31 October. It immediately follows a five-week summer break, during which MPs could not scrutinise the government’s Brexit policy. Indeed, Johnson has faced just one day of parliamentary scrutiny since becoming PM. Should the prorogation go ahead, that would become one week’s scrutiny over almost three months. By 14 October, when MPs are set to return, fewer than three weeks would remain until the Brexit deadline.No 10 insists that parliament was already due to break up for weeks for the party conferences. But this is disingenuous, for two reasons. First, it had not yet been decided. And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose – and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this – and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote.So Johnson’s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs’ desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament’s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation.Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it’s hard to define what’s “unconstitutional” in a system with an unwritten constitution.Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A “political” constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely.The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3c84b68a61f87e87ab6f4ceb74fe2b634c13a90/0_0_712_427/master/712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a5d6117fe8233cf794193913e0d5fc","title":"get ready for brexit government launches information blitz","story":"Public advertising campaign said to be country’s biggest ever urges Britons to visit websiteThe billboards have been unveiled, the branded mugs have been ordered, and the adverts will soon start following you around the internet after the government launched what it claimed to be the largest ever public information campaign in an effort to prepare the British public for leaving the EU.The Get Ready for Brexit campaign went live on Sunday, stating that the UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October and urging the public to visit a new website to check what they need to do to prepare for a no-deal exit. The slogan appeared for the first time on a giant advertising screen next to a John Lewis at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, looming over shoppers arriving for an end-of-summer shopping trip.Downing Street has previously briefed that the taxpayer-funded advertising campaign will cost up to £100m, although doubts have been raised over whether the government will realistically be able to spend that much on a campaign lasting just two months. One leading ad industry source pointed out that this figure was substantially higher than the amount spent on traditional advertising in the UK by major consumer brands such as Amazon, Tesco and Asda in the whole of 2018.This suggests that either the government is overstating the amount it intends to spend in an attempt to draw extra attention, or that Downing Street really is launching an advertising campaign that will be unequalled in its ubiquity.The Get Ready campaign, which shares its name with both a song by the Temptations and an album by New Order, is likely to incorporate TV, radio, newspaper and online adverts. Roadshows are expected to take place across the country, and online video tutorials are promised. According to the Times a substantial order has been placed for branded mugs and T-shirts, amid claims that the government briefly considered reusing the Vote Leave slogan “take back control” on the official campaign.Theresa May’s administration spent relatively small amounts, measured in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, on publicly funded advertising campaigns supporting her abandoned withdrawal agreement in the run-up to the original Brexit deadline in March.This is not the first public information campaign called Get Ready for Brexit. Dutch port operators launched a website with the same name in January, suggesting foreign countries may have been doing their best to educate businesses on the risks of a disorderly Brexit for longer than the UK government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c94693b389ec03dce2474ffcf6f7bad0f8b41d/0_165_4487_2692/master/4487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b27e08a37de61bfc7ce1fc2dfb85690","title":"javid greets britains big moment splash cash short termism austerity","story":"An end to austerity beckons, but the threat of recession resulting from a no-deal Brexit makes the chancellor’s strategy riskyAs Sajid Javid prepares to deliver his spending round statement this week, Britain is yet again on the brink of another week of Brexit chaos. But in his debut Commons set piece, the chancellor will be looking to make another point to distract from the turmoil to mark a potentially pivotal turning point: the end of austerity.Thanks to the hard work of people in Britain, he will undoubtedly say, the decade of fiscal restraint has now run its course. This is a big moment for the country: public services will get the money they badly need, and Britain will live within its means.There have been turning points in the public finances throughout history, when the spending taps are turned off and services are squeezed, before an eventual backlash as services come under strain, forcing the taps back on again.From the Geddes Axe cuts of the Conservative–Liberal coalition of the 1920s to fix the public finances after the first world war, and a similar act by the wartime coalition of the 1940s, there have been more than a dozen periods of belt-tightening in the past century.Since the spending squeeze imposed by the Conservative–Lib Dem coalition in the early 2010s, Britain has been subjected to one of the longest periods of restraint on record. More than half of current MPs have no parliamentary experience from before the banking crash, entering parliament since 2010 and knowing only the austerity age, as have millions of young voters who have turned 18 since.But for the first time since the imposition of austerity in 2010, Javid’s spending round is expected to mark the return of real-terms gains for overall departmental spending. That has not happened since 2007 – back when the chancellor was still selling risky bonds in the boom years of his investment banking career.But there is one big problem with declaring this return to normal: the political and economic situation is anything but. Britain is on the cusp of recession and a no-deal Brexit is likely to make matters worse.For that reason the spending review is only covering a 12-month period. The big decisions will need to come afterwards, given the huge scale of the uncertainty for the public finances should Britain crash out without a deal.The turning point this week is therefore more about the formalisation of a series of ad-hoc policy announcements gearing the country up for a showdown, rather than the proper end of austerity required.There are two issues it will confront. Javid says the spending round is about clearing the decks to allow greater focus on Brexit, but it will do anything but. Attempting to schedule time in the Commons this week is about running down the clock, robbing MPs of time to debate the impact of Boris Johnson extracting Britain from the EU do or die.It is also about paving the way for a possible general election. Leading voters to the polling stations is invariably accompanied by tax cuts or spending increases. Johnson will hope that splashing the cash sends a message: trust me. I can carry off Brexit and raise your living standards all at the same time.The Tories have shaken the magic money tree with abandon, producing crowd-pleasing dollops of cash for public services since Johnson’s elevation to No 10 in July.Taken together, the government’s announcements so far total about £6bn of extra spending and borrowing in 2020-21, with the largest chunk going towards reversing cuts to per-pupil funding in schools. The government will also reveal the cost of hiring 20,000 more police officers, and about £1.8bn has been announced for hospitals.But it is a high-risk strategy when a no-deal Brexit could sink the country into recession and damage the public finances, making it tough to bring about the end of austerity.The chancellor said last week that there would be no “blank cheque” for departments and that he would stay within the fiscal rules set by his predecessor, Philip Hammond.The chancellor probably has headroom of about £14bn to stay within the rules next year on the forecasts for the economy he is using, based on the assessment made by the Office for Budget Responsibility in March.But the promises shouldn’t be worth much, as the economy has changed significantly since then. Javid is escaping proper scrutiny by using these forecasts to talk about ending austerity while keeping the country’s finances on an even keel.The Resolution Foundation estimates that a true reflection of the finances to account for Britain skirting recession in recent months cuts his headroom by £10bn. According to Yael Selfin, the chief economist of KPMG, a no-deal Brexit could damage the public purse to the tune of about £40bn.“It would not make sense to rush any additional spending at this stage,” she said. “It makes sense to be prudent and say: ‘I’m going to hold back to leave a bit of margin for Brexit.’”Either way, the public finances will look very different by the end of the year, making this week’s spending review a short-term project: the promise to remain in keeping with the fiscal rules will be broken in months, if not weeks.All of this brings back ironic memories of the long-term economic plan, the ubiquitous soundbite of David Cameron and George Osborne. It had been the key plank of the 2015 election campaign, helping the Conservatives to win an unexpected majority against Ed Miliband.That too was electioneering rhetoric, but at least considered management of the economy over a longer period of time than Javid is working towards.Britain badly needs a long-term economic plan. But there is no such strategy as Javid and Johnson look to get through the next few weeks.The UK has significant scope to raise spending on public services, given historically low borrowing costs on the international market. The deficit has been cut down to a 17-year low. Rather than a panic-driven spending round, real issues must be tackled over the long term, such as reducing child poverty, improving social care, fixing the country’s productivity puzzle and reversing cuts to local council services.A turning point might have arrived. But Javid could be leading us dangerously in the wrong direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05dea2b553adc58b4d41dbb0e644d9e0e17fbae8/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e90280a5e7b41dd5d6ee55cbf5873893","title":"passports pets gb stickers brexit advice issued britons","story":"The Get Ready website uses multiple choice questions to offer tailored informationRenew your passport earlier than planned, buy a GB sticker for your car, and prepare to wait four months before you can take your pet ferret on holiday: this is among the advice offered by the government’s new Brexit website for British citizens planning to travel to the EU after 31 October.The Get Ready site, which is accompanied by a major advertising campaign, launched on Sunday and unequivocally states that Brexit will happen by the end of next month. It asks users a series of multiple choice questions and spells out the precautions that iniduals should take immediately to make sure they are prepared for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.British citizens resident in the UK who have become used to easily travelling across Europe are warned to ensure their passport has at least six months to run and told they may once again have to pay roaming charges on their mobile phones.They are also recommended to allow extra time for border checks at ports and airports and told to make sure they have travel insurance as the European health insurance card – which covers the cost of state-provided healthcare in EU countries – will not be valid in the event of a no-deal exit.People taking their UK-registered vehicles abroad will have to carry additional paperwork proving their ownership of the vehicle and potentially obtain an international driving permit, while British drivers will face a fine if they do not stick a large GB sticker on their rear bumper, even if they already have the country listed on their numberplate.Pet passports, which have made it easy for people who regularly travel abroad to take their cat, dog or ferret overseas could become invalid in the event of a no deal, with owners warned it could take up to four months to get the appropriate paperwork and blood tests from vets.Although the Get Ready site largely collates existing government advice, the list of suggestions spells out in exacting detail the impact Brexit will have on people and businesses. EU citizens living in the UK are reminded to apply to the settlement scheme “as soon as possible” if they want to remain in the country, while European students are warned that their Erasmus+ placements at British universities may no longer be valid.The advice is not detailed and does not spell out the seriousness of the consequences for Britons settled in Europe in the event of no deal. Under EU law they will become third country nationals and will not be able to offer services to another EU country automatically or to travel for work in another EU country.The campaign group British in Europe has frequently protested that the British government has forgotten about them. The new website merely advises that “you may not be able to continue living and using services in the EU if you are not a resident”, without spelling out the gravity of the end of free movement for Britons living in the EU.The more complicated warnings are saved for businesses, although the website does not offer a hierarchy of risks. British companies are warned that they may need to pay for extra legal advice, should consider whether they need to appoint agents and representatives based in Europe, and warned of the extra regulation required if they want to continue trading in the EU after Brexit.The site warns manufacturers that they may need to change their labelling, companies that handle the data of EU citizens are told they may no longer be able to access it in the same way, and almost all companies are warned starkly: “You may not be able to trade goods with the EU if you do not get your business ready.”Most of the recommended actions are listed with a warning to “do it as soon as possible”, but with fewer than 60 days to go until the planned Brexit day, small businesses checking the website for the first time may not have time to do the required work.However, the site shows that not everyone is affected by Brexit. British nationals who live and work in the UK, do not run a business and have no plans to travel abroad are told to simply sit back and relax: “Based on your responses, you do not need to take any action to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d3983b83f8c347470457bd319e492499b69718/0_0_6522_3913/master/6522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1286b0df995bbcd3fdb2d1144e61651e","title":"being human wellcome collection exhibition","story":"An unusual astronaut is at the centre of a new exhibition of art and scientific artefacts designed to make us think about everything from our personal lives to the fate of humanity itself“It’s hard to think of a greater challenge to our future health than environmental breakdown,” says Clare Barlow, project curator of Wellcome Collection’s newest gallery. Opening on Thursday 5 September, Being Human is a new permanent exhibit that explores trust, hope and fear, identity and health in the 21st century through four sections: genetics, minds and bodies, infection and environmental breakdown.The space, which for 12 years housed Medicine Now, has been redesigned with reclaimed wood panelling and warm colours by the Turner prize-winning arts and architecture collective Assemble. The exhibition “explores our relationship with ourselves, with each other and with the world around us”, Barlow says. Each of the four sections asks a different question. “With minds and bodies the question is, why do we sometimes act like we value some lives more than others? With environmental breakdown, we ask why it’s so hard for us to act on climate change, when its effects are already here. And with that, the question of how we’re reacting to what’s being lost and how we see ourselves living in the future.”Being Human displays imposing works of art alongside other artefacts, which include seeds withdrawn from the Svalbard global seed vault, a storage facility created by the Norwegian government in 2008 to protect vital crops such as wheat against global disasters, war or disease, and a commercially available gene-editing kit, items intended to ground the conceptual nature of the artworks in a scientific context. These are contrasted with pieces by established artists such as Deborah Kelly’s No Human Being Is Illegal (in All Our Glory), Kia LaBeija’s Eleven, a self-portrait of the black artist, who is living with HIV, and Superflex’s short film Flooded McDonald’s, which questions with whom responsibility for environmental breakdown lies: the customer or the corporation?Visitors move from the genetics section, a “distillation of what makes us us” to an exploration of our relationships with our bodies and minds, then to our relationship with others and, finally, to our relationship with the planet and our grief for what has already been lost. They will be “progressing from things that feel deeply personal, and really allow them to scrutinise questions of identity, to reflecting on the global impact of environmental breakdown”.At the centre of the exhibit is Refugee Astronaut, by British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare. The traveller, wearing a spacesuit of Dutch wax fabric and moon boots, carries a net of possessions on his back containing a telescope, an old camera and a star map, as well as evocatively titled books The Last Migration and The Quest for the Perfect Place. Barlow says these items are jumping-off points from which visitors can create their own idea of where the astronaut is heading.Is the astronaut a refugee from Earth or is the artwork grounded in the current refugee crisis? “It can be read both ways,” says Barlow. “There’s a strong antithesis going on. Astronauts are cosmic explorers and then the word ‘refugee’ ties it to a very specific context. It pulls together so many different ideas, opening up questions around colonialism and the environment.”Shonibare’s commission is the third in the Refugee Astronaut series, which began as criticism of colonialism and exploitation and its historical annexation, explains the artist. Each sculpture’s spacesuit has a different pattern, the latest of which is of green lines and clouds “to signify an ebbing relationship with nature, due to climate change”.It is with good reason that this work serves as the exhibition’s keystone. “Refugee Astronaut is a metaphor for a post-apocalyptic figure, with his worldly possessions on his back, seeking conflict-free and environmentally clean, greener pastures,” says Shonibare. The work can be read either as “dystopian, or a note of caution” against “catastrophic climate events that will increasingly lead to migration and a scramble for scarce resources, leading to global conflict”.The astronaut can be glimpsed from any point in the gallery, a constant reminder of the end point, the “ultimate progression”. “Maybe in this future, leaving Earth will be the only answer,” Barlow muses. “It’s a question mark on the end of the collection’s progression.”Being Human opens on 5 September at the Wellcome Collection, London NW1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

At an emotional meeting, over which the death of F2 driver Anthoine Hubert hung heavily, Leclerc delivered an exceptional, mature, controlled drive for Ferrari to take the flag. Lewis Hamilton was second for Mercedes with his teammate Valtteri Bottas third. Sebastian Vettel was in fourth with Alexander Albon in fifth on his Red Bull debut.The driver from Monaco took the win in an unsurprisingly sombre atmosphere at Spa after the death of Hubert on Saturday. The French driver died after a horrific accident in which his car hit the barriers and was then struck by Juan Manuel Correa. Hubert, a Renault academy driver in his rookie season in F2 died shortly afterwards having been taken to the medical centre. Correa was taken to hospital and underwent surgery for fractured legs and a spinal injury. He is now in a stable condition but still in the intensive care unit.Sunday’s F2 race was cancelled and after the incident the motorsport community came together to pay tribute to Hubert. A one-minute silence was held before the grand prix in remembrance of Hubert, with the drivers wearing black armbands as the grid and spectators showed silent respect for a much admired driver. All the cars also carried “Racing for Anthoine” stickers honouring the Frenchman. On lap 19, Hubert’s car number, the crowd rose as one to give him a standing ovation. The mood was reflected in a quiet, considered podium ceremony, with the traditional winner’s champagne remaining unsprayed on the steps.Despite the sadness and genuine sense of loss across the paddock, Leclerc was able to maintain his professional composure admirably. “It feels good but difficult to enjoy a weekend like this,” he said. “Thanks for everything guys, you are the best, it is a dream come true anyway.”It is his first win after what has been largely a very impressive start in his first season for Ferrari and only his 13th race for the Scuderia, a consummate display of skill and maturity beyond his 21 years. To take the win with considerable pressure weighing on his shoulders was a real achievement, especially after Ferrari had failed to convert several times this season already.It will come as a huge confidence boost after he had dealt so well with the crushing disappointment of seeing an almost certain win snatched away because of a mechanical problem while leading in Bahrain and being beaten by Verstappen in Austria.With the right car he has definitively proved just what he can do, securing Ferrari’s first win this season and their first since the US GP last year.Crucially in this season’s championship battle it was the very least Ferrari required in their battle with Red Bull for second. Hamilton leads Bottas, in second, by 65 points, Verstappen is now 87 points behind in third, with Vettel 12 points behind the Dutchman and Leclerc in fifth 11 behind his teammate.Leclerc maintained his lead off the start while Hamilton jumped Vettel through turn one into second but was easily passed again by the German on the Kemmel Straight as the Ferrari showed its clear power advantage. Max Verstappen hit Raikkonen through turn one, and the Dutchman’s suspension and steering gave out as he went though Eau Rouge and he ended up in the wall, prompting a safety car.Racing resumed on lap five and Leclerc held his lead cleanly and looked confident in clean air putting in repeated fastest laps and 1.8 seconds on his teammate by lap seven.Hamilton believed he was quicker than Vettel and began closing the gap to second place but the Ferrari’s straight-line pace proved too much and Vettel was able to hold his one-second lead. Leclerc, meanwhile, had extended his lead to over three seconds by lap 14.Vettel pitted for the medium tyre on lap 16 but Hamilton and Leclerc stayed out, both drivers told to push by their teams but Vettel on new rubber was putting in quicker times. Leclerc was finally brought in five laps later but Vettel was in front by the time he emerged. Comprehensively quicker than Vettel, the split-stop strategy had gone heavily against Leclerc.Hamilton pitted on lap 22 and came out behind Leclerc, having also lost time on the older rubber. In front, however, Leclerc’s pace was once again clear and he caught Vettel by 26 and Vettel was ordered to let his teammate pass. The German, unable to match Leclerc, did so promptly.Hamilton pursued Vettel vigorously with fresher tyres and on lap 32 passed him at Les Combes for second. Vettel subsequently had to pit again on lap 34, which cost him third place to Bottas. Hamilton hounded Leclerc right to the final lap, closing to within under two seconds but the Ferrari driver held his nerve and composure to take the flag for the first but almost certainly not the last time.Racing Point’s Sergio Pérez was in sixth. Daniil Kvyat was in seventh for Toro Rosso with his teammate Pierre Gasly in ninth. Nico Hulkenberg was in eighth for Renault with Lance Stroll in 10th for Racing Point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e4b1631addaa86705c1ccf58310f1c4f846e483/438_308_2691_1614/master/2691.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d1cbb9b72065bc311e033ac73b0468b","title":"steve smith ashes fourth test old trafford ben stokes joe root","story":"Tomorrow we’ll be sober. (old drinking song)And now tomorrow is almost upon us. (Wednesday this time, cricket likes to keep its followers guessing). New game fresh start all square. England have momentum which indeed proved decisive in 1981 and 2005 when England also hit back spectacularly. On the other hand, as Mike Tyson almost said, everyone has momentum until they get a punch in the mouth.And England have already had one hefty blow: the news that Jimmy Anderson is out of the series and, perhaps, gone from Test cricket. That seems one portent of ill-omen, like a black cat mewing at midnight. Meanwhile, Australia will welcome back Steve Smith, the overwhelmingly dominant figure of the series until he himself got whacked.It is imprudent to erase the despair that engulfed England less than 10 days ago. They produced a one-day performance with the bat on the Friday at Headingley and then another one on the Sunday. The first was disgraceful the second was (insert adulatory adjective of choice from Roget). The first, reproduced again, is likely to get the same result. The second might not: Ben Stokes was (insert different adulatory adjective). But he had to get lucky every hit and did the Aussies only had to get lucky once and didn’t.England’s response is to choose a squad with no unforced changes, and probably the same team, Jason Roy and all. Not that they had much choice. The main purpose of playing county cricket over four days not three (since 1994) and in two isions (2000) was to elevate quality over quantity and provide an efficient flow of talent into the England team.So that’s gone well. There has been one single round of Championship matches since 13 July, 18 days before the Ashes began, and there will not be another until 10 September, two days before the final Test. Dominic Sibley of Warwickshire, considered a front‑runner as a possible next opener, scored 0 and nine in his one match before that break, which happens. This is clearly insane and will get even more insane next year when the Horrible Hundred starts.Earlier this decade, there were three Ashes series in two years, the purpose being to realign the schedule and yank the premier Test series away from the World Cup in the quadrennial cycle. This summer the two were separated by just over a fortnight, a period dominated by Twenty20 matches. The upshot was that England’s home advantage was negated, and they arrived at Edgbaston both underdone and overdone, like a badly barbecued steak.In spite of Headingley, they remain the team under most pressure. Australia, as the team in possession, can lose at Old Trafford and stay alive England can’t. Still, momentum does have a good record in the Ashes. There has not been a drawn series in the last 24, going back to 1972, which is either a statistical quirk or an indication of the extent to which the losing team gets deflated. The good news is that England have not actually lost the Ashes at The Oval (if they held out that long) since 1934. The bad news is the same cannot be said of Old Trafford.It would be terrific for cricket if England can get out of Manchester alive. Why, the TV audience for the decider would be ... oh dear. Sky reported a Test match record of more than two million viewers for the closing stages of Headingley. Which is a bit like me claiming a record for the 1500 metres. It would be more accurate to refer to a personal best.As ever, there will be fascinating subplots. For both sides, the captaincy is now an issue. Joe Root, the conventional wisdom now goes: fine bat, nice chap, not one of God’s captains. This drumbeat will get more urgent if England succumb. But if not Root, who else? The screwed-up system is causing problems here too. Playing for England cuts off the chance to get captaincy experience. Rory Burns ticks that box, but has no settled place Jos Buttler is also now just clinging on. As for Stokes, the lesson of the dire Botham and Flintoff reigns is that the soldier leading the charge should not also be field marshal.Root’s opposite number, Tim Paine, was only ever a stopgap and Australia will have a different captain soon enough. The theme of the series so far has above all been of redemption, first for Smith then for Stokes. There is a growing sense that the captaincy will pass back to Smith.Even illicit sandpaper users deserve a second chance in life. The halfwits will doubtless keep booing Smith, in keeping with Britain’s coarse mood. Decent people should salute a brave and brilliant cricketer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3617ee064a0799204f27f23696b5309e70f63d5/0_256_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74468315e9cc2cfe73517d1ad368a34","title":"formula one belgian grand prix live","story":"Charles Leclerc dedicated his first F1 career win to Anthoine Hubert after pipping Lewis Hamilton to victory in Spa• Leclerc claims first F1 win at Belgian GPRight, thanks for your company. The final word should go to race winner Charles Leclerc, who dedicated his first F1 victory to Anthoine Hubert, who tragically died on Saturday: On one hand, I’ve got a dream since being a child that has been realised but on the other hand, it has been a very difficult weekend and we have lost a friend first of all. It is very difficult in these situations. I would like to dedicate my first win to him, we have grown up together – my first ever race was with Anthoine – and it is just such a shame what happened. I can’t enjoy fully my first victory but I will keep this memory forever.The victorious Charles Leclerc, understandably, cuts an extremely emotional figure up on the podium. After collecting his trophy following his first Formula One win, the national anthems ring out in Spa and cue some muted champagne celebrations. Rest in peace, Anthoine Hubert is very much the message from Leclerc.Charles Leclerc steps out of his Ferrari and points to the sky. And he speaks so, so well, as he dedicates his first career win to Anthoine Hubert. “On one hand, I’ve got a dream since being a child that has been realised but on the other hand, we have lost a friend first of all and it’s very difficult in these situations,” Leclerc says. “I would like to dedicate my first win to him, we have grown up together – my first ever race was with Anthoine – and it is just such a shame what happened yesterday. I can’t enjoy fully my first victory but I will keep this memory forever.”“Yes!” shouts Leclerc down the team radio. “It feels good but it’s difficult to enjoy it on a weekend like this. But thanks for everything guys.” Meanwhile, Alex Albon finishes fifth on his Red Bull debut. Disaster for Lando Norris at the end of the crescendo of that race, as he plummeted down the grid. He was on for a fifth-placed finish but ended up breaking down on the grass.Lap 4444: Giovinazzi crashes out – but he’s absolutely fine. Lap 4444: Here we go! Can Leclerc hold on?Lap 4344: Hamilton is eating away at Leclerc. The Ferrari leads – but his lead is dwindling. Hamilton trails by just 1.6secs ... we’re in for a big finish! Hamilton is not going down without a fight.Lap 4344: Leclerc leads Hamilton by 2.1secs – the Mercedes is going nowhere just yet. He’s hungry and the Ferrari can see Hamilton in his mirrors ...Lap 4244: The back markers are bogging Leclerc down as Hamilton makes light work of clearing the Haas’. Two-and-a-half laps or so to go but a last-lap showdown looks increasingly likely, with Hamilton closing the gap, whittling it down to just 2.3secs. Lap 4144: Lance Stroll nips ahead of Romain Grosjean and into 13th. It’s not over out in front, with the gap closing between Hamilton and Leclerc. Had Vettel not have sapped some of Hamilton’s earlier pace, the Mercedes would surely be on the Frenchman’s tail. Leclerc leads by three seconds ...Lap 4044: Five laps to go!Lap 3944: Leclerc leads Hamilton by 5.9secs.Lap 3744: Twelth-placed Romain Grosjean is told by Haas that he could get in and among the points – but he’s having none of it. He says they have no chance with this pace, bogged down by carrying too much drag. Meanwhile, Albon zooms into seventh after nipping ahead of Daniil Kvyat. Out in front, Hamilton is beginning to run out of laps and is at least trying to turn the screw. Can he?Lap 3644: Vettel’s race has gone to pot. The German, who has not won a race since Spa last year, trails third-placed Bottas by 18secs after going wide. It’s surely a two-horse race for the win, with Leclerc leading Hamilton by 6.6secs.Lap 3544: Albon earns a roaring applause down in the paddock after breezing beyond a sluggish Daniel Ricciardo, whose had had a torrid time. Red Bull do have something to cheer, after all. Verstappen retired on lap one.Lap 3444: Leclerc leads Hamilton by 7.1secs.Lap 3344: Vettel re-pits. He has no intentions of getting into a squabble with Valtteri Bottas but now he has a chance to apply the hammer late on. Leclerc continues to lead Hamilton.Lap 3244: Hamilton pulls ahead of Vettel! Hamilton zooms into second and the Ferrari was powerless to prevent the Mercedes flying past him. Game on: Leclerc v Hamilton, who trails the race leader by 6.3secs. The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff clenches his fist he looks a very happy man back in the paddock. Lap 3144: Mercedes ask Bottas to help out his team-mate Hamilton. “Keep your tyres in good nick” is the message down the team radio. Hamilton must fancy his chances of toppling Vettel, who is wobbling, slowing on the track. They go wheel-to-wheel into turn 19 but Vettel prospers out of La Source.Lap 3044: Hamilton says his “rears are on fire” but Mercedes reassure him that Vettel’s tyres are overheating just as much. Leclerc leads Vettel by 4.8secs, and maybe they will try and keep the German out on track as long as possible to help the race leader open up a bigger lead. Hamilton is 0.4secs behind Vettel.Lap 2944: Vettel is cagey about Ferrari calling him back in. Hamilton’s renewed pace could yet eat up both of the Ferraris. Hamilton’s on the hunt, slowly shaving Vettel’s advantage.Lap 2844: Plan B for Vettel? The Ferrari driver is told his tyres will not last until the end and he’ll have to come in for another set of tyres. That’s good news for Mercedes and Hamilton, who has picked up the pace, as has Bottas.Lap 2744: Vettel is briefed to let Leclerc past him. Ferrari remain in control, with a new-look one-two. Vettel benefits from the DRS and things are looking good. Lap 2644: Bottas sets a slick new fastest lap of 1.46. Lap 2544: Vettel leads Leclerc by 2.1secs. Hamilton trails the Frenchman by 6.7secs. Vettel’s pace has killed Mercedes’ optimism.Lap 2444: Hamilton does not seem too happy about the Mercedes strategy here. He clearly feels they were too slow to react to Ferrari blinking first. Bottas’s stop is quick, which is handy as he comes out in fourth behind his team-mate. Charles Leclerc has just set a new fastest lap. Vettel leads.Lap 2344: Hamilton’s pit-stop is not Mercedes’ finest – it was a little sluggish, with Ferrari yielding a second or so on his car, owing to a problem with the left-rear. Down the team radio, Bottas is told to give it everything he’s got, to put the hammer down ... but then box. How will Mercedes look after this? The mediums are on.Lap 2244: Lewis Hamilton is the new race leader. Leclerc nips out of the pits – and it was a lightning stop – in fourth, behind Sebastian Vettel. The Ferraris are on fresh medium tyres, while Mercedes remain on the softs. And now Hamilton is told to box ...Lap 2144: The top three are yet to pit as we approach the halfway stage. But, hang on a minute, Leclerc is told to box down the team radio. Ferrari get ready to receive. Things are about to hot up ...Lap 2044: Down in 13th, Nico Hülkenberg skips in front of Kevin Magnussen. Kubica is the back marker, Leclerc the race leader.Lap 1944: A fitting standing ovation and a round of applause on lap 19, in tribute to Anthoine Hubert, whose Arden car was the No 19. On the track, Vettel continues to boss things, dictating the pace from fourth as he racks up another fastest lap. Lando Norris, meanwhile, pits. Leclerc leads Hamilton by 4.3secs.Lap 1844: Mercedes are seemingly playing the long game. Hamilton remains out on track, four seconds behind race leader Charles Leclerc. Vettel is ripping it up.Lap 1744: Hamilton soldiers on for another lap. Vettel, on the mediums, is building his pace and passes Norris. The Ferrari is flying round Spa. Romain Grosjean is the latest to pit.Lap 1644: And now Vettel pits – he’s in and out in no time, stopping for just 2.5 secs – and the Ferrari sprints out into fifth, behind Lando Norris. Vettel blinks first, then, while Sergio Pérez soon follows. Leclerc leads Hamilton. Lap 1544: Albon’s Red Bull es down the inside of Kevin Magnussen and he jumps into 10th. Gasly’s pit-stop has triggered more drivers to come in and seek attention, with Lance Stroll the latest to pop in for some fresh tyres.Lap 1344: Leclerc is ramping things up, with the Ferrari racking up a 1.49.917, a new fastest lap. Between Leclerc and Vettel, who now trails the race leader by more than three seconds, they are taking it in turns to step on the gas. Meanwhile, Gasly pits.Lap 1244: Eighteen drivers remain at Spa, with Sainz Jr retiring as a result of power-related problems and Max Verstappen clashing with Räikkönen at La Source on an eventful first lap. “It was a poor start, I don’t really know why,” says Verstappen. “From then onwards, I just braked maybe a little later than the two cars ahead of me and Kimi probably didn’t expect me to be there.”Lap 1144: No investigation necessary is the verdict from the FIA regarding that Leclerc error. The Ferrari leads Vettel by 2.6secs, with Hamilton in third followed by his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas. Then it’s Lando Norris in fifth.Lap 1044: Hamilton says “Vettel’s struggling”. He smells blood in Vettel, who is still a second in front of the Englishman. Still, that is music to the ears of the Mercedes team back at the paddock. Meanwhile, the FIA say they have taken note of a turn 5 incident involving Charles Leclerc, who went off wide a moment ago. The Ferrari is unlikely to be penalised because he gained no advantage. Lap 944: Leclerc is beginning to stretch his legs. The Frenchman leads Sebastian Vettel by 2.2secs. Leclerc was guilty of locking up into a corner a moment ago and Hamilton is having a good go at closing the gap to Vettel out of La Source.Lap 744: Leclerc leads Vettel, who has just set a new fastest lap of 1.49.459, by 1.9secs. Maybe Vettel is not as sluggish as Hamilton is making out. Down in seventh, Kevin Magnussen is doing a sterling job of batting away Pérez, with Gasly still close for company.Lap 644: Magnussen, Sergio Pérez and Pierre Gasly are wrestling for seventh, with the former currently leading that pack. Down the radio, Lewis Hamilton seems pretty chirpy. “Vettel’s not that quick,” says the Mercedes driver. His team concur, admitting the Ferrari’s straight-line speeds are not too impressive.Lap 544: Vettel locks up going into the La Source but gets away with it, although surely the Ferrari has ceded some ground on third-placed Lewis Hamilton. Leclerc is out in front by 1.8secs. Bottas trails Hamilton by around 4secs. A word on Lando Norris, who has climbed up to fifth from 11th after a lightning start.Lap 444: The safety car is still plodding along out in front, followed by Charles Leclerc, Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. Kimi Räikkönen has assumed the role of back marker following that early collision with Verstappen.Lap 344: The safety car remains out on track, with Carlos Sainz Jr down and out having twice stalled. An unhappy 25th birthday for the Spaniard and McLaren. Verstappen’s race is also run, much to the disappointment of hundreds of orange-clad Dutch supporters who have popped over the border. Lap 244: A nightmare start for Max Verstappen, whose race is over before it even began. Räikkönen plunges down the grid, popping into the pits but comes away unscathed. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo has also pitted. There is not a lot of room for manoeuvre and Verstappen is an early victim of a helter-skelter start in Spa. Behind the safety car, Leclerc leads from Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel. It has not been a dull few minutes.Max Verstappen is out of the race and the safety car is deployed. Big audible groans from the home crowd in Spa, gutted at seeing their man bow out following a clash with Kimi Räikkönen. It was a messy start. Down at the front, Charles Leclerc leads Vettel, who is already under the cosh, with Lewis Hamilton breathing down his neck. Great start by Albon, but Sainz Jr stalls on the grid. Three minutes until the off at Spa-Francorchamps! We are a formation lap or so away from the off at the Belgian GP.A gentle reminder that Lewis Hamilton is way out in front in the drivers’ standings, ahead of Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Ferrari remain winless this season but Charles Leclerc starts on pole and the young Monacan is alongside Sebastian Vettel on the front row of the grid. “I didn’t expect to have the year that I’ve had,” Hamilton says. “It’s been absolutely phenomenal and I’ve been enjoying it more than ever.” The F1 family continue to pay tribute to Anthoine Hubert, with the liveries of all of the cars carrying special markers out of respect:A poignant driver’s parade in Spa:There will be a minute’s silence at Spa. It will be in remembrance of Anthoine Hubert, the 22-year-old who was tragically killed in a F2 crash on Saturday. It will take place before the Belgian national anthem that precedes the GP is played out. The FIA is providing support to the event organisers and the relevant authorities, and has commenced an investigation into the incident. First thing’s first: all thoughts with the family and friends of Anthoine Hubert, who was killed in a crash at Spa-Francorchamps on Saturday. The Formula 2 driver died in Liege hospital, where he was taken following a collision at around 170mph with Juan-Manuel Correa, who remains in intensive care following surgery.The mood around Spa will inevitably be sombre as F1 takes centre stage, with Charles Leclerc on pole after beating his Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel in qualifying. Lewis Hamilton begins from third, with Max Verstappen in fourth. But the events that followed qualifying have understandably overshadowed the Belgian Grand Prix weekend. Fernando Alonso said: “I have no words. It hurts the heart. Rest in peace, champ.” In a message posted on Instagram, Hamilton said: “This is devastating. God rest your soul Anthoine. My prayers and thoughts are with you and your family today. If a single one of you watching and enjoying this sport think for a second what we do is safe your hugely mistaken. All these drivers put their life on the line when they hit the track and people need to appreciate that in a serious way because it is not appreciated enough. Not from the fans nor some of the people actually working in the sport. Anthoine is a hero as far as I’m concerned, for taking the risk he did to chase his dreams. I’m so sad that this has happened.

So far, it’s been the very picture of a bucolic idyll. We’ve been in Margaret Hale’s beloved childhood home of Helstone, where the pillars that formed the columns of a stately house in the first scene have the suggestion of trees, which are tall, shady and enveloping. Half a dozen community cast members come on to scatter petals that flutter in the breeze. It is languid, laid-back and carefree, like the sweeter moments of A Midsummer Night’s Dream.That’s when it happens. In an instant, the colour scheme switches from spring green to industrial grey, and the trees on Amanda Stoodley’s set become toxic chimneys billowing smoke over the town of Milton, a stand-in for the Manchester of the industrial revolution. The petals filling the air are now fatal strands of cotton, ready to clog every mill worker’s lungs. The community cast has swollen to fill all corners of the stage, the embodiment of urban overpopulation. You’d think you were in a different play.The contrast gets to the heart of Gaskell’s 1854 novel, a culture-clash drama in which the genteel values of the upper-crust south rub up against the hard-as-nails pragmatism of the working-class north. It’s a clash that adapts electrically to the stage, where the opposing forces battle it out in tense confrontations, neither side wholly right nor wrong. Fighting one corner is minister’s daughter Margaret, whose snobby distaste for those who have to work for a living turns out to be less defining than her natural sense of justice. In the opposite corner is mill owner John Thornton, who – like a 19th-century Sajid Javid – seems to think his rise to riches from a humble background gives him moral authority.Together, they make a double act in the lineage of Beatrice and Benedick, and Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, creating the romantic heart of Janys Chambers’s crisp and theatrical adaptation. Thornton might be an arrogant arriviste with a cruel disregard for his workforce but – played by Harry Long as a man not quite comfortable in his establishment skin – he repeatedly elicits sympathetic sighs from an audience sorry to see him unlucky in love.As Margaret, an exceptionally good Claire Dargo is similarly unsure of her footing, torn between the prudish assumptions of her class and the evidence of exploitation, hunger and degradation she sees before her. Empathetic and quick-witted, she has a bird-like alertness, as if forever checking her own instincts, making her at once bold and questioning. It’s hard to keep your eyes off her, although she has strong support from Wendy Paver’s no-nonsense servant Dixon, Emilie Patry’s stoic Mrs Hale and Deirdre Davis’s unforgiving Mrs Thornton.Margaret and John’s will-they-won’t-they romance gives the play its emotional shape and makes us willing to accept its rather too neat happy ending, but they also exemplify the political forces that spill out into the auditorium in Elizabeth Newman’s expansive production. In our own polarised era of ideological echo chambers, it becomes a story of injustice exacerbated by poor communication. The presence of such large numbers on stage – and occupying the aisles – turns it from a distant story of olden days strife into a living discussion. Rarely has this theatre seemed so much part of the public sphere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b40b1e3087947cfb8e3f1ef3bd4537b45dcf8bd3/0_0_4928_3280/master/4928.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dbf270a0c7552c582700893c4a727d0 880w","title":"matera basilicata italy european capital of culture 2019","story":"After 10,000 years, the ancient city in Basilicata is having a moment: it’s a European capital of culture for 2019 – and even James Bond is making a visit‘This room is called Senza Nidd – without anything – because the people who lived here were so poor,” said the receptionist. Our modest-sized hotel room in Matera, southern Italy, once housed an entire family – not back in the middle ages, but within living memory. Matera, a troglodyte city in Basilicata, was considered “the shame of Italy” in the 1950s because of the extreme poverty and widespread disease in its ancient Sassi districts. The residents were compulsorily relocated and the crumbling city, thought to be possibly the third-oldest in the world after Aleppo and Jericho, lay empty for the first time in 10,000 years.Yet today it is full of tourists keen to visit one of the two 2019 European capitals of culture (the other is Plov, Bulgaria). Investment began trickling in from the late 1980s, and although the families that had been forced out never returned, many of their descendants came back to open hotels and restaurants. Matera got a boost when it became a world heritage site in 1993, and another when it starred as Jerusalem in Mel Gibson’s controversial The Passion of the Christ in 2004. In fact, filmmakers can’t resist it – the 25th Bond movie No Time To Die (released next year) is the latest blockbuster to be filmed here.I was visiting on a new Sassi and Trulli short break with Inntravel to find out what makes Matera so special. It didn’t take long to work out – this city is like nowhere else on Earth. The two Sassi (“stones”) districts, Sasso Caveoso and Sasso Barisano, are built on natural caves that have been excavated and extended over millennia. A warren of pale limestone churches, monasteries, palaces and houses rises above the caves, all balanced on the edge of a ravine. By day, it is breathtaking lit up at dusk, it can bring you to tears.One of Matera’s unmissable sights is its chiese rupestri or rock churches. As well as those in the city, there are another 150 in the Park of the Rock Churches across the Gravina river, which can be reached on a guided tour or by bike (our trip included bike hire). The 12th-century Chiesa San Pietro Barisano is the biggest in the Sassi, its interiors completely carved out of the rock. My macabre partner perched in one of the sinister “draining chairs” in the crypt, where dead priests were once seated until their flesh had decomposed. Other standout rock churches include Santa Maria de Idris and the Convicinio di Sant’Antonio, which sit in a spectacular spot on a rocky spur. The 13th-century cathedral rises above the Sassi, reached via a steep tangle of alleyways.Another top sight is the Palombaro Lungo, a huge manmade water cistern dug into the rock during the 16th century. Its scale and ingenuity are certainly impressive, but it lacks the grandeur of, say, the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. We found a visit to a casa grotta more compelling – a handful of cave houses have been preserved as museums, complete with fixtures, fittings and model livestock. We visited Casa Grotta del Barisano, where a family of seven, plus farm animals, lived without electricity or running water until 1960.As befitting a capital of culture, Matera has several rewarding museums, including the Archaeological Museum, with a collection of 4th- and 5th-century Greek vases, and the Museum of Medieval and Modern Art, which includes work by Carlo Levi, whose 1945 book Christ Stopped at Eboli first alerted the world to the living conditions in this part of southern Italy. Our highlight was Musma, the Museum of Contemporary Sculpture, where cutting-edge sculpture is housed in centuries-old caves below and a 16th-century palace above.Matera has a rich culinary tradition. Restaurants showcase Basilicatan specialities, often called Lucanian cuisine after the region’s ancient name. Grains, pulses and vegetables dominate this cucina povera, with small amounts of meat and cheese. La Focagna, a cosy cave tavern that stays open until 2am, serves simple, affordable dishes. We ate crapiata, a delicious bean soup served with toasted Matera bread, followed by orecchiette with garlicky cime di rapa (a leafy brassica). More upmarket cave restaurants can be found on and around Via Bruno Buozzi, such as the one we chose, Morgan. A selection of starters included mashed fava beans with chicory, and was followed by pappardelle with wild boar sauce. We ordered peperoni cruschi on the side – these sun-dried red peppers from Senise are highly prized – and drank aglianico, Basilicata’s star grape.Café-thronged Piazza del Sedile was our favourite place for an afternoon pitstop I Due Sassi Café does a mean Campari spritz. The city’s main square is Piazza Vittorio Veneto in the 17th-century “new” town. It is the key spot for a passeggiata, and has incredible views over the Sassi skyline. Later in the evening, Mosto Osteria Della Birra is a lively bar for a beer or an amaro lucano, the local digestif. The hippest hangout is Area 8, a cocktail bar with film screenings and live music.Like the restaurants and bars, Matera’s hotels make the most of their unique architecture. We stayed in a simple cave room in Locanda di San Martino, a terraced 40-room hotel in the heart of the Sassi. The thermal baths beneath the hotel, in passages and cisterns carved out of the rock thousands of years ago, are sensational. We also spent a night in Palazzo degli Abati, which has two rooms in caves and three in an 18th-century palace. Our room had two million-year-old fossils in the walls.There may be something a little uncomfortable about tourists thronging to eat and sleep in peasant dwellings. After all, the previous occupants lived in caves and huts out of necessity. On the other hand, it is one way to preserve a piece of history – as well as the memory of the Senza Nidd family, and thousands like them.The trip was provided by Inntravel, which has a Sassi and Trulli self-guided hotel-to-hotel cycling short break from £695pp, including four nights’ B\u0026ampB accommodation, two dinners, cycle hire, route notes and maps, luggage transported between hotels and return taxi fromto Bari airport.

No one was injured, according to a report sent to Trump administration officials and seen by the Associated Press.The woman walked into the office on Friday afternoon and threw a bottle filled with gasoline. A lit fuse disconnected from the bottle and the device did not ignite, according to the report.Law enforcement officials believe the woman intended to cause harm but the incident was not related to other recent instances in which homeland security agencies were targeted.Earlier this month in San Antonio, Texas, at least one vehicle pulled up to a building that houses offices for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, and a gunman fired shots through a window, FBI officials said. No one was injured. Another building used by Ice was also fired on.Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of the agency, which handles legal immigration, said in a tweet the incident was “another example of the use of violence in place of debate by those who oppose the proper application of our immigration laws”.Security officers handcuffed the woman and she was taken into custody by Federal Protective Service officers. Court documents said the incident was captured on video.The woman, Cellicia Hunt, was charged with maliciously attempting to damage or destroy a government building by fire, according to court records. The 35-year-old was expected to appear in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday.She was being held without bail in a local jail on Saturday and it was not immediately clear if she had an attorney.No one was injured, though one person reported feeling ill from the smell of gasoline. The office was closed.The incident came amid federal investigators’ growing concerns about attacks on immigration agencies during a time of heightened emotion and scrutiny, as Donald Trump tries to move ahead with major changes and energize his base by delivering on campaign promises.Cuccinelli, who backs Trump’s hardline immigration policies, has presided over recent changes that have drawn criticism.One could deny green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance. Cuccinelli has also defended changes to a long-standing agreement that governs how children cared for in government custody and how long they can be detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a5b15aec8aac5d9c093a76ccb62805636062bd/0_169_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61d95072bbd81bae210ba3fafdce7c4e","title":"us iranian tanker adrian darya syria","story":"The US has blacklisted the Iranian tanker Adrian Darya, saying it had “reliable information” it was transporting oil to Syria in defiance of wide-ranging sanctions on the regime of Bashar al-Assad.Previously known as Grace 1, the vessel was seized in July by British marines and held in Gibraltar for six weeks, on suspicion it was delivering oil for Tehran’s ally Damascus.The British territory released the ship – despite US protests – after it said it had received written assurances from Iran that the vessel would not head for countries under European Union sanctions. Tehran later denied it had made any promises.“We have reliable information that the tanker is underway and headed to Tartus, Syria,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said in a tweet on Friday.The US Treasury said the vessel was “blocked property” under an anti-terrorist order, and “anyone providing support to the Adrian Darya 1 risks being sanctioned”.The ship’s captain, Akhilesh Kumar, was blacklisted under the order.Since its release from Gibraltar, the Adrian Darya has been bouncing around the Mediterranean, its every move followed. The vessel was in waters north of Cyprus as of early Saturday, according to the MarineTraffic website.Lebanon earlier dismissed Turkish claims that it would receive the ship, which has a cargo of 2.1m barrels worth around $140m.While Iran has denied selling the oil to Damascus, experts said the likely scenario was for a ship-to-ship transfer, with a Syrian port the final destination.Maritime traffic monitors had shown that the Adrian Darya’s latest listed destinations, which are not necessarily the next approved port of call, were in Turkey. After tracking sites showed Mersin as its destination, it then switched to Iskenderun, prompting a reaction from Turkey’s foreign minister.“This tanker is not heading actually to Iskenderun, this tanker is heading to Lebanon,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said in Oslo.Lebanon dismissed that scenario, stressing that it never buys crude oil because it does not have refineries, and adding that it had not received any docking requests from the tanker.Iran said on Monday it had “sold the oil” aboard the tanker and that the owner will decide the destination. It did not identify the buyer or say whether the oil had been sold before or after the tanker’s detention.It also said it could not name the actual destination due to “economic terrorism” by the US and its sanctions on Iran’s oil sales.In July, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard impounded a British-flagged tanker in Gulf waters. Britain called it a tit-for-tat move but Tehran denied any connection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db57454f63647061131def8b296bfc789c1420d/0_230_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=770628b056ea29baef471723ed1ffcb4","title":"afd bids to encirle berlin saxony brandenburg state elections","story":"Crucial elections in two eastern states of Germany could be about to change the political direction of the country, with polls showing the potential of the far right to emerge as the strongest force.Five million Germans are eligible to vote on Sunday in Saxony and Brandenburg in election battles that could have a resounding impact on the federal government in Berlin and have been fuelled by debates on the success and failures of German reunification, with the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall coming this autumn.The anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) faces its first real electoral test in the region. At the last state election, five years ago, the party was just a year old and lacking clout.All parties have ruled out going into coalition with the AfD, meaning that tense negotiations almost certainly lie ahead.Analysts agree that if the AfD tops the polls it will represent the biggest political earthquake for Germany since the end of the cold war, marking the first time a rightwing populist force has taken control in postwar Germany.The size of the AfD’s gains after a campaign focused on appealing to – and amplifying – a collective feeling of abandonment have been most keenly felt in Saxony. There, it is expected to take half or a third of seats from the CDU, which in 2014 secured 59 out of 60 constituencies.Its election slogan “Vollende die Wende”, or “Complete the transition” – stealing the phrase used in 1989 to describe the change from communism to liberal democracy – is an invitation to topple the status quo just as protesters brought about the East German revolution.“The AfD is not the cause of the upset we’re seeing, neither is it iding society,” said Andreas Kalbitz, the AfD’s leading candidate in Brandenburg, fresh from an election rally. “The AfD is the consequence of the failure of others.”Born in Munich, the former paratrooper settled in Brandenburg with his British wife and children more than a decade ago. His contacts with far-right sympathisers have made repeated headlines in Germany in recent months as he positions himself to oust Dietmar Woidke, who has been Brandenburg’s state premier since 2013. Those headlines continued last week when he admitted he had attended a neo-Nazi rally in 2007 in the Greek capital, Athens.Kalbitz insists it is largely western Germans’ lack of empathy towards easterners, and the widespread perception that they plundered the east of its wealth in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of communism, that has fuelled much of the resentment among Brandenburgers.“It has been forgotten in the west,” he said. “But people in the east have not forgotten how people came with their fast cars and closed down the businesses, so as to clear the field of competition for western businesses.”Matthias Platzeck, who was Brandenburg’s premier until 2013, said: “Democracy here is on the precipice of a crisis. People have the overwhelming feeling that, following both the finance and the refugee crises, the state has lost control.“The AfD is exploiting this latent sense of insecurity and has the same explanation for everything: if your bus is late or a train is cancelled, some Iraqi or other must be to blame.”The campaigns – the state of Thuringia follows on 27 October – have thrown the reunification project into sharp relief. Often presented as an unparalleled success story, which has involved an injection of more than 2 trillion euros to fund welfare benefits and infrastructure, the AfD has sought to present it as colonial-style exploitation and failure, pointing to the exodus of 1.9 million people from the former German Democratic Republic since 1990.Taking a stroll through the centre of Potsdam, the prosperous capital of Brandenburg famous for its historic buildings, Günter Koll, a retired engineer, said he believed the false priorities of a string of governments were to blame for the disenchantment.“A succession of governments here has put the emphasis on nice facades and flat roads,” the 71-year-old Potsdam native said, pointing at reconstructed baroque buildings. “That’s all well and good, but I think often they’ve forgotten the actual people. A lot of people are angry and lonely. They don’t feel useful.”He insisted he would not be voting for the AfD, but has neighbours who would. “We’re generally less afraid of political change, as we’ve already experienced enough of it in our lives. It makes it easier for people to switch to the AfD.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e0cda4a4a553d8cfa20406fd9a718a811d95ec/107_152_2320_1392/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b55f0b24e30f6d77f5dd2290f4668ef","title":"channel people smugglers cram 30 into boats for six","story":"Children tell charity workers of being knocked into the water as attempts to reach UK from France increaseSmugglers are cramming up to 30 people on to small boats to cross the Channel from France to the UK, and children have been among those who have recently fallen overboard, campaigners have revealed.As crossing attempts surge at the close of summer amid rumours that Brexit will mean tighter border restrictions, criminal gangs are loading inflatable boats up to five times their capacity. Previously, people smugglers would put about eight passengers on each vessel.Maddy Allen of the charity Help Refugees, which works with more than 1,500 migrants around Calais and Dunkirk, said: “Up to 30 a boat is now commonplace. Boats are overcrowded we’ve had children knocked off the side.“There was a boat last week where four people ended up in the water. It’s often the responsibility of the other people on the boat to drag them out then the boat will usually either make it to the UK or be intercepted and taken back to French territory.”The heightened desperation follows emergency talks in Paris last Thursday between the home secretary, Priti Patel, and her French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, to intensify joint efforts to tackle the Channel crossings. The talks concluded with the government considering increasing the amount it pays France to deal with the issue, prompting critics to say the intervention will simply push people to pursue more dangerous routes.Migrants have been arriving in the UK almost daily over the past week. So far this year more than 1,000 people, including many children, are understood to have entered the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats, compared with fewer than 300 for the whole of 2018.Most attempt the crossing in inflatable boats with outboard motors that can safely carry about six people. Beaches around the seaside village of Wissant, about six miles from Calais, have become a favoured stretch for boats leaving France.“We’re hearing all the same issues associated with the Mediterranean crossings: the boats start to take on water,” said Allen. “Then there’s not having the proper lifejackets.”Rachel Sykes of the charity Project Play, which works with about 300 children in the Grande-Synthe area of Dunkirk, said some minors had been taken to hospital after falling into the sea during failed crossings. She added: “Children often emphasise it’s not a safe thing for them to be doing, which is heartbreaking. That means they’ll be forced to do it again and again.”Charities say the mental health of migrants in northern France is worse than they have ever known, and more serious than seen in the Calais camp destroyed by the French authorities in 2016.Chloé Lorieux, programme coordinator of Doctors of the World UK, part of the Médecins du Monde network, said self-harm, substance abuse and depression are more widespread.Clare Morris, co-founder of Project Play, said: “We don’t know how often each family tries, plus it varies from family to family, but it is frequent. Children will often tell us on consecutive days about what has happened the previous night in relation to crossings.”Meanwhile, police are investigating the death of a woman who fell from a boat in poor weather while crossing the Channel on 9 August. Last Friday off the Belgian coast, police found the body of an Iraqi migrant wearing a homemade lifejacket of empty water bottles, who had drowned while trying to swim to the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c335b880aaf5a03c76559712a58b64c1050afa1/0_32_2932_1759/master/2932.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3401b749990439abbec74757c0a8bc4f","title":"german president asks poland for forgiveness at ww2 ceremony","story":"Frank-Walter Steinmeier makes speech at Warsaw event to mark 80 years since start of warThe German president vowed his country would never forget the atrocities of the Nazi period on Sunday as he asked forgiveness from Poland during a series of commemorative events to mark the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of the second world war.“In no other square in Europe do I find it more difficult to speak, and to address you in my native language of German ... I ask for forgiveness for Germany’s historical guilt and I recognise our enduring responsibility,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at a ceremony in Piłsudski Square in Warsaw.Steinmeier and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, joined a number of heads of state at the ceremony. Other events were held in Wieluń, which was heavily bombarded by the German air force on the first day of the war and Westerplatte, where the first shots of the war were fired when a German battleship opened fire on a Polish garrison in the early hours of 1 September.“It is hard to imagine that cataclysm of history today, the armed conflict which brought the most disastrous consequences in the history of mankind. We have to remember, and therefore we are gathered here today,” the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, said at the Warsaw ceremony.Poland’s nationalist government had hoped that the US president, Donald Trump, would be the guest of honour, but he cancelled at the last minute and sent his vice-president, Mike Pence, in his place.Despite the atmosphere of reconciliation, different politicians drew very different conclusions about the lessons of the war.There was a note of anger in Duda’s speech, as he said Europe should have stood up to the Nazis earlier. “Perhaps the second world war would not have broken out in the first place, if the states in the west had put up a decisive resistance against … the imperial ambitions of Hitler,” he said.By way of comparison, Duda also criticised western leaders who propose rapprochement with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, after Moscow’s actions in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. “Turning a blind eye is not the recipe for preserving peace. It is a simple way to give consent to further attacks,” he said.Putin was present at a similar commemoration 10 years ago, but was not invited this year because of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia’s new revisionist historical policy, which downplays the Nazi-Soviet pact agreed a week before Germany attacked Poland.The Soviet Union, in accordance with a secret protocol of the pact, invaded Poland from the east on 17 September. Putin called the pact a mistake a decade ago, but Russia’s foreign ministry has embarked on a campaign in recent weeks to show it as necessary and even a diplomatic triumph.Pence used his speech to talk as much about Soviet atrocities as Nazi crimes, paying tribute to Polish bravery and quoting the Russian writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. The main problem of the 20th century was that men had forgotten God, he said.The European commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, attended the ceremony in Westerplatte and had a different message. He said the best way to honour the memory of the war dead was by “working for tolerance, working for mutual respect, working to remove the feeding ground of those who propose intolerance”. Timmermans has been a vocal critic of the current Polish government.The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, raised another thorny issue, using his speech at Westerplatte to demand Germany pay reparations for the devastation of Poland during the war.“We have to talk about, remember and demand the truth regarding those losses. We have to demand compensation,” he said. German officials have insisted that the matter is closed and they will not pay reparations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54bd6d0e3c460d2595e233751fad9816d934177/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f86e26b35f09b5bade45eab6a5e09073","title":"pope francis gets stuck lift for 25 minutes vatican","story":" Pontiff apologises for arriving late to St Peter’s Square and says he was freed by firefightersPope Francis has said he got stuck in a lift for 25 minutes at the Vatican and had to be rescued by firefighters.The pontiff apologised to the faithful gathered in St Peter’s Square on Sunday for showing up seven minutes late to his traditional noon appointment with the public.Apparently referring to electric power, Francis said a “drop in tension” caused the problem. He said he was rescued by Holy See firefighters and asked the people in the square to applaud them.In his address he challenged governments to take “drastic measures” to combat global warming and reduce the use of fossil fuels, saying the world was experiencing a climate emergency. Francis issued his appeal, a written message for Sunday’s World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation, ahead of the United Nations Climate Action Summit this month in New York, a follow up to the 2016 Paris Agreement to curb global warming. Calling the UN summit “of particular importance,” he added: “There, governments will have the responsibility of showing the political will to take drastic measures to achieve as quickly as possible zero net greenhouse gas emissions and to limit the average increase in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius with respect to pre-industrial levels, in accordance with the Paris Agreement goals.”The pope also announced that he will elevate 13 Roman Catholic prelates to the rank of cardinal next month, including 10 “cardinal electors” under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in an eventual conclave to choose his successor. They come from countries including Indonesia, Cuba, Luxembourg, Morocco and the Democratic Republic of Congo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9047ee9c25d1d0105531e47a38b9315eca4c4b/0_777_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7da7c79059919778326f7467917cc1bc","title":"statue red army general prague vandals czech capital","story":"Monument has become focus of a row between the Czech capital and its Russian embassyA statue of a second world war Red Army general repeatedly targeted by vandals has been covered with a tarpaulin amid an escalating row between Czech officials and Russia’s embassy in Prague over its status.Authorities in the Czech capital’s Bubeneč district put the imposing monument honouring Marshal Ivan Konev under cover after saying they were no longer prepared to keep cleaning it following repeated paint and graffiti attacks.The move – announced by the mayor of Prague 6 municipality, Ondřej Kolář – has further inflamed passions over the 40-year-old statue, long controversial in the Czech Republic because of Konev’s role as an enforcer of Soviet military power in postwar eastern Europe.Kolář, a member of the pro-EU Top 09 party, said he had been forced to leave Prague after being given police protection, which was put in place on Friday after he received threats by email, social media and text message.“People were calling my office, threatening even my assistants,” he said. “A few have also come personally to the town hall, asking the receptionists where I could be found so they can beat me up.”The Russian embassy denounced his decision on its Facebook page as a “repeated disgrace” and noted that it was “taken on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the start of the worst military conflict in human history”. Konev was twice officially recognised as a hero of the Soviet Union by Stalin.The tarpaulin, supported by a large scaffold frame, was torn off three times after being fitted on Friday. Two men were arrested and charged with damaging the cover after they were observed leaving the scene in the early hours of Saturday morning. Czech media attributed the damage to “activists”, widely believed to be pro-Russian.Temporary fencing has been installed to foil further attempts to rip off the cover. A council spokesman said it would remain at least until 12 September, when the statue’s future will be discussed at a council meeting.At the weekend, a worker re-covered the monument, located on Interbrigády Square – a neighbourhood that also hosts the Czech defence ministry and army headquarters – while opposing groups of activists gathered under the watch of two police officers.Petr Lázňovský, 48, a pro-democracy campaigner waving a large Nato flag, called the controversy an example of the “hybrid warfare” he said Russia was waging on the Czech Republic.“The crucial point for me is that the Russian embassy, in its Facebook post, claimed it had received letters from Czech citizens wondering which side in the second world war would the Prague 6 mayor have preferred to have won,” he said. “They are implying that Mayor Kolář is pro-Nazi. This is unacceptable for me.”The statue, which is owned by the Czech state, was commissioned during the cold war by the communist regime that then ruled the former Czechoslovakia, in recognition of Konev’s supposed feat in liberating Prague from Nazi occupation in 1945 – an assertion dismissed by historians, who argue the city was already free when his forces arrived.Kolář insisted he did not dispute that Soviet forces “had liberated a great part of Czechoslovakia” and added: “We are grateful to those men in arms who sacrificed their lives for our freedom.”Russia reacted angrily last year after the council amended the original plaque and added others citing Konev’s lesser-known role in more notorious episodes – namely the suppression of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the building of the Berlin Wall, and the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring.Last month, the statue was defaced with red paint as Czechs marked the invasion’s 51st anniversary, prompting Kolář to say the council would not repair the damage.The mayor has previously offered to give the statue to the embassy so it can be displayed on its grounds."},{"url":null,"title":"climate change ireland plans to plant 440m trees by 2040","story":"Twenty-two million trees are to be planted every year in Ireland over the next two decades as part of a plan to tackle climate change, the Government has said. While the Government’s climate action plan, published in June, proposed 8,000 hectares – or 19,768 acres – of new forestry every year in a bid to capture carbon emissions, it did not specify the number of trees involved. In its latest calculations, it suggests this will involve 2,500 conifers or 3,300 broad-leaf trees for every hectare planted. The target is for 70 per cent conifers and 30 per cent broad leaves. “The climate action plan commits to delivering an expansion of forestry planting and soil management to ensure that carbon abatement from land-use is delivered over the period 2021 to 2030 and in the years beyond,” a Department of Communications Climate Action and Environment spokeswoman said. “The plan sets out key actions to be taken by the Department of Agriculture. “The target for new forestation is approximately 22 million trees per year. Over the next 20 years, the target is to plant 440 million.”The ambitious plan would mean a significant shift in the use of farming land in Ireland. The climate action report acknowledges a lack of enthusiasm among the farming community for forestry. A key part of the plan will be to persuade farmers to designate some of their holdings for tree-planting in the future.Government-organised town-hall-style meetings are being held throughout the country to encourage communities to support the targets.Also proposed under the plan, is a massive increase of electric vehicles (EVs), up by an average of 100,000 annually over the next decade, to reach almost one million EVs by 2030.Some 50,000 homes will need to undergo deep retrofits each year to meet the the plan’s targets."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4004057.1567352816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uup suggests proposals to replace irish backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t(From left)  Lord Empey, Robin Swann and Steve Aiken of the Ulster Unionist Party outside Stormont Parliment buildings.

Lord (Reg) Empey has also proposed as an alternative to the backstop that the British government would indemnify the European Union against single market infractions.He further proposed the creation of a new offence in British law for knowingly transporting non-compliant goods to the EU. Lord Empey said he was putting forward the proposals in good faith in a bid to break the stalemate over the backstop. He told the Press Association that the proposals represented an “Irish solution to an Irish problem”.“What we are trying to do is to stimulate a debate. We need a solution. The roaring and shouting that has accompanied Boris Johnson’s activities in the last period doesn’t remove the need for a deal and it doesn’t remove the need for a solution to the problem,” he said.“What we have been told by Dublin and Brussels is that they need an insurance policy to protect their single market. We accept that,” said Lord Empey “So what we are saying is the United Kingdom would make it an offence for its territory to be used to subvert the single market by sending goods through the UK to the single market knowing they were not compliant with single market rules, so people could be prosecuted as a result of that.” Lord Empey said a new North-South body, an addition to the six created under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, could be created to regulate and monitor trade across the Border.He said the proposed new body also would educate and advise companies of any ergence between the UK and EU markets and inspect depots and other business premises to ensure compliance.

I bow my head before the Polish victims of Germany\u0027s tyranny. And I ask forgiveness,” President Steinmeier said, speaking in both German and Polish.“Here began the trail of violence and destruction which was to go through Poland and Europe for six years. We call it war, because we are at a loss to express the horror of those years.”The ceremony, which was also attended by President Andrzej Duda of Poland, was held at 4.37am, exactly 80 years after the air strikes that started the Second World War.Mr Steinmeier was speaking in a long tradition of postwar German leaders who have accepted the country’s responsibility for the crimes of the Nazis.His actions echoed those of Willy Brandt, the former West German chancellor, who famously fell to his knees while visiting a memorial to the dead of the Warsaw ghetto uprising in 1970 - a  moment widely seen as reopening the way to friendly relations.The German and Polish presidents stood side by side at the ceremonySunday’s ceremony did not only address the past. Mr Steinmeier spoke out against attempts to relativise the crimes of the Nazis or German responsibility for them in a barely veiled attack on the nationalist Alternative for Germany party (AfD).“It was the Germans who committed a crime against humanity in Poland. Anyone who claims that this is all in the past, that the National Socialists\u0027 reign of terror over Europe was a marginal event in German history, casts judgment on himself,” he said.Although Mr Steinmeier did not mention the AfD by name, his comments were a clear reference to the party, whose leader Alexander Gauland last year described the Nazi era as “a speck of birds*** in 1,000 years of glorious German history”.Although the German and Polish presidents stood united at Sunday’s ceremony, there are growing isions between the two countries, not least over Poland’s demand for reparations for the Second World War.Mr Steinemeier addressed those demands, saying: “We can not undo the injustice and the suffering. And we cannot quantify the cost.”A Polish parliamentary commission is still determining a sum to demand in reparations, but initial estimates spoke of as much as €740bn (£670bn).Germany has refused to pay reparations, arguing that the issue was finally settled by the 1990 international treaty on German reunification, which was signed by Britain and the other major wartime Allied powers.Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds  to move rescued Jack Russell puppy into Downing StreetTravellers in caravans set up camp on protected Hove Lawns, as businesses complain of slow police and council responseMore than 100 killed after Saudi-led airstrike in YemenCeasefire in Syria at risk of collapse after US airstrike Pope Francis trapped in Vatican elevator for 25 minutes Hong Kong protesters clash with police in airport and shut down roads as calls grow for British protectionRemote-control rescue: Beach patrol in Brighton trials new gadget to save stranded swimmersIsrael fires across border after anti-tank missiles launched from LebanonComment: Brexiteers must bring down John Bercow before he launches his most ruthless plot yet Italian PM raises hopes of coalition government by end of the weekHurricane Dorian upgraded to maximum Category 5 storm as it bears down on BahamasFive Parisian schools delay reopening due to lead from Notre-Dame fire Rare court martial after investigation of Rohingya mass graves Protesters block roads near Hong Kong airport after night of violenceWatch violent clashes erupt between Hong Kong police and protesters at metro stationDuke of Sussex \u0026#39can\u0026#39t wait\u0026#39 to introduce Duchess and Archie to \u0026#39second home\u0026#39 South Africa on official tourDelays for UK passengers returning home from holiday due to French air traffic control failure Comment: Antibiotics could kill us before climate change, so why is the world failing to act?Comment: To thrive after Brexit, we must turbo-charge forgotten corners of the country   We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/01/TELEMMGLPICT000208004972_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqga42_THGIELLKUPUcOUPmoL1tQj75b48tHAVCo84Z7U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hurricane dorian upgraded maximum category 5 storm bears bahamas","story":"Hurricane Dorian is bearing down on the BahamasHurricane Dorian, which is bearing down on the Bahamas, has been upgraded to a Category Five storm.According to the latest projections it is due to hit the Abaco Islands at Grand Bahama on Sunday evening, threatening the homes of 73,000 people.With winds expected to reach 160 mph Hubert Minnis, the Bahamanian Prime Minister, appealed to tourists and residents to head for shelters.If you wait until tonight, it will be too late, he said.

But, he tells Andy Martin, he’s proud of building an ‘unknown little British tech company’ that can take on the likes of giants like AppleClick to followThe IndependentJohn Shermer, the founder of Lightwave, had some of his best ideas in borstal. He was teaching delinquent teenagers in Birmingham back in the 1980s. “I used to think software was some kind of lingerie,” he says.Then he discovered the Acorn BBC Micro. “There was this kid, aged 16, put away for a double murder. He couldn’t read or write. He’d pick a fight rather than answer a question. But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed – for the better.”If he got it wrong, he could start again. “He could fail without humiliation,” says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn’t judgemental.Which is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as “Tech4Good”, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.There was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. “The tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available,” he says.And everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost £150 each and he could only make a few hundred.The idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and\u0026nbspmake more units – for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. “The\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspwas spending millions but I didn’t think they were spending it wisely,” he explains, adding: “My wife was appalled when I quit.” But he got the price down to £10 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time.\u0026nbspNow 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexic\u0026nbsp(as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as “liberating people”.He was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.Even if they couldn’t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. “We changed the lives of thousands of people,” he says. “You had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people’s lives depended on it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won’t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.” Lightwave, however, uses a dedicated radio protocol.The emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. “It’s democratising,” he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012,\u0026nbspLightwave produced a pioneering “gateway” device for a house. “We made all the mistakes,” he says, “but now it works.”Lightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers.\u0026nbspThey design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it’s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps\u0026nbspin some ways. “I can’t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I can’t code either, but I do have the ideas.” He carries a “daybook” around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.Shermer says that Alexa and other virtual assistants have also made a big difference on the domestic front. Fifty per cent\u0026nbspof all commands are now sent via voice. His own mother is 87. “She can’t use a computer but she can still talk to Alexa,” he says.Shermer is proud of being “an unknown little British tech company” up against the giants of the industry. “They’re still getting it wrong,” he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn’t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. “We’re dealing with people’s lives,” he said. “It has to work.” Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.How two childhood friends became sports-pub matchmakers‘Don’t be afraid of AI’: Daniel Pitchford debunks technology mythsHow Daniel Nivern created an international recruitment agency in ChinaWhether you have dementia or you’re easily distracted, it’s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on.\u0026nbsp “We don’t make gadgets,” Shermer says dismissively. “We make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that’s permanent and increases the value of your home.” Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies such as\u0026nbspHoneywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.Shermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. “But we stand our corner,” he says.

He would take a minute to say ‘I agree’. And it was an American voice system.

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

A dream come true, says David Barnett, but it won’t be an easy taskClick to followThe IndependentAt a time when comic book movies rule the box office, it makes sense that one of the most beloved series in recent years gets an adaptation, courtesy of Netflix.When it’s a comic that was written by Neil Gaiman, the man behind book-to-TV hits American Gods and (co-authored with Terry Pratchett) Good Omens, it seems even more of a no-brainer.But while the comic in question, Sandman, holds a special place in the hearts of readers of both the hardcore geek variety and those who would never class themselves as comic nerds, its journey to the screen has been a troubled one and for many years the series was dismissed as simply unfilmable.When DC Comics published the first issue of The Sandman, with a cover date of January 1989, the industry was in the throes of a revolution.Titles such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight\u0026nbspReturns\u0026nbspheralded a new direction.\u0026nbspIt was proclaimed “Comics aren’t for kids any more!” as the superhero genre became grittier and darker, drenched in sex and violence that was much more than a sock on\u0026nbspthe jaw and a KA-POW!\u0026nbspSound effect.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.DC Comics, once the home of corny, brightly-coloured heroes such as Plastic Man and Arm-Fall-Off-Boy (no… really.\u0026nbspHe could take his arm off and hit people with it), was getting cool again. And that was largely thanks to a concerted effort\u0026nbspto bring in British writers and artists to overhaul some of their tired old plotlines and dream up brand new characters.tired tropes\u0026nbsp(DC Comics)A little before Sandman was published, DC brought out a comic called Hellblazer, featuring a British, street-level occultist called John Constantine who smoked and drank and screwed people over. Written by Jamie Delano, with art by John Ridgway, it set the tone for what was to come. In late 1988, DC started running ads for Sandman in the back of its comics. They showed a twinkle-eyed, pale-faced figure and the slogan, “I will show you terror in a handful of dust”.\u0026nbspIt was written by Neil Gaiman, with art initially by Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg and covers by Dave McKean. The advertising blurb was a slight mangling of a quote from TS Eliot’s “The Waste Land”. Gaiman was a name that no one outside of comics would have recognised at that point he’d been brought over to work for DC by forward-thinking editor Karen Berger after a smattering of comics work, including a graphic novel with the aforementioned McKean called Violent Cases. Sandman was published in the same format as the usual DC superhero comics, and billed as a “horror-edged fantasy”.Neil Gaiman: ‘I made Good Omens for Terry Pratchett’Sandman certainly wasn’t about superheroes, though they sometimes featured in slightly grotesque ways. It wasn’t really a horror comic, though it was often horrific. It was fantastical rather than the epic fantasy of the doorstep-sized novels that filled the bookstores. If it wasn’t these things, then what was Sandman all about?The clever answer is that it’s about everything. In 75 monthly issues, from 1988 to 1996, Sandman covered every conceivable topic, from myth and legend to love and loss to identity politics to horror to birth and death to cats that hunt humans and dogs that talk. In a narrower sense, it’s about the Sandman, also known as\u0026nbspMorpheus\u0026nbspor Dream, one of a group of immortal siblings known as the Endless who rule over realms that correspond to, really, the components of the human heart. Alongside Dream, the roll call\u0026nbspincludes Destiny, Despair, Delirium, Destruction, Desire and, of course, Death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He rules over his domain where humans visit, fleetingly, as their bodies rest. He’s actually – whisper it – a bit boring. He doesn’t have much of a sense of humour, isn’t given to snappy rejoinders, and is often brooding over something, some lost love or threat to his realm. So it’s a good job that The Sandman comics are not really very often about him. They’re about the humans who interact with him, and their stories, their lives, which Dream sometimes just witnesses, and sometimes intervenes in.30th anniversary of the first issue\u0026nbsp(DC ComicsVertigo)Though Sandman is a narrative that covers much territory, not always in linear fashion, there is a silver thread running through all 75 issues (later collected into omnibus editions for easier reading) which begins with our introduction to Morpheus,\u0026nbspimprisoned for decades by an opportunistic Aleister Crowley-like English occultist. When he’s finally free, the Lord of Dreams returns to his realm to find it crumbling and in disarray, and sets out to retrieve his objects of power, fix things up, and make right all the chaos that has occurred in his absence.Gaiman was pretty much\u0026nbspunknown when he started writing Sandman (Getty)In early issues, he has to track down the denizens of his domain who have escaped while he’s been gone, and travel to hell to free a lover he wronged thousands of years previously. He meets Shakespeare and gods\u0026nbspand ordinary people thrust into ordinary situations. The series ends with his death but like everything that went before, nothing is as it seems in the land of dreams.The series was an instant hit. It was the comic for people who didn’t read comics, and the comic for those that did. Gaiman must have cast some bewitching hex, because he managed to build a fanbase that was full of cool people and outsiders and comic nerds and punks and pretty much everybody. Everybody loved Sandman. The singer-songwriter Tori Amos loved Sandman. The great American man of letters Norman Mailer called Sandman “a comic strip for intellectuals”. Charles Shaar Murray, the music journalist and author, writing in this very newspaper in 1997, on the release of the final volume of the collected Sandman story, called it “a major achievement. There is nothing quite like it anywhere else.”A plethora of artists have illustrated the Sandman comics. They include Colleen Doran, Jill Thompson, Bryan Talbot, Mark Buckingham, Malcolm Jones III, Charles Vess, Kelley Jones, Matt Wagner, P Craig Russell, and more. All have brought their own touch to Dream and the Endless, but of course the one constant has always been writer Neil Gaiman.In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale\u0026nbsp… And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hardGaiman was pretty much an unknown when he started writing Sandman. He wasn’t even that well known a year or so later when he published, along with Terry Pratchett, the novel Good Omens. By the year 2001, when his first proper solo novel, American Gods, was out, he was a little better known, enough to be interviewed by CNN. He demurred at the suggestions that he was now famous, commenting:\u0026nbsp“I’m not and never will be a John Grisham.”Still, he had his fanbase by then, and it was quite a wide-ranging one. He is quoted in the same interview as describing his market as “a handful of beautiful goths and a handful of boys in dresses and a handful of sci-fi fans and a handful of nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal and the people who look like somebody’s mum. I exist at the intersection of a dozen Venn diagrams.”Now, though, it could be argued that Gaiman has certainly achieved Grisham-esque levels of literary fame, certainly since his 2013 novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane took up residence at the top of the bestseller lists. From then on,\u0026nbspGaiman\u0026nbspbecame a hot property.His works Stardust and Coraline have been adapted into movies, but it wasn’t until the rise of the big-budget, ambitious TV series, heralded by the likes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, that his oeuvre found its natural home. American Gods and Good Omens have both been adapted for TV on Amazon Prime, and Sandman is next, snapped up by Netflix earlier this month.It’s not quite a case of a goldrush to mine Gaiman’s back catalogue for new hits though. For starters, unlike most of his other work, Sandman isn’t Gaiman’s copyright he did the work for DC comics, and the characters he wrote and created belong to them. DC certainly hasn’t been resting on its laurels with turning its intellectual property into TV shows… series such as Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, Titans\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDoom Patrol have been big hits. Shows that are more thematically aligned to Sandman, such as Constantine, based on the comic Hellblazer, appeared, while another adaptation at the darker end of the DC universe, Swamp Thing, has just debuted.Tennant and Michael Sheen in ‘Good Omens’, which Gaiman co-wrote with Terry Pratchett\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp(BBCAmazon)People have been trying to get Sandman on to the screen for almost as long as the comic has been produced. From the late 1990s, Warner Bros, which owns DC Comics, had been trying to get a Sandman movie made. Roger Avary, who worked alongside Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, was slated to direct, but fell out with the company and it never happened. New attempts were made one screenplay sent to Gaiman is said to have evoked the response from him that it was “not only the worst Sandman script I’ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I’ve ever read”.By 2013, when Sandman had been in and out of development hell more often than the character had been in actual hell (which was quite frequently the TV series Lucifer, starring Tom Ellis, is essentially a spin-off series of Sandman, featuring the version of Satan that Gaiman created for the comic), something more concrete appeared to be on the cards. Producer David S Goyer announced that he would be leading a film adaptation, working with actor and filmmaker Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gaiman, with British screenwriter Jack Thorne on script duties.spinoff featuring Satan from ‘Sandman’ and his adventures on Earth (Fox)It underwent several rewrites and by 2016 Gordon-Levitt dropped out of the project, citing differences with the studio over how he thought the direction of the movie should go. The adaptation petered out, with the general feeling that the scope and breadth of Sandman was just too ambitious to be contained in the movie format.Good Omens review: Pratchett \u0026amp Gaiman’s whimsical book brought to lifeEnter, not Sandman, but Netflix. On 30 June\u0026nbspit was announced in Hollywood Reporter that the adaptation was back on, only as an ongoing series on the streaming TV provider, not as a movie. Which is pretty much the best result for a story of this size. David Goyer is back on board, as is Gaiman, whose stock in the TV world has massively risen since the adaptations of Good Omens and American Gods, which he\u0026nbspexecutively produced.One possible question mark people might have over the adaptation is whether the Sandman story has any relevance in 2019, more than 20 years after the main series ended (there have been many spinoffs, and DC recently launched a Sandman Universe\u0026nbspof titles featuring the characters, overseen by Gaiman but created by a new team of comic writers and artists). Good Omens is of a similar vintage to Sandman, but its apocalyptic themes were frighteningly recognisable in this year’s Amazon Prime adaptation, and American Gods was brought up to date nicely with its story of the old gods fading as faith in them wanes, and the new gods of technology, money and sex on the rise.Starz’s ‘American Gods’, Gaiman’s first solo novel\u0026nbsp(Starz)In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale. It’s character-driven rather than plot-heavy, which suits the Netflix model of delving into characters’ backstories and fleshing out the source material it adapts. And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hard. And dreams are not merely the stories we tell ourselves in our sleep they can be hopes and ambitions and wishes for ourselves and others. Perhaps there’s something to be said, also, about how willingly we submit to non-real states, especially online, which wasn’t a real consideration when Gaiman first wrote the series.Overall, Netflix certainly seems a safe pair of hands, and if anyone can do justice to the sprawling story of Dream and the Endless, then this old comics fan thinks it’ll probably be them. Another misgiving aficionados of the comics might have is that over its 75 issues, The\u0026nbspSandman didn’t really plough the sort of neat, linear furrow that TV series like to follow. Sandman is about everything, and that’s sometimes a big ask for a TV show to take on… and which led to the general opinion that it was simply not a thing you could adapt.It’s also a truth that great comics – or novels, for that matter – don’t necessarily make great TV shows or movies. To revisit an earlier point, a comic book isn’t just illustrated fiction. It’s a collaborative medium, it’s its own way of telling stories. It’s writing and art that come together to make a way of communicating a narrative that is different from anything else. Sometimes, that story is best suited to the form in which it was first birthed. And even if it all goes wrong, at least we still have the comics.But people are undeniably excited about a Sandman TV show. The beautiful goths, boys in dresses, sci-fi fans, nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal who were Gaiman’s turn of the millennium fanbase. As will, finally, thanks to Gaiman rapidly becoming a household name, “the people who look like somebody’s mom”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is not mentioned when the smartphone will come to Europe, though it will likely be around the same time as the US.A spokesperson for Samsung refused to confirm further details when contacted by\u0026nbspThe Independent.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldThe Galaxy Fold marks a major departure from the slab-like design of smartphones that has become standard over the last decade.Other smartphone makers have been developing foldable phones, including the world\u0027s second largest smartphone maker Huawei.\u0026nbspThe Chinese manufacturer was also forced to delay the launch of the Mate Flex due to similar concerns about its design.One of the main issues with the new design is with the integrated hinge and flexible screen that needs to survive thousands of folds within the typical life  of a phone without showing signs of wear.In order to address these issues, Samsung said in July that it had added additional reinforcements to the top and bottom of the hinge area, as well as extending a protective layer placed over the screen.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So they go to wealthy people so they can have a holiday boat, only used for a couple of weeks a year,” Mr Holder said.“This is gentrifying the canal and destroying our community.”CTR spokesman Matthew Symonds says the body revoked 17 licences last year and only does so as a last resort when owners fail to comply with its guidelines.Canal and River Trust\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So often are locals now being asked a single repeated question – “where’s the dam?” – there are proposals to create special signage pointing day-trippers in the right direction.The Chernobyl effect is what some are calling it – although, says Martin Thomas, chair of Whaley Bridge Town Council, “obviously there’s no danger of radiation here.”Created with Sketch.

The town is at threat from the dam wall collapse at the nearby Toddbrook ReservoirOn a sunny day, it is easy to see why the flood (no pun intended) of visitors are arriving.The place - population 6,000 - is as picturesque as any of its more famed Peak District neighbours, Buxton, Bakewell and Edale included. There are good pubs, quaint cafes, independent shops and art galleries - as well as all-important chippy - dotting the higgledy-piggledy streets. Both the Peak Forest Canal and River Goyt run through the valley. The walking on the hills offers unrivalled views.“It’s always been a lovely place,” Cllr Thomas, who has lived here 35 years, tells The Independent. “But perhaps it’s been a bit of a secret. The difference now is that it suddenly has a national profile. People have seen it is on the news, and they’ve come along to have a look for themselves.”Whaley Bridge residents gather at evacuation centre after dam collapseVisitors are intrigued by what happened, too, the 65-year-old reckons. Many ask about those seven August days when emergency workers, engineers and a now famous RAF Chinook helicopter worked around the clock to secure the failing Toddbrook Reservoir. Plenty walk through Memorial Park to see the towering 188-year-old dam itself.“As a story, it has everything,” says Cllr Thomas. “Near disaster, heroism and a community pulling together. No-one’s saying visitors come just to look at the dam – although it is impressive – but, if they’re looking to spend a day in the Peak District, they are now considering Whaley Bridge in a way they didn’t before.”Certainly, there is much evidence to support the claim.The not-for-profit Footsteps community café in Market Street - which Cllr Thomas is a director of - has taken more than £2,000 since it reopened on 8 August following the end of the evacuation. In the same period last year, that figure was just £804. A display in its window showing pictures of the dam and the rescue effort, meanwhile, has proven so popular the photographer has turned the images into a commemorative book. An initial run of 75 sold out within days. More than 400 have since been bought.People like the helicopter pictures, shruggs manager Anne Leyland, 77, when I ask about the book\u0027s popularity. They want to remember how it looked, up there in the sky.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They say they want to help by spending their money here, which is such a moving gesture.”Fiona, a mother-of-two who has lived here two years, had her parents visit from their native Dorset not long after the near collapse. “One of the first things my dad asked was to see the dam,” she says.Little Fika, itself, has doubled its takings in August compared to July – although it did lose nearly £500 of fresh food during the evacuation.Nearby at Jarva Gallery in Market Street, owner Lyndsey Selley doesn’t have sales figures but reckons footfall in her art and jewellery store is massively up over the last three weeks.Whaley Bridge residents allowed to return home after evacuationResidents \u0027increasingly fed up\u0027 as handful are allowed to return homeWhaley Bridge residents criticised for ‘putting lives at risk’Whaley Bridge residents refuse to evacuate despite flood riskWhaley Bridge villagers may not be allowed home for six more daysEngineers race against time to stop dam bursting over Whaley BridgeIt seems, I suggest, like a little disaster might be a good idea every summer?“I don’t think our nerves could stand it,” she laughs. “But, as a business community, the challenge now is to build on what’s happened and make sure we take advantage of the raised profile.”A meeting with just this end in mind took place last week between local traders, High Peak Borough Council, Derbyshire County Council and Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire.The decisions taken have been criticised as a little lightweight – an online video is to be made and, if funding can be found, new signs installed and old ones improved – but Lindsay Rae, deputy director of Marketing Peak District and Derbyshire, reckons the benefits can be long-term.“We now have to work hard to capitalise by making sure every visitor here leaves with the best possible impression so they go away and tell their friends, who then also visit,” she says. “There’s no reason this can’t be self-perpetuating.”Certainly, that’s also the hope of John Wakeham, owner of Springbank Guest House in Reservoir Road.Toddbrook Reservoir was damaged in heavy rainfall (PA)He says he’s had cancellations from holiday-makers now apparently apprehensive about staying in a town which sits under a vast 19th century reservoir – but that such drop-outs have been matched by last-minute bookings from visitors who, it seems, do want to stay in exactly such a place.“It’s been a six and two-three’s for us,“ he says. “No business wants cancellations but they’ve mainly been evened out by the new guests. We can’t complain. I suppose the whole things has made Whaley unique.”Not everyone has benefited, it should be said.The week-long closure forced by the evacuation inevitably meant lost money, while house prices are understood to have fallen in the aftermath. Several sales have collapsed.There is some anger, too, at the Canal and River Trust, which manages the reservoir. Residents are asking why inspections did not reveal potential issues with the dam – a question currently being addressed, the trust says, in an independent inquiry.The reservoir itself, meanwhile, will stay shut for an estimated three years while the wall is fixed at a cost which could run into tens of millions of pounds.But for now, back at Footsteps cafe, Cllr Thomas remains sure the long-term positives of the collapse will outweigh the negatives.“I’ve walked through the place the last few week and the shops are bursting at the seems, the sun is shining, the community is out spending money with each other,” he said. “It’s been wonderful to see. Whatever happens now, it’s been a summer no-one will forget.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Though the government has ruled out even a technical extension during talks in Brussels, one option open to\u0026nbspthe opposition is to use legislation to force the prime minister to ask for a delay.\u0026nbspSo how likely would EU leaders be to grant an extension?\u0026nbspThis is uncertain: it can only be decided by the EU’s 27 remaining leaders. The last time Article 50 was extended to set the current deadline, the debate went well into the night and leaders had different views.But we do have a few clues...Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator heads to Brussels for talksJeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders agree no-deal planTwo in five remainers ‘would be upset if child married leave voter’Last time, EU officials said the bloc would only agree to provide time for an extension for the UK to hold a general election, to hold a second referendum, or for a political process to work out a position that parliament could accept.It was the last of these options –\u0026nbspwhich came in the form of the indicative votes in parliament –\u0026nbspthat appeared to carry the day. These were ultimately inconclusive.Would EU leaders grant one again? Probably not for a similarly nebulous political process.\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, since said that he would support an extension for either a referendum or general election. That’s a narrowing of the three options presented last time.“There’s very much a strong view across the European Union that there shouldn’t be any more extensions. While I have endless patience, some of my colleagues, quite frankly, have lost patience with the UK – and there’s enormous hostility to any further extension,” Mr Varadkar told reporters on the doorstep of a summit in June.“So I think an extension could really only happen if it were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK, or even something like a second referendum, if they decided to have one. What won’t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes. The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar is one of the most pro-extension leaders. Perhaps he’s bluffing, but it certainly seems unlikely that EU leaders would refuse to give the UK more time to carry out either of those things.But one problem is that the opposition MPs who want to stop a no deal with legislation –\u0026nbsprather than a vote of no confidence to bring down the government –\u0026nbspwould not necessarily be triggering an election.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

Emmanuel Macron last time argued strongly against a long extension and officials said that while most leaders supported one at the time, next time things might be a little bit different. Varadkar of course\u0026nbspsaid EU leaders are losing patience with the UK – and that was months ago.In summary, an extension would be granted merely to avoid no deal would be far from certain. There is an undeniably correct recognition in some EU capitals that this simply kicks the can down the road. If that bid to stop no deal came with an election or referendum, however, they would be more likely to approve a further delay.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Marquez had led Farc’s negotiating team with Mr Santrich also at the table.Now, just three years on, they were dressed in green coveralls and armed with automatic rifles in what appeared to be a new jungle camp somewhere in the Amazon rainforest.The country’s peace process has already faced significant setbacks and is fiercely\u0026nbspopposed by many, but the declaration is perhaps its biggest test yet.Analysts say it could go one of two ways: provide a much-needed strengthening of a fragile peace process, or jeopardise it, sending the country hurtling back towards war.Marquez (holding a document) and fugitive rebel colleague, Jesus Santrich (in sunglasses),\u0026nbspannounce\u0026nbspthey are taking up arms again\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)In the video, Mr\u0026nbspMarquez, flanked by 20\u0026nbsparmed men, snapped back into his former Marxist rhetoric as if he had never flirted with civilian life.“This is the continuation of the rebel fight in answer to the betrayal of the state of the Havana peace accords,” he said in a 32-minute video in which he blamed the government for not having kept its end of the peace deal.“We were never beaten or defeated ideologically, so the struggle continues.”International proxy war played out in concerts on Venezuela borderThe deal was internationally lauded for formally ending a 52-year war which killed over 260,000 and displaced 7 million as the Farc, paramilitaries and the national army fought each other bitterly for control of territory.But the agreement\u0026nbsphas been fraught with setbacks.Social leaders voicing their support of the accord are being killed at a shocking rate – 627 seven local activists since the deal was signed, according to local NGO Indepaz.The pledges the government made to develop neglected regions of the country remain little more than pledges, encouraging dissident rebels to abandon the process and return to warfare.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He wants to\u0026nbspcreate a new unit dedicated to pursuing them, and offered a reward of £725,000 for the head of each commander who appeared in the video.But although Duque reiterated support for the peace process,\u0026nbspthe majority of his party would like to see it torn up.This gifts them an opportune moment to return the country to war, said Sandra\u0026nbspBorda, political analyst and associate professor at Los Andes University in Bogotá.“This could be a strong wake-up call to the government… does it want its main achievement to be having ended the prospect of peace?” she said.“If they don’t commit to it, if they don’t realise the best response is committing to peace process, the potential that this becomes the beginning another conflict is very high.’’She added: “I am not optimistic at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Burr, who was white, served as America’s third vice president, but is best known for shooting dead founding father Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel, an episode memorialised in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s astonishingly successful musical.On a sunny day last weekend, 215 years after her ancestor killed Hamilton, and 12 months after the Aaron Burr Society formally acknowledged Burr had fathered two children with a woman of colour who worked as his servant, she\u0026nbspwas among 60 people who gathered in Philadelphia to unveil a headstone for John Pierre Burr – one of at least two children the vice president fathered outside of his marriage.“It was a beautiful day,” says Burr, professor of law at the University of New Mexico and author of Complicated Lives: Free Blacks in Virginia, 1619-1865.“We had a pastor who blessed the headstone. I was happy, because John Pierre was a champion for justice and the underground railroad.”Created with Sketch.Modern Slavery in the UK Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation.

When Kamala Harris, an African American senator from California who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, cautiously voiced support for studying whether there ought to be reparations for slavery – “We had more than 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalised discrimination, segregation. We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing” – she faced a major backlash.These conversations come at a fraught time for the nation. Donald Trump may\u0026nbspor may not be\u0026nbspmore racist than\u0026nbspsome of those who preceded him in the Oval Office, but he is more prepared to use racist language openly. The imprimatur of those words as commander-in-chief, allied to the massive power of social media, has emboldened many who share his views, but who may not previously have voiced then aloud.“In the past we had coded language. Now it is more direct,” says Cassandra Newby-Alexander, professor of history at Norfolk State University, located 50 miles from Jamestown, where the English warship White Lion unloaded its human cargo. “There is a step-by-step process to embolden this racism, but I think it may only work for one-third of people. There are more white people unhappy with this level of hate speech.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA fundamental reason for America’s refusal to acknowledge its past – not alone among nations – says writer Rachel Swarns, is that it is “hard history”. Two hundred years of slavery was followed by the Civil War, an event that somehow inspired twisted racists such as the Charleston church killer Dylann Roof the intentional failure of reform during Reconstruction, and then the system of Jim Crow, in which black people were returned to being second-class citizens, lynched, murdered, refused the right to live in certain areas and even to vote.\u0026nbspToday, efforts to suppress the voting rights of minorities persist with vigour in states such as Georgia, while the criminal justice system is utterly discriminatory against people of colour. Three years ago, when the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) announced plans to establish a museum to lynching victims, it estimated at least 4,000 African Americans were summarily murdered – their killings frequently watched by large crowds – between between 1877 and 1950.\u0026nbspWreckage of last ship used to bring slaves to America found in Alabama“It is hard history, and it’s particularly hard for Americans because it runs counter to the narrative we tell about ourselves – you know, freedom and justice for all,” says Swarns, whose work includes American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White, and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.“I think it is much easier to think about slavery as something that is very disconnected from us – long time ago, history book-slow, nothing to do with me today. We’re often known for not being big at looking in the rear view mirror.”She adds: “Coming to an understanding that slavery was as foundational as it was for a country that expounds these ideals\u0026nbspis profoundly difficult. That is on a macro level. At a personal level, I think it is just difficult for people.”Among Swarns’ revelations was that the founders of Georgetown University in Washington DC, which was established by Jesuits, owned slaves. Her 2017 report triggered reflection by a number of US universities where slavery had contributed to their wealth, as well as half-a-dozen in Britain, among them the universities of Oxford, Glasgow, Bristol and East London.Earlier this year, students at Georgetown voted to pay additional tuition fees to help establish a fund to benefit\u0026nbspthe descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold in 1838 to pay off the institution’s debts.Swarns, a contributing writer for the New York Times and associate professor of journalism at New York University, says such gestures give her hope, just as incidents such as the 2017 neo-Nazi march at Charlottesville, make her despair. She says this dichotomy, the shifting back and forth of progress, is also part of America’s story.Carol Anderson, professor of African American Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, has written about the backlash triggered among some white Americans following the election of Barack Obama, the country’s first and only African American president. The reemergence of Tea Party activists, and congressional obstruction, was part a pattern dating to the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment that officially\u0026nbspended slavery.Each time African Americans have made advances, she says in her book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, white reaction has resulted in a deliberate roll back. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Jim Crow era, the Supreme Court’s Brown v Board of Education decision resulted in the shutting down of schools in the South, while the bloody opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to a new, coded response – the so-called Southern Strategy and the “war on drugs”, that took the vote from millions of black people, while helping project Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into the White House.Anderson tells The Independent the US is currently ided between those states wanting to expand access to the ballot box and make the electorate more inclusive, and those seeking to restrict access, in order to reduce the number of minority voters.Why won’t the UK even talk about reparations for slavery?Cory Booker gets 12 co-sponsors on slavery reparations billModern slavery victims ‘sent back to addresses where they were abused’Cambridge slavery inquiry will show we have plenty to feel guilty forSome Americans believe the events of 1619 should not be memorialised at all. When the New York Times magazine announced it was dedicating an issue to mark the arrival of the the first enslaved Africans and what that presaged, a number accused the newspaper of stoking racial tensions.Newt Gringrich, a former Republican speaker of the House and a close ally of Trump, tweeted: “The New York Times 1619 Project should make its slogan ‘All the propaganda we want to brainwash you with’.”Burr, the writer and academic from New Mexico who discovered her link to America’s third vice president, says the opposite. In her words, Americans cannot talk enough what happened, both then and now.“The reason people don’t want to talk about slavery is that they don’t want to dig up the past. They don’t want to take responsibility,” she says.\u0026nbsp“All aspects of what happened to those original Africans, and what happened afterwards, should be discovered and analysed. Not enough people can be told about the 400th anniversary, not enough speeches can happen.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

But, the\u0026nbspsad truth is there\u0027s become an over-reliance on using pre-existing material to either find the\u0026nbspnext big franchise or to capitalise on the success of a bestseller. It\u0027s fair enough – these\u0026nbspadaptations will always be guaranteed large box office takings thanks to the book\u0027s readers\u0026nbspmerely\u0026nbspshowing up\u0026nbspto see\u0026nbsphow the film has translated certain parts to the screen.While there are solid examples of successful big-screen adaptations – The Lord of the Rings,\u0026nbspstray\u0026nbspHarry Potter films, Gone Girl – there have more than likely been a larger number of botch jobs. Nothing is more disappointing than seeing a film version of your favourite book and realising minutes\u0026nbspin that the director\u0026nbsphas misjudged the novel\u0027s spirit or two actors have been cast in the wrong roles and\u0026nbsphave no chemistry whatsoever.This week sees the release of A Million Little Pieces, an addiction drama from Sam Taylor-Wood that follows\u0026nbspan alcoholic and drug abuser\u0027s rehabilitation.

The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).A Million Little Pieces is in cinemas now – and you can read our review here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The coastal city of Miami ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid them becoming projectiles.A state of emergency has officially been declared in Florida.Dorians wind speeds put the storm among the most dangerous in recent history.Forecasters warned that it could be the US East Coasts worst since the category five Hurricane Andrew killed  people and destroyed , homes in .US President Donald Trump said he was monitoring Dorian, which he described as an extremely dangerous storm on Twitter.

It’s with us the people – and that’s why we need to take action.Our message to Johnson is this:you steal our democracy, well shut down the streets.But Tories reacted with fury to Momentums ludicrous plan.David TC Davies told The Sun: Momentum seem to think that no one should do anything without their permission - and theyre going to block the streetsthey dont get their way.And its ironic that they are complaining about Parliament being shut down while they are stopping anyone from getting there at all.Another MP added: “They appear to be trying to ‘Stop the Coup’ as they put it by launching one of their own.”A former Labour MP – Tom Blenkinsop – tweeted that Momentum was “playing into the hands of the right” with their fury.It comes after thousands of people turned up to protest outside Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament last night.Spontaneous protests are being planned in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield too.Earlier today Mr Rees-Mogg urged teeth-gnashing Remainers to change the law or boot the Government out -they can.The Commons leader led the Government fightback today against pro-EU MPs who have vowed to stop Boris Johnson shutting down Parliament next month.Mr Rees-Mogg told them to bring it on - and that the Government was ready.He told the BBC this morning: All these people who are wailing and gnashing of teeth know that there are two ways of doing what they want to do.One, is to change the government and the other is to change the law. If they do either of those, that will then have an effect.If they dont have either the courage or the gumption to do either of those then we will leave on the st of October in accordance with the referendum result.And he added: No party should be afraid of the British people.If they have a vote of confidence, lets seethey can win it.He said the outrage over shutting down Parliament was phoney and blasted Speaker Bercow for his insistent.The teasing came as he said that Mr Corbyn doesnt have enough mates to win such a vote.Nobody wants him to be PM, he joked, labelling those who are trying to thwart Brexit as spewing out phoney outrage because they want to stop us from leaving.They are trying very hard to overturn the referendum result, he blasted.Labours Barry Gardiner confirmed to Sky News today that Labour would apply for an emergency debate next week, and would seek to force Boris to get another Brexit extension.Yesterday Boris asked the Queen for her approval to suspend proceedings for nearly five weeks from as early as September  - and she accepted.Under the extraordinary move, the PM will be able to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday, September  and no later than Thursday, September ."},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew must not duck epstein questions","story":"While the rest of the Royal Family go out of their way to be polite and pleasant to us mere peasants, he appeared to take great joy in making me feel uncomfortable. Well, now it’s his turn to squirm.I have no idea of his exact involvement with the hideous pervert Jeffrey Epstein during their “friendship”, but this week one of Epstein’s alleged victims claimed she had sex with Andrew three times. Virginia Roberts, photographed being embraced by the prince when she was a teenager, claimed he “knows exactly what he has done” and should “come clean” about it.The waters are being muddied with claims by “friends” of Andrew the photo is fake. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing but this story is not going to go away and people are demanding answers.Epstein hanged himself in his New York jail cell this month while on sex-trafficking charges — and sparked conspiracy theories galore.Andrew claims he knew nothing about Epstein’s disgusting lestyle, but it is baffling that he continued to associate with him even after Epstein’s conviction in  for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender.Why on Earth would anyone continue to hang out with such an unsavoury character, especially , like Andrew, you are a dad with two daughters of your own  At the very least this scandal shows that Andrew has appalling judgment when it comes to his pals and associates.He has previous when it comes to cosying up to the rich and dubious. Questions were asked when Andrew sold his run-down “Southyork” mansion to a Kazakh oligarch in  for millions over the asking price.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Jeremy Corbyn and panic-stricken Remainers are now resorting to blatant lies \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN ON SUNDAY SAYS Emmanuel Macron is now bending as European fears about No Deal grow \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Ian-Duncan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentIAIN DUNCAN SMITH Corbyns hate mob are the ones staging a coup with anti-Brexit marches \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Boris Johnsons brightness is a welcome sight after three years of gloom \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-james-forsyth.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJAMES FORSYTH Its rogue ones vs. prorogue ones as MPs fight to seize control of Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Karen-Brady.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentKARREN BRADY Real friends, not screen friends, are the key to keeping your kids happy Again, he denied any wrongdoing and the scandal went away. That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement. It might be embarrassing and uncomfortable — butAndrew has done nothing wrong, he has nothing to worry about.NEVER mind the nights drawing in, you know our summer days are numbered when Strictly rears its sequinned head. This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws. Le really is too short.SHAME on all of those chortling at little Prince George because he is taking ballet lessons. I’m sure none of the mockers have ever actually met a male ballet dancer.Those fellas are as tough as nails.They can beat a bully into a pulp with one flick of their sinewy wrists. They are mentally and physically fiercely strong.I can’t think of a better way for the future king to learn discipline, teamwork and how to push himself to the limit.

With the connivance of the Speaker John Bercow, they will almost certainly succeed.Having gained this power, they will set about binding Boris Johnson’s hands. They will try to legislate to ensure this country cannot leave the European Union without a deal.Do they have the numbers to pull this off  Probably, yes.The ranks of Tory rebels have been swelled by the arrival of former Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, and the Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament means that plans to wait until the end of September to act have been dropped.One former minister says the “prorogation scandal has tipped things over the edge”.If they have the numbers, do they have the time  This is more doubtful.No’s decision to prorogue Parliament means they would have to get a bill through both Houses in just over a week. With Bercow’s help, it will be possible for them to rush it through the Commons quickly. But it will be much harder to do that in the Lords.One Brexit-backing former Secretary of State tells me: “Our lot down there will do their best to talk it out.”Eventhe rebels can get a bill passed, the Government’s actions this week are designed to show that they won’t simply comply with it. They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have stayed in a number of his residences.At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.The Duke was last pictured with Epstein in New York in  after the hedge fund manager had been released from prison and was a registered sex offender.He was infamously pictured with his arm around Virginia Roberts at Ms Maxwells home in London in  - and is thought to have told the Queen her allegations are not true.The alleged sex slave once again spoke out about the Duke this week in which she said Andrew should come clean about their alleged encounters.This comes as we told how Lady Victoria Hervey - who dated Prince Andrew - believes Epstein “spied” on her when she stayed at one of his “sex flats.”And The Sun revealed that Andrew has flown home from a golf holiday for crisis talks with royal advisers.His former we and current companion Sarah Ferguson was also on the private jet flight from Spain as she continues to stand by the Duke of York.The couple feared that staying on holiday in the light of daily revelations relating to the prince’s relationship with Epstein was becoming a bad look."},{"url":null,"title":"benefits mum kids wales epilepsy autism","story":"Bethan Carter, , is mum to five girls and six boys whose ages range from three to .Six of her kids are under the age of ten.Bethan lives with nine of her children in Briton Ferry, near Port Talbot, Wales, along with her husband Andy while two of her kids have since left home.Andy is dad to seven of the youngsters.Bethan struggles with severe epilepsy as well as severe memory loss due to a brain cyst and a malformation at the base of her brain.She also has three kids who suffer from epilepsy and her son Mark, , has severe autism and epilepsy and has several seizures a week.Bethan said: People judge me because I am on benefits, but unless you have a severely autistic child you cant know what it is like.MOST READ IN NEWS\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   KH-COMPOSITE-TRAVELLERS.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" BRIGHTON ROCKED Travellers set up camp with more than  caravans on seaside promenade \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   maggots-emerging.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" WarningFEELING RUFF  Stomach-churning moment dozens of live MAGGOTS are squeezed out of dog by vet \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   as-comp-hula-hoops-factory.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HULA EWW Hula Hoops factory investigated after employee brands it filthy and disgusting \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" FRANTIC SEARCH Cops search for missing -year-old girl who disappeared in east London \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   SD-WOMAN-COMPOSITE.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" SOFT JUSTICE Brit womans horror as Beast of Kavos who raped her is freed  years early I am happy with my family - I do not care what people say.

Bethan said: When he fits, he just collapses and, when he comes out of a fit, he screams. He can not handle the little ones and likes being on his own.Usually Bethan gets up at around am to prepare breakfast for everyone and sort out all the medication for the day and ensure everyone gets the correct ones.Teenager Mark gets picked up by a taxi to take him to school in Bryncoch while Bethan and Andy then do the school run in two cars for the rest.While the kids are at school Bethan then spends her time cleaning and tidying the house.After the children have all been picked up from school Bethan will then start on dinner.She said:  I can not cook so I just try to make things quickly like beans or sausages.I try to have dinner ready shortly after they get back from school.If it has been a long day and it is getting late, we will get a KFC or a McDonalds.The family say they have fast food once or twice a week with each of these meals costing up to £.They also do a big monthly food shop at Farm Foods which costs £. This includes around £ on sausages and six boxes of  fish fingers for £.Some how they manage to fit it all in their two chest freezers and a fridge freezer.We get frozen food mainly because it is cheaper and more convenient, Bethan said.

We spend all year saving for Christmas.At the moment, the family live in a five-bedroom house in Briton Ferry, with three of the girls sleeping in one bedroom and three boys in another. The youngest one sleeps in the parents bedroom and then Mark and Amy - the two oldest - have their own rooms.Bethan and Andy met  years ago through an advert in the South Wales Evening Post.Andy said: I like having that many kids, it is always busy - it is non-stop.People can judge me as much as they want but I do not care.The family have recently been having problems with the roof over their back bedroom, which recently collapsed during a spell of bad weather.A lot of water started coming through and the family was told a new roof was needed.Andy said some temporary measures have been in place by housing association Tai Tarian but the roof is still not fixed.He said Mark sleeps in the bedroom with the damaged ceiling and has had to sleep in a dferent room.Andy said Mark doesnt understand why he cant stay in his room and that they have had to buy a new mattress and bedding after the water came through the roof.I am worried the ceiling could collapse any time, he said. It is not secure at all how it is now - it is going to cave in the moment it rains even a little bit.Andrew Carey from Tai Tarian said: “During the recent severe bad weather, we were made aware of the roof leak within the property and a temporary solution was carried out as soon as physically possible to stop the leak.The permanent solution has been planned in and the tenant has been made aware of all our intentions.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane dorian category 5 speed us latest","story":"The eye of the storm - now at the highest possible category - is expected to lay waste to the Abaco Islands before barrelling northwards to Florida and Georgia.A National Hurricane Centre spokesman said: The eyewall of this catastrophic hurricane is about to hit the Abaco Islands with devastating winds.It is expected to make landfall on Floridas eastern coast before spinning through Georgia and South Carolina.A National Hurricane Centre spokesman said:The eyewall of this catastrophic hurricane is about to hit the Abaco Islands with devastating winds.A prolonged period of le-threatening storm surge, devastating winds, and le-threatening flash floods are expected.According to tracking site FlightAware,  flights to, from or within America were cancelled on Saturday.And as of this morning another  planes were grounded for US trips scheduled for Sunday.The site said: “We expect these numbers to increase in the upcoming days, especially at airports in the region where Dorian is to make landfall.”Airlines have been issuing waivers to customers for several days for journeys which are heading to destinations in the hurricane’s path, reports CNN.While travel firms have issued advisories to cities in Florida, Georgia and the Caribbean – more waiver options will be issued for the Carolinas as the massive storm moves northwards up the east coast.Operations at Orlando International Airport will be suspended at am Monday local time, according to an official statement.Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale International Airport have yet to confirm what action they will take and are monitoring the hurricane’s path, it has been reported.Radar shows the eye of Hurricane Dorian during a reconnaissance mission over the Atlantic OceanThe mph storm shted its path and could graze Floridas coast and continue on to Georgia and North and South Carolina.And that’s the same route as Category  Matthew took three years ago – hugging the southern east coast of the country while still causing billions of dollars of damage.The killer hurricane devastated the four states bringing wind and flood damage, killing  and leaving millions without power.But Bryan Norcross, a senior hurricane specialist, told Florida Today that Dorian is moving even slower than Matthew which means it could wreak more havoc on the sunshine state.He said: “As it stands right now, coastal Florida has got to be ready for storm surge exceeding Matthew. And higher winds than Matthew. And heavier rain than Matthew.Just be ready for that. We’re in a position where you’re talking three, four, five days in advance of what you have to be ready for.“The threat is real from the Treasure Coast throughout the Florida peninsula. The trend is somewhat favourable — though the danger is still high along the immediate coastline.”The devastation caused by Dorian could be made worse by exceptionally strong tides called King Tide -which makes coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding.The super-strength tide happens around the time as a full moon or new moon and this year the King Tides have already flooded neighbourhoods in Miami - and the most recent full moon was yesterday.The storms winds reached mph today - just mph shy of becoming a Category  hurricane.Winds are currently raging over the warm Atlantic waters and is inching towards the northwestern Bahamas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The centre says the storms path is still unpredictable, but Georgia and the Carolinas are now at risk of strong winds and le-threatening storm surge.The hurricane has slowed down since Thursday as it was originally expected to make landfall by Sunday.The NHC still warned Florida residents to say on alert.They said: It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty.Supermarket shelves have been left bare as residents scramble to prepare for the Category  storm.Floridians left supermarket shelves empty after grabbing water, bread and canned goods in the event power and water are cut off.At a Publix supermarket in Cocoa Beach, Ed Ciecirski of the customer service department said the pharmacy was extra busy with people rushing to fill prescriptions.Saturday: Dorian is expected to slow its forward motion and will likely begin to impact the northwestern Bahamas with tropical storm-force winds by Saturday night.Sunday: Dorians hurricane siege will begin in the northwest Bahamas as it continues to slow down. Tropical storm-force winds may begin to arrive in parts of Florida. Large swells should begin to arrive at the coast from North Carolina to Florida.Monday: Dorian may still be hammering the northwest Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain, strong winds may affect parts of Florida. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is uncertain at this time.Tuesday-Thursday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeast near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane force winds away from land, to a landfall anywhere in this zone.Friday-Next Saturday: Dorian is then expected to race off the Northeast Seaboard, but could track close enough to bring rain and some wind to the Virginia Tidewater, Nantucket, Marthas Vineyard and Cape Cod, before it heads toward the Canadian Maritimes by next weekend.The grocery was rationing bottled water and had run out of dry ice.Homeowners and businesses rushed to cover their windows with plywood.Tfany Miranda of Miami Springs, Florida said: I feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened.What’s the use of going all the way to Georgiait can land there You never know with these hurricanes. It could be good, it could be bad.

Mr Gove - who is in charge of planning for no-deal - promised today that everyone will have the food they need after October .The Cabinet Office minister added: No, there will be no shortages of fresh food. But Mr Goveaposs claims were blasted as categorically untrue by the British Retail Consortium, which represents more than , firms.A spokesman said: It is categorically untrue that the supply of fresh food will be unaffected under a no deal Brexit.The retail industry has been crystal clear in its communications with Government over the past  months that the availability of fresh foods will be impacted as a result of checks and delays at the border.Indeed, the Government’s own assessments showed that the flow of goods through the channel crossings could be reduced by -% from day , as would the “availability and choice” of some foods. The slapdown came after Mr Gove also admitted some food prices look set to rise in a no-deal Brexit.     Mr Gove admitted: There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.” A leaked document from the governmentaposs Operation Yellowhammer predicted some supplies of fresh food will fallthe UK crashes out without a deal on Halloween . The document said while there would not be an overall shortage of food, there would be less availability and choice, affecting vulnerable groups. Meanwhile, the government has already publicly warned school leaders they could have to substitute ingredients in pupilsapos dinners. As a result, councils are bracing for school dinners to become more expensive, as well as the risk nutrition standards will be changed. Pressed by the BBC today on whether there would be shortages of fresh food in no-deal, Mr Gove at first refused to answer. Instead he said: Everyone will have the food they need. When asked for a second time by interviewer Andrew Marr, he said: No, there will be no shortages of fresh food. But the BRC spokesman said: The BRC’s own assessment has shown that soft fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries, tomatoes and lettuces, would likely see reduced availability as they are largely imported during the winter months.  “While retailers continue to work with their suppliers to maintain stocks of non-perishable goods and plan ahead for any disruption caused by a no deal Brexit, it is impossible to mitigate it fully as neither retailers nor consumers can stockpile fresh foods. The reality remains that a no deal Brexit in October would present the worst of all worlds for our high streets and those who shop there. Retailers will be preparing for Christmas, stretching already limited warehousing capacity, and the UK will be importing the majority of its fresh food from the EU, magnying the impact of border delays.” It comes amid reports Mr Gove is planning to publish a heavily watered-down version of the original Yellowhammer warnings.    The document was presented to Cabinet ministers on around August , yet the Sunday Times reports officials are now making extensive changes to it before making it public. A Westminster source told the newspaper: This document is currently being neutralised, with all emotive language being stripped out. Mr Gove today insisted the governmentaposs Yellowhammer documents were a worst case scenario and suggested Mr Marr was talking about project fear.

The Boris Johnson ally was condemned as breathtaking after he failed to guarantee the Prime Minister will obey a law blocking no-deal - which MPs are set to pass this week. Jeremy Corbyn warned it would be a full-blown attack on our constitution adding: Johnson’s attempts to undermine parliamentary sovereignty are shameful and will be fought every step of the way. And Tory MP Guto Bebb branded the comments a disgrace to our democracy. MPs will table a law against no-deal on Tuesday, and try to rush it through the Commons and Lords before Parliament is suspended in around  daysapos time. But reports have suggested the Tory government could take extreme steps to stop it, like refusing to grant the Bill Royal Assent. And today, Cabinet Office minister Mr Gove - who is in charge of no-deal planning - failed to give a straight answer when asked four timesthe government would abide by the law. The first time, he told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: Letaposs see what the legislation says. You’re asking me about a pig in a poke. And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.  The second time he was asked, he repeated: We will see what the legislation says when it is put forward. For me the most important thing is to bear in mind actually, we already have legislation in place which an overwhelming majority of MPs voted for. We already have an EU Withdrawal Act, we already have the notice on Article  , the process by which we leave the EU.    What [ Labour Brexit chief] Keir Starmer is trying to do now is to say you know the British people I said we would leave, I said in my manesto we would leave, but now I actually think we wonapost leave. That is a denial of democracy. Asked a third time what will happenMr Starmer passes a law that blocks no-deal, he said: I don’t believe Keir Starmer will get legislation through to that effect. Asked a fourth time, he said: Letaposs see what the legislation is that he puts forward. I canapost comment on a Bill that Keir Starmer, for entirely understandable reasons, hasnapost yet published. Mr Goveaposs comments - branded simply astonishing by UCLaposs Constitution Unit - prompted swt fury. Tory MP Guto Bebb said Mr Goveaposs comments were a disgrace to our democracy, adding: Not only are they suspending Parliament to try and force through a disastrous no-deal, but now they are suggesting that, evenParliament passed a law requiring the Government to avoid no-deal, they might simply ignore it. Our very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his Government.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: For ministers not to confirm that this Government will accept and comply with legislation lawfully passed is breathtaking. The Prime Minister must make a statement on this straightaway. No Government is above the law. Labouraposs deputy leader Tom Watson said: A powerful government representative refusing to confirm they’ll obey the legislative will of Parliament. Think about that for a moment. This is the UK. The correct answer is aposwe will always obey the will of Parliamentapos. Jon Trickett, Labouraposs Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, said: Boris Johnson has shown his contempt for our democracy and the British people. Any move to ignore an act of Parliament would be a full-blown attack on our constitution.  It is staggering that in the same interview, Michael Gove admitted that the No Deal Brexit the government is attempting to ram through will hit people’s living standards with increased food prices. This is a price that Boris Johnson is willing to pay because it won’t be him and his wealthy friends paying it – but ordinary families already struggling after  years of austerity. It is the people, not an unelected Prime Minister in hock to the vested interests of the richest, who should determine our country’s future. Labour MP Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee, said: It’s a very simple question so how can there be any doubt about the answer  The Government must abide by any legislation that is passed by Parliament.  Legal commentator David Allen Green noted drily: In which Michael Gove , a former Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, will not commit the government to complying with the rule of law. It comes after pro-EU Tory MPs hurled themselves into war with Boris Johnson by facing down his threat to cast them out of the party this week.  The Prime Minister is considering yanking away the Tory whip from more than a dozen rebelsthey vote to block no-deal Brexit on Thursday. But ringleader MP David Gauke today dared the PM to dump him - saying heaposs ready to become an independent in the national interest. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond said suspending the whip would be staggeringly hypocritical because  members of the current cabinet have defied the party whip this year.  The Prime Minister, who has a majority of one, faces defeatthe MPs can pass the law in the tiny period of time before he suspends Parliament for five weeks, from around September . Tens of thousands took to streets across Britain yesterday to demand Mr Johnson stop the the month-long shutdown coup. But any Tory MP who sides with opposition MPs and votes against no-deal could have the whip withdrawn, be suspended, and replaced with a Johnson loyalist candidate at the next election.

Writing in the same newspaper, the Speakeraposs former deputy - Labouraposs Natascha Engel - said he is in open opposition to leave voters.    Ms Engel, who was ousted from the Commons in the  snap election, said the former Tory should accept he cannot change his role from impartial referee to partisan player-manager. She said the Speaker has invented new rules and in doing so, is not only in open opposition to the people, who voted Leave, but he may actually cause the hard Brexit that his Remain supporters are so keen to avoid. The Speaker of the House of Commons is a non-partisan role and Mr Bercow said in March: If Iaposm biased, Iaposm biased in favour of Parliament. Parliament being heard. But MPs have accused Mr Bercow of naked bias after he allowed a vote on the so-called Grieve Amendment on a version of Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal - and refused to hold a third meaningful vote on the deal in March.  "},{"url":null,"title":"voice people something needs done","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the People: Something needs to be done about kne crime amid % five-year riseThe latest terrying figures show there were , such offences in the year to March .

You have helped raise nearly £, – enough to start treatment for tiny Theo Hutton, who was revived seven minutes after being stillborn. This month parents Laura and Andy will take the tot, who has cerebral palsy, to Panama for stem surgery. They hope it will be the first of five such treatments aimed at massively enhancing the quality of their happy -month-old son’s le. The couple want to raise £, for Theo. Laura, , said: “The fact that people we don’t know have seen the story and donated is just amazing.  “We can’t thank them enough. Now our focus is to keep going so we can take him back for a second course in seven or eight months time.” The pioneering stem cell surgery, not currently available on the NHS, has led to huge improvements in other children who suffer from the incurable and ­crippling condition. Theo’s brain was starved of oxygen in the course of the dficult birth and he is unable to sit, walk or talk. Laura and Andy were told Theo was a blue baby and he was immediately whisked away. They described it as every “parent’s worst nightmare”.  After they watched him being ­resuscitated the tot was placed on le-support, ­attached to numerous wires and tubes, while his parents were told he might not make it. Laura cried when she could finally hold Theo for the first time. He was five days old. After they finally took him home they soon realised he wasn’t developing at the same rate as other babies. At  months he was ­diagnosed with cerebral palsy – a condition which affects one in  UK tots. Laura said the treatment in Panama aims to stimulate stem cell growth in the brain.  She said: “He will have five stem cell treatments via IV drips. One a day for five days. We are hopeful that it will help him. Every small step for Theo is a massive step for us.” The procedure would see  ­millions stem cells from a donor umbilical cord injected into Theo’s system to stimulate and repair damaged nervous tissue in the brain. Laura and Andy, , hope to take him to the Stem Cell Institute in Panama City once a year for the next five years. Each course of treatment will cost about £, but the couple say it could improve the youngster’s le hugely, helping him achieve milestones they can only dream of at the moment. Laura, a health and safety manager from Wirral, Merseyside, said: “Around  per cent of your brain is ­developed by the time you are five so, hopefully, we can get the first three treatments in by then so they would have the most benefit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit womans horror beast who","story":"NewsBrit womans horror as beast who raped her at Kavos resort freed  years earlyEXCLUSIVE: Kayleigh Morgan was subjected to a -hour ordeal by Dimitris Aspiotis, known as The Beast of Kavos - named after the party resort on the Greek island of Corfu where he pouncedShareByPatrick Hill:,  AUG NewsKayleigh Morgan was subjected to a -hour ordeal by Dimitris Aspiotis\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The Duchess was pregnant with Prince Louis when George started at Thomasaposs and she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum , a severe and sometimes le-threatening illness which affects mums-to-be. William had the important job instead, and held hands with a very shy looking George as they walked across the playground to meet head of the Lower School, Helen Haslem. George managed to offer a handshake to his new teacher but kept his eyes on the ground, refusing to let his father too far out of his sight.    The Duke then took his son inside to the reception classroom. George is reportedly doing very well at school , where he studies a number of subjects including religious studies, computing and ballet. A source told Vanity Fair : Heaposs very popular and has lots of friends, and thereaposs very little fuss made about who he is.    Either William or Kate do drop off, and they are always very friendly. William particularly loves to have a chat with some of the other parents and he works out with some of the mums at the Harbour Club after drop off. Heaposs very chatty and amiable.

So when she launched lestyle blog, The Tig, she felt exposed as it was aposher babyapos where she expressed the real her. Andyou didn’t like it, then you probably wouldnapost like her, she said. It would be her own honest thoughts and feelings she was exposing - and not a character penned by a writer. Writing her aposyear in reviewapos on New Yearaposs Eve in , Meghan wrote: Where did this year go  I know you’re probably like me and find yourself saying that at every year’s end, but seriously - where did  go  It was just May and I was sitting with butterflies in my stomach, coercing my finger to press the send button on  Twitter .It was time for me to say that this website, this passion project, this thing called The Tig was going live. And I was petried. That may come as a surprise to you, but let’s be real for a moment. I’m an actor. I have made a career of saying other people’s words for a living and making them sound believable. Yes, we color them with nuance and add subtext to the writing, but at the end of the day I can hide behind the character.  It’s their words, their choices. The writer puts them on paper and I give them a voice. Simply speaking, I am the vehicle. But this Tig thing…that was all me. My thoughts, my words, my likes, my ethos. If you didn’t like it, then you probably didn’t like me. And Ihad to be okay with that. Although Meghan could not anticipate what reaction the now-defunct website would receive, it went on to be a huge success, with tips on fashion, beauty, travel and interviews with celebrities and chefs.    She continued in the blog post: This brainchild of mine – of inspired living and dreams coming true, of food and fashion, fancy friends, of role models that make the earth shake, and travel that leaves you absolutely breathless – it caught on. My aposlittle engine that couldapos – did. And it’s because of you. May this year bring you endless joy. I hope you take a risk, that you do something that gives you butterflies in the pit of your belly, that you live a le less stled, and that you exceed your own expectations. You absolutely can and you absolutely must.    Without question this is the happiest I have ever been – personally, professionally, wholly. You are a very large part of that, and I thank you from the bottom of my beating heart. Thank you, my friend, and cheers to a most beautul ! Meghan closed the website, along with her social media accounts down, following her engagement to Prince Harry.She previously disclosed personal details about her relationship with father, Thomas Markle."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harrys pals","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harrys friends fear they are planning big move to LAPals are reportedly concerned Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry are considering relocating after allegedly snubbing an estate offer from Prince CharlesShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video kind-hearted-meghan-dragged-away-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The newspaper added: Friends say Meghan and Harry are in ‘victim mode’ and do not feel they need to change their actions, but rather, change the people around them and possibly even the country they call home.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that.

There are clever lighting and curtain effects that make the area quite attractive.We were brought a bottle of water and the cocktails, wine and food menus.Our waitress explained they had  Brewing beers on tap though there were bottles available too. My husband enjoys the likes of Peroni or Coors, but these aren’t sold here. He took a bottle of Lagunitas IPA, on our server’s recommendation, and I knee-jerked into Bacardi and diet coke as I was unsure of what  they had and a request for Kahlua had met with a blank stare. It would be goodthey perhaps did a beer and spirits menu too. vw, px\"  The drinks came and we were told the soupswere langoustine chowder and one I didn’t order .Other starters included chicken and duck liver parfait with rhubarband hot smoked salmon with pickled egg yolk . Across the table the choice was for scallops, apples and alliumsan unusual combination, we thought, but he loves scallops. The mains choices range from the £ mark, with a few vegetarian options – spelt grain and barley risotto and a courgette lasagne being two.I struggled a little bit with the menu – a lot of the dishes contained elements I just don’t like, chicken with sweetcorn ragout, duck with spiced pear, sea trout with pea veloute. I’m not sophisticated enough for this!I was on the steak option – Campbell’s Gold ribeyeor steak frites, oz flat iron steak , I chose the latter as I hadn’t had it before. My other half chose the grilled whole sea bream with rocket, orange and pine nut salad . vw, px\"  My soup was served with a poppy seeded roll – I was a little disappointed that bread hadn’t put on the table to nibble on while we waited – but my roll and soup were very nice. The chowder had lots of finely chopped veg in it.The seafood was also served in a bowl and the four quite small scallops didn’t seem to merit the price tag. However, they were cooked to perfection and the mix with the apple and alliumwas fabulous. But another couple wouldn’t have gone amiss. vw, px\"  The mains came – my steak was medium rare as requested and served on a warmed marble plate with the chips in a separate dish.My husband agreed to having his fish filleted. The server used two spoons to cut off the head and tail and get the backbone etc out. She did warn there would still be bones in it and, unfortunately, there were quite a few. I’d have found this off-putting, but he coped manfully. vw, px\"  I shared my pile of chips and steak – the chips were to die for, crispy and tasty and the steak had a lovely flavour but was a little chewy in places. I’m not familiar with the cut, so perhaps that was due to how I had it cooked.The sea bream was tasty, but I’m not sure it is something we’d order again. vw, px\"  A fellow diner had a burger deliveredand I had a severe case of food envy. It looked wonderful.The desserts were fancy ice cream and sorbet and a bruleebut we decided to go for the Scottish and French cheeses .The plate came with six pieces of cheese, oatcakes, chutney and pickled grapes. It was very pleasant and I loved the chutney, though I wouldn’t rush to eat another pickled grape!I had an espresso martiniwhile my other half – who’d swapped his beer with me – ordered himself a second Bacardi.

with a close range effort.Ross County twice hit the woodwork, once from the penalty spot.Aberdeen made four changes to the side that stuttered to a dire - stalemate with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park last weekend.Two were enforced with Scott McKenna and Shaleum Logan both ruled out through injury.Centre-back McKenna is out for up to a month with a hamstring tear suffered on the articial surface at Rugby Park.Right-back Logan was ruled out having undergone a minor procedure on a groin problem.It meant Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes had only four fit defenders available # with no defensive back up on the bench.However they secured a clean sheet.Wingers Ryan Hedges and Niall McGinn both ed to the starting line-up with James Wilson and Jon Gallagher dropping to the bench.Aberdeen began with attacking intent and forced two corners inside the opening two minutes but both came to nothing.The Reds should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Ryan Hedges played a quick free quick to release Niall McGinn on the right flank.McGinn#ss low cross was palmed out by keeper Ross Laidlaw as far as Sam Cosgrove who capitalized to shoot low from  yards only to have his shot cleared off the line by Keith Watson.Aberdeen spurned another glorious opportunity in the th minute when Greg Leigh broke down the left and squared a pass into the penalty area but with the goal beckoning McGinn lted it high over the bar from  yards.In the rd minute Ferguson curled a free kick from the left into the box which Mikey Devlin met but his  yard glancing header flew wide.The Dons two game Premiership goal drought ended in the th minute with a set piece straight off the training ground.Rather than fire a free kick  yards out directly into the penalty area McGinn slid it wide to the unmarked Hedges on the right who immediately whipped in a curling cross that found LEIGH.The left-back powered home a  yard header beyond keeper Laidlaw.Aberdeen doubled their advantage two minutes later when Ferguson was clumsily brought down in the box by keeper Laidlaw.Leading scorer COSGROVE comfortably converted to the keeper#s left hand side for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen made it # in the th minute when McGinn cut inside on the left and delivered a superb cross towards the back post and HEDGES raced from the right to slide it in from close range.A minute later Ross County were awarded a penalty by referee Nick Walsh when a powerful drive from Stewart hit Funso Ojo#s hand from close range.Ojo was booked. Staggies failed to capitalize as Billy McKay#s spot kick rattled Joe Leiws# right hand post.Aberdeen continued to threaten when McGinn shot over the bar then minutes later Cosgrove had an effort saved by keeper Laidlaw.In the th minute Stewart broke in on goal and unleashed a curling shot that cracked off the far post from  yards.

on aggregate to Croatian side Rijeka.A - stalemate at Kilmarnock last weekend made it just four points from the opening three Premiership matches.McInnes knows the heat is on but said: “The pressure is never off Aberdeen.“There is always a pressure to win, especially at home.“I know more than most what is required here.“We need to remind folk we won the cup tie at Dundee off the back of a European tie.“Although - at Kilmarnock wasn’t good enough from my point of view and we still expect more, in isolation it isn’t the worst result in the world.”Aberdeen’s defence has been hit by three injury set-backs this week.Following scans on an injury sustained at Rugby Park it was confirmed Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna will be out for up to a month with a hamstring tear.Centre-back Ash Taylor also suffered a setback in his rehabilitation from a hamstring tear that has sidelined the summer signing since the - Europa League draw with Chikhura Sachkhere in Georgia on July .Aberdeen are awaiting the results of a scan but it is feared Taylor will be ruled out for a number of weeks.The Reds will also give a late fitness test to Shaleum Logan after the right-back underwent a minor procedure on a groin problem.If Logan is unavailable McInnes will have just four defenders available for the clash with the Staggies – Andy Considine, Greg Leigh, Mikey Devlin and Zak Vyner.McInnes has challenged the Dons to go into the upcoming international break buoyed by a victory.He said: “We are looking forward to the challenge of winning three points and feeling a bit better about ourselves.“We want to look at the league table and be a bit happier with that.“It is important we just concentrate on our own performance and that we bring a strong team performance.“The players will be absolutely fine this season and it is important we try to get the three points.“We know the level of performance we are capable of so it is up to us to try to find that.”Ross County suffered a heavy -

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"onboard-volunteers-dedicated-saving-scotland-39-s-dolphins-whales","story":"I head below. Itrsquos the worst place to be when sea-sickness strikes, but my attempt to travel without vomiting on a sailing boat through the Sea of the Hebrides is over. I steady my footing in the cabin and gulp down two Stugeron tablets, then dash back on deck where I watch the waves coming, the best way to fight the nausea.An hour later the tablets seem to kick in and Irsquom fine despite the rolling action.I take my turn on lookout duty, clipping myself to the deck to ensure I donrsquot fall off. I scan the sea for whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and creel buoys. Itrsquos what wersquore here to do.Wersquore on the Silurian, the ft sailing ketch at the heart of the work of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, to carry out research into the whales and dolphins ndash cetaceans ndash and other wildle in the seas off the west coast.More than  species of whales, dolphins and porpoises are regularly seen plus common seals, and we have a third of the world population of the larger grey seals. But they are under threat: from noise, pollution, discarded fishing gear and even tourism. A Cuvierrsquos beaked whale stranded on Skye in  died with its belly full of plastic bags. Over a hundred of the deep-ing whales were found dead last summer in the north Atlantic, most of them in Scotland. Military sonar is a strong suspect.Entanglements in creel ropes and other equipment is a regular problem for cetaceans and seals, with a dead whale in Scrabster recently tangled in creel gear from Nova Scotia. Last but not least, marine mammals are victims of their own popularity. Tourists crowd onto boats to see them, and tour operators are under pressure to provide ever-closer encounters. Scottish Wildle Trust has called for tougher controls on tourism operations.The data from the Silurian ndash collected in , hours of volunteer work on more than  trips on the west coast ndash is crucial. The Trustrsquos science officer Lauren Hartny-Mills gives an example: having hard facts enables it and other agencies in the Scottish Entanglement Alliance to engage with fishing operators over why entanglements happen and their impacts, and come up with solutions.She says: ldquoNo entanglement is intentional and itrsquos really upsetting for the fishers who find these animals in distress in their gear, but they also lose money from cutting animals free and lost fishing time.Survey information is used to find where marine animals and fishing gear clash, and photo data collected on surveys can give clues to what injuries cetaceans suffer at the hands of man-made objects and machinery.And the data is particularly important because Government consultations are afoot for four new Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters, three off the west coast, including a , sq km one in the Sea of the Hebrides.Data from the Silurian has been key in defining that last MPA and a smaller one off the north east coast of Lewis. HWDT information on the movements of minke whales and Rissorsquos dolphins and other creatures will help the Scottish Government set the MPA rules under which fishing, tourism and development are regulated.After heading west out of Tobermory in the early morning, we face the full force of the weather as we turn south-west into the sea lane between Mull, Coll and Tiree. With me on the boat are volunteers Jenny Hampson, based on Mull, and Andy Tait, whorsquos from the north-east of England but spends much of his time on the island. The rest of the six-strong volunteer complement is made up of young undergraduates, mainly marine science students, who combine knowledge of the sea environment and its problems with an enthusiasm and delight in the wildle.Mancunian Hampson is studying for a masters in marine mammal science at St Andrews, and was a full-time volunteer for the trust for nine months. She s like an extra member of staff, knowing the routines and the rules from helping out on previous trips.As the rolling eases near the dramatic little Treshnish Isles, I head below again where shersquos at work. Information on species, direction of travel, distance and behaviour of any animal spotted is yelled down from the watch team on the mast, and she shows me how itrsquos put into a database and turned into statistics.In the rough conditions and rain itrsquos much harder to see anything on the surface, and thatrsquos where the hydrophone towed behind the boat comes into its own.Hampson explains it collects the sounds of porpoises, which are plotted into the database. It also shows up the whistles of dolphins, the snapping sounds made by shrimps, and things such as the acoustic deterrent devices which blare out sound to drive seals away from fish farms.ldquoI wanted to do this since I was about five ndash I have always been one of those whale nuts, says Hampson.Tait has been a volunteer for HWDT since it started in . On his trips hersquos seen orca, four dferent species of dolphin as well as masses of other wildle ndash hersquos good on bird identication too.ldquoI do it all because I love wildle. This is what I live for now since I retired, he says.Wersquore on only the third of a new series of winter-months surveys by Silurian. In the past she has normally sailed from April to October only, taking paying volunteers on trips of up to  days across the Hebrides, counting the mammals as they go. That has built up a wealth of data but more information is needed.This trip is paid for out of a grant from the Scottish Governmentrsquos wildle agency Scottish Natural Heritagendash HWDT will get a total of around pound, over three years year from SNH for its survey work ndash and these winter surveys are dferent, drawing on local volunteers to do similar work for shorter periods, at short notice, as weather windows allow.Volunteers go free on the three-day trips but they have to put up with the lurching winter seas, and sometimes worse: on Januaryrsquos trip they were chipping ice off the deck. More winter surveys will follow over the next two years, giving scientists the first proper picture of what west coast cetacean and seal populations are like in winter and how they behave.We turn east, and my second night aboard is spent moored in a small cove on the north side of Ulva, off the coast of Mull, whose inhabitants famously won more than pound million from the Scottish Government to buy the island and tempt people to repopulate it.From here it looks bleak and inhospitable, and we scrap a plan for a run ashore in favour of sketching, board games and chat before an early night. Some of the students sit drawing simple outlines of marine mammals, trying to capture the essence of the creatures, the movement that makes their massive forms so graceful.Everyone helps with cooking and clearing up, with Burgess and first mate Brian Condon giving a gentle guiding hand.The next day we retrace our steps, and as we turn back into the Sound of Mull, and get the stf south-west wind behind us, the engine is switched off and we come under pure sail.Four oyster catchers pass, much faster than the boat, bouncing in the wind as they dip and flit. The light, down into the sound and in towards the folded land, is shting in the heaps of mist and cloud. A rag of blue sky slips away, the brightness briefly lighting the toe of the ness ahead.On deck the volunteers are concentrating hard on the count. We have seen seals and harbour porpoise, but so far none of the larger marine mammals. However hard yoursquore looking, though, itrsquos dficult not to be distracted by the beauty around you.Burgess tells me this interplay of light and sea is what she loves. ldquoPeople ask meI get bored with just sea and sky to look at. But even when yoursquore right out at sea with no land in sight, it changes all the time ndash itrsquos fascinating.As skipper and boat manager she commands her one crew member, decides where and how we travel, looks after motley volunteers including myself, and helps ensure the vital survey work is done properly. As she steers the boat she tells me she ldquofell back into the west coast of Scotland and became skipper a year ago after working as first mate on Silurian then as a er and sailor around the world.A Mull native who studied marine biology, shersquos from a fishing family and has an ease born of years of familiarity with the boat, the sea and the whole system that keeps us alive in this alien environment. She also chips in on occasion with a reality check about people needing to make a living when volunteer enthusiasm for marine conservation bubbles over.Working the Silurian is a dferent challenge to other sailing jobs. The science comes first and that means travelling in straight lines ndash transects ndash at seven knots, so consistent counts of animals and objects can be made.ldquoWe try to cover as many dferent areas as possible that we havenrsquot done before but the weather quite often doesnrsquot let us go exactly where we want to go, Burgess says. ldquoYou also have to think about where you can anchor on the evening so people get a good nightrsquos rest so they can carry on working the next day.ldquoThen you have the tides, which also dictate where wersquore going, there are massive tidal streams around a lot of the islands. ldquoItrsquos a ever-ending puzzle of trying to work out whatrsquos going to be the most effective way of managing to survey the areas wersquore going to cover.The boat was built in Seattle in  and has led a colourful career: in the s it was picked up by the US Coastguard off the coast of Florida and impounded for smuggling cocaine from Columbia. A few years later she was used by a team filming for the first Blue Planet documentary for the BBC, before being acquired by the Trust in .Burgess says Silurianrsquos considerable weight allows the vessel to batter through much of the bad weather. A refit last year smartened her rigging up, and the combination of sails and engine means she can make the best of any weather.Our third evening is spent moored in the small bay north-west of Castle Duart on the heel of Mull towards Oban. The constant drizzle that soaked the last watch of volunteers has stopped as I step out on deck in the early evening with Becky Dudley, HWDTrsquos marine bioersity officer.We watch fascinated as the moon slides in and out of cloud, throwing silver onto flat dusk water. As we talk a common seal approaches the boat, drawing smiles and coos from the volunteers.Dudley admits to her personal devotion to whales and dolphins: it started with a cetacean-themed quilt-cover as a child. But, she says the science is what matters, and decision-making using hard data is essential: ldquoItrsquos really important for instance that the boundaries and what happens in the MPAs arenrsquot just based on guesswork. You want solid scientic data to show where the animals are, where theyrsquore not, how the populations are doing within that area and how many species are using that area.Later I ask the Trustrsquos director Alison Lomax why it is that peoplersquos unscientic, almost anthropomorphic ideas, draw them towards cetaceans.ldquoWith whales and dolphins therersquos certainly a connection that those types of animals allow you to make, she says ldquoThese animals are so mysterious, we are still learning so much about them, and yet there are so many similarities between us and them in terms of our biology and parts of our behaviour.ldquoFor me itrsquos that key moment where you get just that glimpse of a whale or a dolphin and your world and theirs meets ndash that is something that is quite inspiring, and it brings tears to some peoplersquos eyes.At Castle Duart we are up early next day for a full dayrsquos work before we head back to port. The boat chugs into Loch Linnhe, flat water welcome on the balance and legs, but itrsquos dull compared to the wave-crashing, swell-riding trip to Ulva and back. There are more seals and creels, but not much sign of cetaceans as we head up and around Lismore, then back south around Morven.Then, by the scar of the huge Glensanda quarry, therersquos a wave of excitement. Someone has spotted a common dolphin, the first of the trip after three days, gently rising with a graceful arch of the back, and sliding back below the ruffled water. Every time we think wersquove seen the last of it, it pops up again, close enough and high enough to see the distinctive cream-coloured patches on its sides.Cameras click, and it is recorded in the data base: species, behaviour, direction of travel, bearing from the boat, another small case to add to the thousands logged by the Silurian.Dudley, however, looks concerned. She plans to report the sighting to British Divers Marine Le Rescue . The animal is alone, which is unusual its calm, smooth movement is a bit too gentle for a creature often seen leaping and twisting around. There could be something amiss, and local observers from BDMLR can keep an eye out in case the animal is injured or unwell, and ends up stranded.Later she tells me therersquos been no response to her call, indicating the animal has not been spotted again or got into trouble, but itrsquos another indication of the care HWDT staff take of these animals. The survey work can be enjoyable, there can be glorious moments and exciting sightings, but working on the Silurian, and volunteering on it, is no easy task, as the seasickness taught me. That the Trust, staff and volunteers take this task on, helps not only the animals they care for but the whole marine ecosystem. Whatever drives them, wersquore better off for it.PROTECTION ndash OR JUST PAPER PARKS Four new Marine Protected Areas are proposed by the Scottish Government: the , sq km Sea of the Hebrides MPA the smaller North East Lewis and nearby Shiant East Bank MPAs and the Southern Trench MPA off the Aberdeenshire and Moray coasts.All are supposed to protect a range of animals and features, but data collected by HWDTrsquos teams will be crucial in protecting Minke whales and basking sharks in the Sea of the Hebrides, and Rissorsquos dolphins off Lewis.The Scottish Government is consulting on how they should be defined, and designation does mean some constraints on development. After that there will be y debate over ldquomanagement measures, controlling activity with the MPA areas, with the battle lines likely to be drawn between conservation campaigners and the fishing industry.The consultation document suggests a cost of poundm to the oil and gas, power transmission and fishing industries from the strictest likely control measures, although it says the benefits to the economy could be far greater.Nick Underwood of Scottish conservation charity Open Seas fears the MPAs will be designated but wonrsquot have the rules in place needed to regulate damaging activity. ldquoThese sites are already long delayed ndash there have been worrying delays in the implementation of these MPAs, he says. ldquoThese sites need to be designated as soon as possible with meaningful management. Until that management is in place these are just going to be paper parks.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoOnce designated, these sites will receive new levels of protection which mean decision makers have a legal responsibility to consider the effects of activities on the sites and features."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-help-retrofit-european-homes","story":"Millions of poorly insulated and ventilated homes across northern Europe are now too hot for summers and too cold for winters.As global heating hits, there have already been warnings, from UK Government advisers, that some of Scotlandrsquos houses may kill, because those of us who live in them will be overheated.But homes that are energy inefficient and ill-suited to the new reality of increasingly changeable weather are common throughout the continent.So scientists and engineers are increasingly trying to work out how to retrofit them.The University of Strathclyde is part of an ambitious initiative that will design state-of-the-art factories to support the renovation of  million homes across Europe that must become energy-neutral before .Supported by Interreg North Sea region , the initiative encompasses the areas of Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden that border the North Sea, currently home to around  million people.Focusing on properties built between  and  that must become more sustainable to meet EU energy and climate targets, the project aims to stimulate the European building sector, which does not currently have the necessary production facilities to support this enormous task.Named Indu-zero, the three-year project aims to industrialise housing by creating a blueprint for an autonomous factory that adopts Industry . technologies and can manufacture , refurbishment kits per year.Similar factories will then follow the blueprint across ious European countries.Placed over a house like a jacket, the refurbishment kits feature clever solutions for sustainable energy production and increased comfort of living, such as solar , heat pumps and ventilation.

offers an insight into the extraordinary extent of the Edinburgh familyrsquos influence on Scottish le, from helping to keep those at sea a little safer, to opening river routes and harbour entrances to ease the passage of vessels, and canals and bridges.Indeed, points out Chris Fleet, Map Curator at the National Library of Scotland, while the Stevenson family may be best known for constructing every lighthouse in Scotland, the plans and designs show that element only made up around % of their work.ldquoBy far the greatest proportion of their work was far more mundane but important aspects of infrastructure like harbours, breakwaters, slipways and even railway and canal projects, he says.ldquoBut it was their initial work in early th century on the Bell Rock lighthouse that gave the family massive publicity.The long and dangerous reef lying  miles east of Dundee and on the route for vessels navigating to and from the Firths of Tay and Forth, had been a cause for concern for decades and was linked to the loss of up to six ships every winter ndash and as many as  during one particularly stormy season.However, it was the sinking of HMS York in  with the loss of all hands that sparked calls for a lighthouse to be erected on Bell Rock a daring proposal given the surface of the rock typically lies under ft of water, emerging only at low tide.Glasgow-born Robert Stevenson had already worked as an apprentice to his step-father Thomas Smith, a lamp-maker appointed by the new Northern Lighthouse Board to construct and manage four lighthouses.Aged , Stevenson had already left his stamp on the nationrsquos most treacherous stretches of coastline when he completed the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae in the Clyde.He was in his mid-s and had already crafted plans for a Bell Rock lighthouse when the HMS York disaster prompted calls for it to be adopted.In a remarkable feat of endeavour and bravery, workmen defied the crashing waves surrounding the rock to begin their excavation work in .It would take four years of construction before the towerrsquos first beam of light shone ndash alerting countless sailors down the years to the risk and saving innumerable lives in the process.The m tall white and black lighthouse remains the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse, although its keepers moved out in  and its light is now operated from the Northern Lighthouse Board offices at  George Street ndash a short distance from the New Town where the Stevenson family made their base.Robert Stevenson went on to serve for nearly  years as engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board, overseeing the construction and improvements to lighthouses from Sumburgh Head in Shetland, to Barra Head at the southern entrance to The Minch and Scotlandrsquos southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway.His talent for civil engineering ran in the family: his sons, Alan, David and Thomas ndash father of Robert Louis Stevenson ndash would go on to follow in his footsteps.The brothersrsquo lighthouses stretch from the most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles at Muckle Flugga on the Island of Unst ndash  years old and still going strong - to the equally curiously named Chicken House lighthouse on an isolated rocky island at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.At the most isolated, Sule Skerry,  miles west of Orkney and designed to aid the passage of vessels through the Pentland Firth to and from the Iceland seas, keepers would spend a lonely month at a time with just seals, puffins and crashing waves for company.Perhaps the most challenging, however, was the construction of Skerryvore lighthouse. The graceful tower designed by Alan Stevenson is the tallest lighthouse in the country, measuring m of solid granite which were quarried on the Island of Mull throughout its six years of construction.Huge blocks of stone were ferried by tender to Hynish on Tiree to be dressed and shaped to ensure they fitted perfectly into place, before being taken to the site overlooking a reef of treacherous rocks around  miles south west of the island.The family firm was eventually passed to Davidrsquos sons, David Alan and Charles, in the s, and grandson, Charles.But while they continued to specialise in lighthouse design until the s ndash including lighthouses as far afield as New Zealand and Japan, the family also undertook a wide iety of work which helped transform travel and improve infrastructure.Mr Fleet points out that the maps and plans held by the Library show not only the remarkable attention to detail and vision of each designer, but in some cases the changing face of the locations such as harbours which were redesigned to make them safer and easier to navigate, rivers where work was carried out help improve the flow, and roads, bridges and canals which opened swathes of the nation to economic development.However, perhaps the biggest impact of their work is missing from the collection of maps, plans and documents: the countless lives their engineering skills saved.Mike Bullock, Chief Executive of the Northern Lighthouse Board said: ldquoFor over  years Robert Stevenson and his descendants designed and built the majority of Scotlandrsquos Lighthouses.ldquoThey constructed wonders of engineering that have withstood the test of time and the elements.ldquoYou only have to look at Robert Stevensonrsquos Bell Rock Lighthouse, which since  has been continuously safeguarding ships and the lives of their crews and passengers, to recognise their remarkable contribution to our

Carlaw, the partyrsquos deputy leader, agreed to step up on an interim basis until the contest is called.It is understood that the key issue for the Scottish Tories over the next few months will be on whether the party should either split from the UK party or become more autonomous.Davidson won the leadership in  after defeating this proposal, which had been suggested by rival Murdo Fraser.However, senior party figures believe times have changed and a majority of Tory MSPs, as well as a big majority of shadow cabinet members, are said to back a rethink of the relationship with the UK party.Fraser and Adam Tomkins, the partyrsquos shadow constitution secretary, are on the record voicing their support for a revised structure. There is no preferred model, but advocates of change are attracted to setting up a new party purely for Holyrood elections.In comments reported yesterday, Carlaw shot down the idea of a debate.ldquoI just donrsquot think an introspective debate of that character is going to impress people when there are huge issues facing the country, he said.ldquoI do believe we have that independence to develop our own political agenda on devolved issues.

It is fundamentally not his place to make this decision as interim leader. He has been told he cannot make rulings on issues such as this.Supporters of changing the relationship with the UK party want an internal review to examine a range of options, rather than allowing the issue to dominate a leadership contest.The MSP continued: ldquoHaving a review before the contest makes a lot of sense. We are now in a situation where a majority of our parliamentarians in Scotland are willing to explore other models for the structure of the party, and it would be dficult to conduct that debate within the heat of a leadership contest.A second MSP said: ldquoI am in favour of having another structure and we should have a review or a commission report back before the contest. It would look at the pros and cons of all the dferent models.The parliamentarian said the change was not related to Johnson becoming Prime Minister, but it was essential nonetheless. ldquoIt is necessary because there is a growing sense that devolution requires a bespoke party to deal with devolved issues. Scottish politics has been so ided that we need our own voice.A third MSP said: ldquoIt would be f****** stupid not to be talking about this.Potential leadership contenders include MSPs Carlaw, Fraser, Tomkins, Donald Cameron, Dean Lockhart, Miles Briggs, Liam Kerr and Michelle Ballantyne.

Paul has been discussing, as have Lesley [Laird, MP] and others, future arrangements which the party will obviously be considering.

But, as a populist hard-right Brexit looms, the Glasgow MSP also admits the right have been better than the left at turning despair into votes.The Scottish Greens have chosen an old printworks, Civic House, just under the M flyover at Cowcaddens, to unveil their plan, the first working of what they aim will one day turn in to a programme of government.This venue, home to a vegan canteen and work spaces, is now community owned. Its distressed brick walls smell of wet cement. ldquoHope is hard work these days, Harvie says after stepping away from his podium. ldquoJust look around the world at the climate emergency.ldquoOur generation is being given a stern lecture by young people who are rightly angry at the way their world is being trashed.

The new UK Government ndash ldquothe most far-right in modern history, he says ndash is a major source of anger too.Before his speech, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had just announced that he intends to suspend the House of Commons.

It is about wrenching us from an economic model ndash which we criticise and want to improve ndash towards something far worse, something closer to the US.How did it get to this  How did the UK come to be careering towards what Harvie calls ldquodisaster capitalism ldquoI think the right are better at exploiting a crisis than the left are, he says. ldquoTen-plus years ago, when you had a financial crisis, it was created by that centre-right, deregulated, free-market, neoliberal model which could never last, by debt-fuelled casino capitalism.ldquoI am afraid the right have been more effective at exploiting that crisis and the left have not.ldquoNot just the Greens but the left generally need to get better at connecting with people who feel failed, because they have been been failed.ldquoItrsquos not an original observation but populism is offering people  solutions to real problems.ldquoPeople have a right to be angry. But the privatisation of their assets is a far bigger cause of the left-behindness that a lot of people experience than membership of the European Union.How did the EU end up being the focus of anger of those who suffered after the crash ldquoPeople have been subjected to years of propaganda, Harvie says. ldquoNot from all of the media, butyou read a lot of the tabloid media, some of the biggest-selling papers in the UK, you would have a wildly distorted view of what the EU is and what it does.The Scottish Greens co-leader has had his disagreements with the EU.ldquoEurope has been bad at trying to connect with people about why membership of a greater union is a positive thing, he says. ldquoIf the UK behaved in anything like as modern and democratic manner as the EU, I might not even want to leave it.ldquoThe UK is riddled with anachronism and privilege and the embedded power of the City of London.After Johnsonrsquos prorogation gambit First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said independence is now ldquocompletely inevitable.Harvie is not so sure. ldquoNothing is completely inevitable. Hope is hardwork these days. I think itrsquos really encouraging that people are still willing to say Scotland does not need to be locked into a political landscape we donrsquot feel part of.Andindependence fails to materialise  ldquoIf it does not happen, we will see another wave of disillusionment and disengagement, of more people being left behind, Harvie reckons.ldquoOur job is to do our very best to make sure peoplersquos anger is channelled into something constructive, into something positive. Not to deny people have been failed but to identy who has failed them ndash the right wing.And this, for Scottish Greens, is where the Green New Deal comes in.

Its thrust: repurposing the public sector to make Scotland greener and fairer redirecting agricultural subsidies to help green farming and forestry using the embryonic Scottish National Investment Bank to support clean manufacturing.ldquoThere are things we can do right now, even within the constraints of the UK, to reconnect people with the power that comes from community, from local creativity, says Harvie.ldquoWe are human beings.

Any move to ignore an act of Parliament would be a full-blown attack on our constitution.\"It is staggering that in the same interview, Michael Gove admitted that the no-deal Brexit the Government is attempting to ram through will hit peoplersquos living standards with increased food prices.ldquoThis is a price that Boris Johnson is willing to pay because it wonrsquot be him and his wealthy friends paying it but ordinary families already struggling after nine years of austerity.Mr Trickett added: \"It is the people, not an unelected prime minister in hock to the vested interests of the richest, who should determine our countryrsquos future.\"Pete Wishart for the SNP said: \"The Tories are jumping up the dictatorial scale at an alarming rate, bounding from plans to suspend Parliament and now refusing to saythey will abide by the law. It is clear that this governmentrsquos gone rogue.ldquoHow anyone can have a shred of confidence in this hapless boorach is utterly astounding - no one is above the law, and for Boris Johnsonrsquos government to act like they are is genuinely terrying for our democracy,\" added the Perth MP.Guto Bebb, the former Conservative minister, said the Governmentrsquos ldquounprecedented willingness to flout the rules is a disgrace to our democracy.The Welsh backbencher went on: ldquoNot only are they suspending Parliament to try and force through a disastrous no-deal but now they are suggesting that, evenParliament passed a law requiring the Government to avoid no-deal, they might simply ignore it.ldquoOur very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government, claimed Mr Bebb.He said Mr Gove had recently admitted that no-deal was not what he had campaigned for in  but that he was now ldquowilling to tear up our democratic system to force this outcome on the country against the wishes of both Parliament and the public.Mr Bebb, on behalf of the Peoplersquos Vote campaign, added: ldquoThe Brexiters in Government like to cloak themselves in the language of democracy but they willingly ignore basic democratic principles as and when it suits them.ldquoThe British people should not and will not stand for it. Its no wonder the outrage and protests across the UK are growing larger all the time. The British people believe in democracy and fair play and the only way to resolve the Brexit crisis is to give them the final say.Meanwhile, David Gauke, the former Justice Secretary and a leading Tory rebel, made clear he would be prepared to give up the Conservative whip to block a no-deal in the national interest.He told Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ldquoIf it is the position now that defying the whip on a European vote is a matter that you lose the whip from the Conservative party, then there are quite a lot of Conservative MPs who over the recent months would have lost the whip.ldquoBut sometimes there is a point where you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest and the national interest has to come first. But I hope it doesnrsquot come to that. I hope cooler and calmer heads will look at this and think that trying to split the Conservative Party in this way is not a sensible way forward for the Conservative Party, or indeed for the country,\" he added.It has been suggested that as many as  Tory rebels are prepared to defy Mr Johnson and vote to block a no-deal outcome.On Monday, Mr Gauke and former Cabinet ministers are set to have their own private showdown with the PM in Downing St.\"I want to hear from him as to what is his plan to deliver a deal. When are we putting forward proposals to deal with this backstop issue  And I want to hear how he plans to deliver the legislationwe get a deal by October , because at the moment, frankly, I cant see how hes got time to do that,\" said Mr Gauke.Reports suggested that any Tory MP who defies the Government could see their candidacy withdrawn in the event of a snap general election. No  made clear ldquoall options for party management are under consideration.International Development Secretary Alok Sharma told Tory rebels to be \"clear whose side you are on\".In a warning to Conservative colleagues who are considering joining Opposition attempts to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit, Mr Sharma said they needed to \"stand with the people\" and deliver Brexit.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Sharma said: \"You need to be very clear whose side you are on.\"On Marr, Mr Gove was pressed on whether or not there would be shortages of fresh food as a result of a no-deal Brexit. He replied: \"Everyone will have the food they need,\" and then added: \"No, there will be no shortages of fresh food.\"Askedfood prices would increase, the Scot replied: \"There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.\"Elsewhere, Labourrsquos John McDonnell said Mr Johnson and his government were \"insulting the intelligence of the British people\" in their explanation for suspending Parliament for up to five weeks until mid-October.Describing the Tory leader as behaving like a ldquodictator, the Shadow Chancellor declared: \"Just because a Prime Minister is worried that theyll lose a vote in Parliament, to then use the tactic of closing down Parliament, in our parliamentary democracy, is unacceptable.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-launches-100m-39-get-ready-brexit-39-ad-campaign","story":"The campaign, estimated to cost pound million, will run across television, social media, billboards and other s.

This campaign will encourage the country to come together to Get Ready for Brexit on October .The Cabinet Office explained that not only UK citizens intending to travel to Europe and all exporters to the EU would be targeted but also groups requiring particular information such as the equine industry and legal professions.Key actions include:*acquiring an Economic Operator Registration and Identication number to export to the EU - businesses that are VAT registered will automatically be issued an EORI number but micro businesses still need to register themselves*obtaining the correct documents to transport goods at the border and*applying for the vital support packages available for businesses such as grants.The Cabinet Office said advertising accompanied with targeted road-shows and events would drive people to GOV.UK, which has a new checker tool so audiences can identy what they need to do to get ready for Brexit quickly.It added that there would be ldquohow to videos and step by step guides, so that actions people needed to take to prepare would be ldquoclear and simple."},{"url":null,"title":"20 of the most unusual baby names chosen in 2018","story":"These are some of the most unusual baby names parents in England and Wales named their children in , according to the Office for National Statistics data..

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Traffic-calming measures will run in tandem with the part-time  zone outside Kintore Primary School\"  Councillors make policy change to improve Kintore School safetyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"sinclairs sign up to support run garioch","story":"Sinclairs Jewellers of Inverurie has joined Dandara, Accord Energy, Ferguson Group, CPCo. and Thainstone Events to become Run Garioch#s latest main sponsor.As part of the family-run business’ th anniversary celebrations in , Sinclairs will be making a substantial contribution towards the cost of chip timing for the event that takes place on Sunday, March , next year.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the afternoon, of course, Tarantino#s latest, which I#d marked down as a #marquee event# in my own head having completed thorough due diligence on the Rotten Tomatoes film site.Careful planning went into this operation. First off, cinema times had to be checked, with the .pm showing being selected to minimise the risk of other folk turning up. As the French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said, “Hell is other People” – reportedly after going to a night time showing of Fast and Furious at the Odeon Cinema in the Fe Retail Park – so I was leaving nothing to chance. Jean Paul knew his onions.Next up, a quarter of Sports Mixture and a can of diet coke were purchased from the local ice-cream shop, the original Sports Mixture not the softer version, with the black liquorice slotting into the number ten role behind the main strikers. After paying a very reasonable £. for a premium seat and saving myself around £ on Pick’n’Mix, I sat through  minutes of adverts, paralysed with fear at the thought of a nacho-munching couple, armed to the teeth with buckets of fat coke, deciding to sit within, or on the fringes of, the five row exclusion-zone I’d created. Thoughts of Thatcher and the Belgrano were put to one side and three trips to the lavvy later, my pee-game was tight and I settled in for the feature presentation. The only downer was that I’d eaten all the Sports Mixture and drank the diet coke before the start but I got over the crushing sense of disappointment and made a mental note to “keep some sweets for the film in future”.The movie itself was bang average but it had Brad Pitt in it so the time passed smoothly enough, evenTarantino forgot to include a script – there’s an hour where nothing very much happens – and the ending is ridiculous.Cheers for that Barry Norman – Film  beckons. This got me thinking about great movie stars and how they dfer from other actors who mostly ply their trade on television and in the theatre. It’s not spoken about as much these days, and “star vehicle” seems like an old-fashioned term, but leading men like Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio can pretty much carry any film to success at the box office. Two things are required: a they have to be exceptionally good looking and b we can’t know, or at least remember, too much about their personal lives.Acting ability is important but the real greats understand that doing as little as possible on screen while maintaining a stillness works best. Brando knew this and was lauded for it even when the film was a bit ropey. Of course, I’m talking exclusively about men here.Things are still much harder for women actors despite the #MeToo movement attacking the Hollywood casting system. The term “leading lady” to complement the male star is hopefully redundant but there are still fewer opportunities for women to look cool and very few are given the chance to have their names appear above the title. Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep are the only two female actors I can think of in the last  years who have rivalled male stars in terms of box-office power. Things only appear to be getting better – sure, there are lots of great actors out there like Emma Stone and Kristen Stewart, but no-one yet has the clout of a Foster or a Streep. Perhaps they never will and those days are gone, with a slew of female actors doomed to stay at the same, albeit top, level, having to compete for parts.One of the things I like about Brad Pitt is that he seems fairly normal. You don’t hear horror stories about him being dficult to work with and I imagine he’s the sort of person who doesn’t order off-menu when he goes out to eat. No egg white omelettes for him.I’d like to think he likes a medium-rare steak with chips, or French fries as he probably calls them, and isn’t on a constant diet like most actors – but I’m probably being too kind. I do know he was married to that nice Rachel from Friends, then cheated on her with Angelina Jolie, married her, then got orced again and now has  kids to look after, but that’s no dferent from wee Bert who drives the fish van in Lochgelly. No doubt Brad has made a few stinkers in his time, Troy and The Devil’s Own where he played an “Oirish” republican terrorist to name two, but his movie choices in the last few years have been pretty much flawless and his IMDb filmography ranks among the best. This talk of choices brings me onto the tricky subject of Robert De Niro, or Bobby as I like to call him.His choices have been dreadful for well over ten years now and he’s in danger of ruining his legacy. I’m not loving the stuff he did for Warburtons bagels and the new Kia Niro car advert with a “hilarious” play on his name is downright painful, which makes me questionhe ever was making his own choices on scripts. I know some people don’t mind these shameless earners, and obviously he still gets a pass because he’s Bobby, but it’s hard to watch his classics knowing how the movie of his le has panned out. It’s getting to be like he’s a character out of one of his own films – a down at heel Jake la Motta, or worse still, wannabe comedian Rupert Pupkin from Martin Scorsese classic The King of Comedy. Who knows, maybe his best mate Scorsese has rode in again to save the day with the forthcoming The Irishman... but I wouldn’t bet a quarter of Sports Mixture on it.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"we must hold our nerve amid turbulent times john mclellan","story":"Ruth Davidson#s departure raises questions about a London-Scotland ide, writes John McLellanRuth Davidson wouldn’t have got baby Finn down to sleep on Thursday night by the time several newspapers were preparing front pages speculating about the Scottish Conservatives breaking away from the UK party to create some sort of Quebec-Baia-Ruritania arrangement or whatever it might be.Although the precise timing and the handover procedures were not finalised until early last week, those closest to her have known for some time that her resignation was coming, in all probability before the start of the new parliamentary session next week. There had been a possibility she would remain in post until a new leader was elected, but having done such a good job during her maternity leave and retaining his enthusiasm for stepping up to the plate, a caretaker arrangement under deputy leader Jackson Carlaw made sense as long as he was not one of the candidates as he had been in .Given the relationship with London was the key iding line between her and Murdo Fraser in that contest, it’s inevitable that it will be raised again against the background of the  per cent Remain vote in Scotland and the furore over No Deal. But while journalists are certainly entitled to ask the questions and for commentators to guess away, the number one question for the party’s senior elected representatives and officials is whether it serves their overarching interests to fuel that debate when so much  is uncertain Maybe discussing anything but Brexit is a happy distraction for some, but as the preservation of the United Kingdom remains the absolute priority for Scottish Conservatives the response to the question should be another question to what extent would separating the party advance its interests when it is likely to be arguing for the maintenance of a much bigger union for the foreseeable future Insiders are already speculating that the contest could be a face-off between Adam Tomkins and Murdo Fraser, in which case a debate about a split could easily become not one ofbut how. And the reaction in the world beyond the party membership, will be “who cares ”Now the succession won’t be decided until the end of the year, no chance of a second independence referendum before the  Scottish elections but the strong probability of an election in early November, what matters is how the party responds to unfolding events.As Ruth’s leadership moved into its final phase after her triumphantat the Scottish party conference in May, events in London dictated that the focus in Scotland would be on how she played the UK leadership election and the fast-changing Brexit situation. Apart from resolutely backing Anyone But Boris, it was her equally resolute opposition to No Deal which was clearly storing up problems and from the outside it seemed like she was needlessly boxing herself into a corner.There was an opportunity to use the summer to pivot away to a new position behind the direction of the UK Government, one which recognised that successful negotiations with the EU to find a new deal she would support relied on the possibility of a No Deal Brexit and an absolute deadline.As someone who always valued loyalty, she would fully appreciate the need for the Scottish leader to support the national position – and she had abandoned her opposition to more devolution for the Scottish Parliament when it was expedient to do so – it looked to me like she was laying the foundations for her own exit. After eight years of arguing, debating, negotiating, manoeuvring, leafleting, canvassing , fund-raising dinners far from home and, of course, the abuse, with priorities changed utterly by the arrival of her son her heart wasn’t in it.That her loyal resignation speech was graceful in the true sense of the word and supportive of Mr Johnson, suggested she recognises the opportunity is there, but it is up to someone  to take it. Polling estimates put support for Brexit in Scotland at over a million, which is a million voters who now have nowhere to go except the Conservative Party. Yes, many of them are right-of-centre Nationalists, but they are people who are willing to put their opposition to the UK on hold while the ties with Brussels are loosened and will not vote SNP while its clear policy is to take Scotland straight back into the EU.The Shetland by-election result demonstrated that although the SNP threw the kitchen sink and all other available appliances at the campaign and increased its vote share by . per cent, the Lib Dems still held on by nearly , votes. The real story of the night was Labour’s miserable sixth place. The once all-conquering people’s party managed just  votes, down from  in  and putting it in Monster Raving Loony Party territory. Admittedly the Conservative vote was only , but that was an increase of  on  when the Ruth Davidson factor was at full strength and the woefully dispiriting May years were yet to come. But with a seemingly unpopular prime minister, the proroguing of Parliament and the announcement of the popular Scottish leader’s resignation, the Conservative vote went up. And yet senior Scottish party figures are saying the only way forward is a new party  OK, Shetland is not a normal seat and the electorate is small, but such up-to-date evidence as we have suggests otherwise.As Ruth said on the eve of the  referendum, Scottish Conservatives have got to hold their nerve. After three years in which the Commons has singularly failed to come up with anything other than opposition to everything, Prime Minister Johnson’s cutting of the Gordian Knot, as he might put it, to slash the parliamentary timetable is a dramatic but legal means to bring matters to a head. Remainer ultras like Speaker John Bercow have twisted convention and procedure to their own advantage and are squealing like suckling pigs now they are on the end of a similar approach.I may be wrong, but the unwillingness of Lord Doherty in the Court of Session yesterday to grant an interim interdict before a hearing on Tuesday suggests the courts will rule the suspension of parliament is a legitimate political move and not a matter for judicial intervention. This is the Brexit endgame and the playing field will be that little bit more level come November.“There’s a lot to be said for strong leadership,” said a senior political figure to me recently in very hushed tones, followed quickly by “and that was off the record.” Because that person was an ex-Labour cabinet minister.Conservatives and Unionists just need to keep the heid.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit michael gove s claim fresh food unaffected in no deal scenario categorically untrue","story":"The trade body for UK retailers has said it is #categorically untrue# that fresh food supplies would be unaffected in a no-deal Brexit scenario.Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for the Government’s no-deal preparations, said “there will be no shortages of fresh food”the UK leaves the EU without a deal.Responding to the claims made by Mr Gove on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, a spokesman for the British Retail Consortiumsaid it is “impossible to mitigate it fully as neither retailers nor consumers can stockpile fresh foods”.Pressed on whether there would be shortages of fresh food as a result of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Gove said: “Everyone will have the food they need.”Askedfood prices would increase, Mr Gove said: “I think that there are a number of economic factors in play.“Some prices may go up.

After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car. He had no idea what was going on. “We got him out of the car and pushed it off the road. We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38453974.ece/4d97d/BINARY/819PM1%20-%200006%202.jpg","title":"air waves portrush","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.“We want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship.“But that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, andthe UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.”On Boris Johnson’s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Mr Coveney said: “I’m surehe wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be okay with that.“Michel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that’s ready to go.“We all want to get a deal but at the moment nothing credible has come from the British Government in the context of an alternative to the backstop.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Coveney said Michel Barnier and his team of Brexit negotiators are willing to dedicate their time to finding a deal “If that changes, great. We’ll look at it in Dublin but more importantly it can be the basis of a discussion in Brussels, but it’s got to be credible.“It can’t simply be this notion that ‘look we must have the backstop removed and we’ll solve this problem in the future negotiation, without any credible way of doing that’. That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort. Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"editors viewpoint mccords legal bid to reverse prorogation of parliament not most effective way to show displeasure at politicians","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Allister claims that each application may have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. He is seeking from Peter May, the permanent secretary in the Department of Justice, a list of the occasions on which Mr McCord has been granted civil legal aid, the subject of inidual proceedings, and the annual amount of legal aid spent on each.Currently, the annual cost of legal aid in Northern Ireland is more than £.m, and some £.m of this is spent on civil cases such as Mr McCords applications.There is no doubting his record as a campaigner. Acting almost single-handedly, he exposed the UVF terrorist gang in north Belfast that murdered his son Raymond jnr in .However, his current reinvention of himself as a legal champion of the Good Friday Agreement, and anything which challenges it, risks confusing the properly separate roles of the legislative branch and the judiciary.Indubitably, politicians decisions must always be reviewable by the courts. However, it should be a general principle that political decisions are taken by politicians, and that the courts become involved only as a last resort, when some fundamental principle becomes involved.Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court Justice, underlined this in his BBC Reith lectures this year during which he claimed that the law - and especially the expanding human rights law - was filling the public space which was formerly the preserve of politicians.

He said its aim was to manage the \"unique\" risks the UKs departure created for Northern Ireland.Mr Barnier also said it would be a surprise to himmany people in the UK thought blame lay with the EUthe UK crashed out without a deal. He repeated that should the UK crash out without a deal, the same obstacles would remain and the EU would be forced to protect its interests.He wrote: \"It is not about changing the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. That is none of the EU’s business, as it is the Good Friday Agreement – an agreement between the British and Irish governments and political parties in Northern Ireland – that settles how Northern Ireland should be governed.\"The backstop provides Northern Ireland with the economic benefits of the single market for goods.He said the backstop \"fully respects the carefully negotiated balance found in that agreement between the competing political views and dferent identities in Northern Ireland\".\"Its objective is simply to have an insurance policy in place that guarantees that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remains fully open, and that the status quo of cross-border exchanges on the island of Ireland is maintained.\"At the UK’s request, we agreed to have a UK-wide customs dimension to that backstop.\"Mr Barnier said intense discussions among the  EU member states were had on maintaining the integrity of the single market while allowing for an open border on the island or Ireland. He said the backstop offered the \"maximum flexibility\" to a non EU member.\"The backstop provides Northern Ireland with the economic benefits of the single market for goods, which the EU is exceptionally willing to offer due to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. I believe that the people of Northern Ireland recognise and appreciate this offer more than Westminster does for now.\"Alliance welcomed the comments. Deputy leader Stephen Farry said those thinking the EU would change their position at the th hour were \"deluding themselves\".He said: \"Dangerous decisions are taken by those who believe their own propaganda. The room for negotiation lies around the Political Declaration or reverting from the UK-wide backstop to a Northern Ireland-only mechanism.“The backstop is much more than just avoiding aof a hard border – a point seemingly lost on those seeking to devise alternative arrangements.“As the grandstanding and dishonesty of the current Johnson administration deepens, the case for the backstop is reinforced.

He said the outstanding matters of the Irish border, citizens rights and the financial settlement would still need to be addressed.\"The EU cannot prevent the UK from choosing a no-deal’ scenario. I would fail to understand the logic of that choice though, as we would still need to solve the same problems  after October .\"Many people in the UK understand that and I would be surprisedthey succumb to the idea that the EU is to blame for a dficult political situation in the UK.\"Boris Johnson meanwhile has spoken of “signs of progress” in Brexit discussions.The prime minister restated his case for a harder Brexit, telling The Sunday Times the country needed to “come out of the incarceration of the backstop”.He added: “Everybody understands what is wrong with the current withdrawal agreement: it keeps the UK locked into the EU. It means they can boss us around on trade policy or on how we legislate forever.”The interventions from both sides come ahead of another pivotal week in the Commons and an expected clash on the green benches when opponents of no deal look set to try to seize control of the parliamentary agenda to push through legislation delaying Brexit beyond October ."},{"url":null,"title":"baby monkey born at london zoo named after astronaut buzz aldrin","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy.

Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to .. Employees A total of , people are employed by Northern Ireland’s Top  Companies, a decrease from , employed by the companies in the  listing. Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee. Location Since the inception of the Top  we have periodically looked at the geographic location of the companies within Northern Ireland – historically the east of the province has held sway over the west – however, we are beginning to see a sht with currently  businesses based in Belfast, Co Antrim and Co Down, with Co Tyrone being a major recipient of Top  activity. Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies. NOTES A date of the June ,  has been used as the cut-off for the filing of accounts for the inclusion in this year’s Ulster Business Top .

Short Brothers files in dollars, while KN Networks Ltd and Lakeland Dairies Ltd files in euros. To allow for fair comparison their financial results have been amended to reflect the currency value at their financial year-end. .

The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
