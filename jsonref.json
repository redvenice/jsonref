Experts think so. Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that.’When she was just eight, Sky was the youngest competitor in the Vans U.S. Open, and placed higher on the leaderboard than women 20 years her senior. This year, she won gold at Simple Session, a women’s contest in Estonia. The course had been designed for men twice her size.         Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that\u0027Today’s venue — a skate park in Salford, Greater Manchester — is pretty much Sky’s UK ‘home’. She certainly seems at ease here.One minute we are standing together at the edge of an 8ft drop, talking about her favourite pop stars, the next she has tipped her board off the side and disappeared. No helmet. No knee pads. Argh!‘This is the thing we have most arguments about,’ says her dad. ‘She hates the pads, so we don’t make her wear them for bowls this size — but we do for bigger ones, and when she’s on concrete. We’ve said that if she breaks a bone, we may reconsider.’Off she goes, arms out, body bending, sun-bleached hair billowing behind. She swooshes up the other side of the bowl, coming right over the edge, and flips her body upside down. Afterwards, she’s grinning ear to ear.What does it feel like? ‘Like I’m flying,’ she says. ‘The minute I stop, I want to do it again, but higher.’         Her father Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And anotherDo skateboarding prodigies exist? Well, Sky did develop the skills early. Perhaps some of it was in the genes.Before she was born, her father was a passionate and committed surfer. He admits that when his Japanese wife Meiko gave birth to Sky, he thought those days were over.‘My attitude to risk changed when I became a dad,’ he says. ‘It seems weird now, given how things have turned out, but when I knew I was having a girl, I thought she’d want to do things with her mum. I never imagined she would be into the same things as I was.‘She’s taught me a lot about gender equality — about everything.’ He had a tiny tornado on his hands. When he tried to wrap her in cotton wool, she broke through.‘She was fearless. She’d say: “Higher, Daddy, again.” Sky could surf pretty much before she could walk. She still surfs every morning.’The fact that their house is on the beach helps. ‘School starts at 7.30am so I have to get up at 5,’ Sky says. ‘Ocean and I run down the beach. When Dad tells us it’s time to get ready for school, we say: “Just one more wave!” ’They surf on their own? Stu nods. ‘They know what they’re doing. It’s natural for them.’There are shared skills between surfing and skateboarding, and they’ll both be making their Olympic debuts at the Tokyo games. And guess what? Sky hopes to qualify for the GB surfing team, too. ‘Two medals would be good,’ she admits. ‘I’d like to win, yes, but even if I don’t, it doesn’t matter. I just do it because it’s fun.’ Is she ever afraid? ‘Yes, but I want to beat it,’ she says. ‘And if you fall, you just get up again.’And it’s not just sport. She will try anything, especially if there is a competition involved. ‘She and her brother will see who can eat the spiciest chilli,’ says Stu.What’s the most adventurous thing she has eaten? ‘Tarantula,’ Sky says. ‘We were in Cambodia and they have restaurants that serve crickets and all sorts of insects — and tarantula. Someone said: “Would you like to try it?” and I said: “Why not?” ’Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And another.The family were asked to get involved with skateboarding charities. Sky developed a taste for mentoring, it seems, and was happy to try her hand at being a feminist icon, too.‘Why should the boys have all the fun? I’ve been to Cambodia to teach children who have never skateboarded before. It was amazing. I said to the girls: “Just try it. You can do it.” ’ When she first pitched up at contests, she admits the men raised their eyebrows. ‘Then they started crowding round to watch and I was like: “Yeeeeesss!” I want to show them that girls can do anything boys can do.’In the space of just a few short years she has amassed an extraordinary fan base. She was seven when she got her first sponsorship deal, but the big sporting juggernauts have started to take note. She recently signed a deal with Nike, which meant her image was emblazoned on posters all over the U.S.All the attention has thrilled and alarmed her parents in equal measure.‘We are nervous about putting too much pressure on her, and it becoming more than just fun for her,’ admits Stu. He isn’t specific about how much money she has made, but it sounds as if her parents are determined that she is sensible about it.‘She self-funds a lot of the charity projects, so she will put money into that, with flights for instance,’ Stu adds. ‘And her merchandising goes 100 per cent to charity. After that, well, money has been put away so that it will help her in the future.’They certainly don’t seem to be limelight seekers. Stu declines to be in our photographs, ‘because this isn’t about me’.Nor is his wife mad keen on the attention. ‘We live in a small village in Japan, and we want to keep it low-key.’That may prove tricky. Last year, Sky won the junior version of the U.S. programme Dancing With The Stars, despite the fact she’d never had a dance class in her life.Stu says that the family were reeling when Sky got the offer, yet Sky insisted she wanted to do it. Why? ‘Because it sounded fun,’ she says.She couldn’t dance but threw herself into training, adapting her somersaults to moves she could do in a sequinned ballgown.While her mum and dad had moved to California for the filming of the show, they hesitated over allowing her to be too much of a media darling. Offers to appear on big chat shows such as Ellen were politely declined.And Sky’s parents were nervous when the idea of her aiming for the Olympics was mooted.‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, because I didn’t want to put too much pressure on her, but Sky said she wanted to do it,’ says Stu.The family set-up is quite unique, but, as a blueprint for creating a future Olympian, it has its merits.The Brown family have a Californian beach vibe going on, but also a rigid Japanese work ethic. ‘Her school is quite strict. They don’t mind her being off if we have to be travelling, but she has to do her homework. That idea of hard work is important.’Sky’s first language is Japanese, but she is also fluent in English, helped by her time in the U.S. She’s very much a global citizen, though. She’s travelled all over the world on sporting and charitable adventures. She has released her own skateboard, with proceeds going to charity, and has so far raised £13,000.Some of her mentoring has happened closer to home. Little Ocean is his sister’s double. They are inseparable and share everything, even a bed.‘He’s my bestie,’ she says, as he joins her on his skateboard, trying to match her every leap.When he takes a tumble — doubtless acquiring another bruise — she pulls him up.‘Let’s go again,’ she says, and they do. Sky Brown (@skybrown) • Instagram photos and videos"},{"url":null,"title":"Little litter heroes lead way Britains biggest Spring Clean","story":"Share this article Waving a litter-picker, she said: ‘I found a hat!

James spends pretty much every waking hour with the koalas, tending them and chatting to them. Even on a rare day off he pops by to photograph them and check everything’s OK.‘It goes beyond love! I would do anything for them,’ he says. Which is a good thing, because koalas need a lot of love.         In the wild in Australia, the koalas are threatened by urbanisation, dingoes, bush fires, drought and heatstrokeDespite never knowingly taxing themselves (in the wild a koala can live its entire life never moving from one eucalyptus tree), they’re prone to illnesses, including a kidney disorder and a virus that affects their immune system. A study has also revealed that 47 per cent suffer from koala chlamydia, which is often inherited.In the wild in their native Australia, they’re also threatened by urbanisation, dingoes, bush fires, drought and heatstroke.But despite all these problems, their appalling eyesight and teeny brains, koalas have been around for more than 25 million years.         Enclosure keeper James Dennis checks Violet\u0027s weightThere are two species — the Northern Koala, smaller with finer fur and endangered and the bigger Southern Koala whose numbers have recovered after being hunted almost to extinction in the Sixties.Both live up to about 15 years in captivity (compared with ten or so in the wild), nurse new-born ‘joeys’ in their pouches for the first six months and are such solitary animals that there’s no collective noun for them. Until this lot came to Longleat last year, there were just three Southern Koalas outside Australia — in Hong Kong and Japan.The journey was two years in the planning, in which government licences had to be obtained and meetings held with Viscount Weymouth (patron of the International Koala Centre of Excellence, which protects koalas in the wild).Longleat’s facilities were inspected twice by officials from Cleland Wildlife Park to ensure they could cope with the koalas’ demands. ‘Very few places can take Southern Koalas,’ says Cleland director Professor Chris Daniels.‘You have to be at the top of your game in animal husbandry. Koalas are incredibly difficult to move because they get easily stressed. And if they become stressed, they stop eating and with that goes their water intake.’It took two full-time staff a year to prepare eight animals for the 47-hour journey. They trained the koalas to move in and out of travelling crates.They simulated the plane’s movement by driving them around in crates in the back of pick-up trucks. Not knowing which type of aircraft they’d be travelling in, they even played recordings of all sorts of aircraft engines, so the koalas wouldn’t panic.         It took two full-time staff a year to train eight koalas to move and out of travelling crates in preparation for the 47-hour journey from Australia‘Koalas have incredibly sensitive hearing, so they would know the difference between one plane and the next,’ says Chris.Eventually, five koalas travelled by cargo jet, accompanied by a veterinary team and three keepers who chatted all the way to keep the animals calm.Not that they needed to — the koalas ate and slept all the way here. On arrival on UK soil, a fleet of Land-Rovers drove them to Longleat to start their new life.Five months on, they look happy and ready to meet human visitors when Koala Creek opens next week.         When the bears arrived on UK soil, a fleet of Land-Rovers drove them to Longleat. Five months later, they look happy and ready to meet human visitors when Koala Creek opens next weekTo me, they all look pretty much the same, sitting in trees on thick, furry, padded bottoms adapted for a life of sloth. But to keeper James, they couldn’t be more different.He identifies them by the unique pink and black patterns inside their enormous nostrils and by their different personalities and peccadilloes.Maizie, he says, is the cuddly one, Dennis is a bolshy teenager full of hormones, Violet is the ‘free spirit’ and Coorong is ‘stubborn’.         Keeper Alessandra Topazio weighs one of the koalas. Longleat staff have to monitor every aspect of the Koalas daily life. The south Australian Koalas are choosing the specific type and even the location of the eucalyptus trees used to provide their daily dietAnd then there was Wilpena.‘She was our best eater, our largest koala,’ says James, suddenly sad. But after six weeks at Longleat she had lost a kilogram (a sixth of her bodyweight) in just seven days. Despite 24-hour care, she suffered a kidney disorder.‘Everyone was here for her final moments,’ says James. ‘We all cried.’It was just awful bad luck.Today, ahead of opening to the public, the keepers are planning koala birthday celebrations (involving eucalyptus treats, naturally) and, hopefully, the pitter-patter of a teeny joey.Because, aged two, Dennis is nearing breeding age and the females know it. They’ve been bellowing at him and flipping their furry ears to get his attention. In return, he’s been flaring his nostrils and looking moderately interested.If he’s a bit reticent, it’s understandable. As Professor Chris Daniels says: ‘Koala love-making is a challenging business — a fairly aggressive activity, and the boy needs to be big and strong if he’s going to get his way . . .’All of which, of course, involves far more effort than this very lazy animal is used to."},{"url":null,"title":"Adam Schiff rejects reports Mueller indictments over","story":"Share this articlePoliticusUSA on Twitter: \u0026quotSen.

Photograph: Odd Roar LangeNTB scanpix via APRescue helicopters have evacuated dozens of people from a luxury cruise ship which suffered engine failure on Saturday in stormy weather off the west coast of Norway, police and rescue workers said.A maritime rescue service said the Viking Sky, with about 1,300 passengers and crew on board, had sent out a mayday signal as it had been drifting towards land.The crew were later able to restart one engine and the ship was at anchor about 2km from land, at Hustadvika. The passengers were considered safe, although the evacuation was set to continue, the rescue service said.Only 87 people had been evacuated by 5.50pm GMT, and the airlift was set to continue throughout the night, rescue service spokeswoman Borghild Eldoen said. Eight of those evacuated had suffered light injuries.Passengers were hoisted one by one from the deck of the vessel and airlifted to a village just north of the city of Molde on Norway’s west coast.Evacuated cruise passengers described the moment when the ship’s engines stopped.“We were having lunch when it began to shake. Window panes were broken and water came in. It was just chaos. The trip on the helicopter, I would rather forget. It was not fun,” American passenger John Curry told public broadcaster NRK.Second vesselA second vessel, a freighter with a crew of nine, was also being evacuated nearby after suffering engine failure, erting helicopters and thus delaying the cruise ship airlift, the rescue centre added.Two purpose-built vessels operated by the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue had been forced to turn back due to the severe weather, the service said.Waves were 6-8m high, with wind blowing at 24 metres per second, according to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The storm was expected to last until at least midnight local time.The stretch of water known as Hustadvika and surrounding areas are known for fierce weather and shallow waters dotted with reefs, and Norway is evaluating whether to build a giant ocean tunnel through a nearby mountain to improve safety in the area.The Viking Sky, built in 2017, belongs to Viking Ocean Cruises, part of the Viking Cruises group founded by Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen. According to the company’s website, its passenger capacity is 930.Several vessels and four helicopters are taking part in the rescue and facilities to receive passengers have been set up on land, the rescue service said.All search and rescue teams in the region are mobilising, including 60 volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross, a spokesman said.Viking’s operational headquarters, located in Basel, Switzerland, did not respond when contacted by telephone. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"juxtaposed jigsaw art pictures","story":"Tim Klein, from Washington, USA, has been creating his surreal mash-ups from jigsaw puzzles since 1993.

The storm has killed hundreds of people and affected more than 2.6 million others with catastrophic damage occurring in and around Beira in southern Mozambique. Was Cyclone Idai caused by climate change?It’s impossible to say if the storm itself was caused by climate change but experts believe its impact was made worse by the gradual rise in temperature.How did climate change make it worse?Experts point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a year’s worth of rain in just a few days - more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, increasing the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges are much more powerful, increasing the risk of the sort of inland flooding seen in the port city of Beira. Sea levels are about a foot higher than a century ago fed by melting ice at the poles.What do the experts say?“Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.What does the future look like for the region?Rebuilding with climate change in mind will be essential. This was not done after the last major cyclone 19 years ago. Roads, housing, utilities should all be built with future storms and flooding in mind.Sounds expensive, can this be done?Ironically, climate change makes future-proofing more difficult as the region’s economy, and therefore its capacity to rebuild, has already been depleted by rising temperatures, drought etc.At the Paris climate summit in 2015, then-prime minister of Mozambique, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, said: “These weather phenomena affect the government’s efforts to meet national priorities, especially food security, that are critical to poverty reduction.”Secretary General of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Elhadj As Sy talks with a survivor of Cyclone Idai, at an evacuation centre in Beira, MozambiqueYes, developed nations, including the UK, are scrambling to send aid and disaster relief teams to the area.The rich nations also pledged in Paris 2015 to ramp up aid to $100 billion per year in restorative climate funding to poorer nations by 2020. This is because industrialisation in the west caused most of the current rise in global temperatures. But so far less than 10 per cent of this funding has been secured.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyUniversities could be stripped of their powers to award degrees Theresa May warned her Government’s failure to introduce hundreds of policies will harm the Conservative’s chances at the next General Election Former MI5 chief warns police and intelligence officers could blame AI for controversial or racist decisionsGrassroot Tories urge Theresa May to set a departure date, warning she is harming the party on the doorstepCabinet ministers must \u0026#39step up\u0026#39 to oust Theresa May in order to rescue BrexitSenior Brexiteers touting Nicky Morgan as potential successor to Theresa MayMedicines will not run out in a no deal Brexit, royal college saysComment: If the Prime Minister doesn\u0026#39t get her deal through next week, she must be prepared to leave without one HS2 should be scapped, says Treasury chief who initially signed off on funding for £56bn rail project5,000 breast cancer sufferers could be spared chemotherapy if offered gene testing, study suggests Dracula to be hero of his own story, say makers of new BBCNetfilx adaptationDonald Trump huddles with closest aides at Mar-a-Lago as he awaits findings of Robert Mueller\u0026#39s reportComment: The UK is strong enough to walk away from these failing EU negotiations. We now need a leader who believes in our countryWhistleblowing NHS worker to challenge NDA in test case for gagging ordersGiraffes must be protected from trophy hunter loophole, campaigners say as Government under pressure to actPeople\u0026#39s Vote campaign accused of \u0026#39overestimating\u0026#39 claims more than one million people attended London marchPolice arrest 70 in \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protests as soldiers deployed to prevent Paris riotingSurprise electoral win leaves far-Right populists scrambling to fill seatsHipster embrace of cassettes fuels demand for magnetic tapeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cyclone idai happens next","story":"A major humanitarian crisis has unfolded in the wake of Cyclone Idai, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

Emergency responders are struggling to reach parts of the three countries after some roads, bridges and communications networks were washed away or destroyed.The city of Beira with its some 500,000 residents is said to be 90 percent destroyed, while some 152 square miles have been flooded. Mozambique\u0027s president, after flying over the region, has warned as many as 1,000 people could die. But further deaths could occur if people clinging to hope are swept away by the rising waters or are not reached in time with critical water, food and other aid.And now authorities are warning of water-borne diseases after what infrastructure existed in the largely impoverished countries was stripped away.What is being done to help?Mozambique and Malawi are two of the poorest countries in Africa, and the economy of once-prosperous Zimbabwe has collapsed in recent years.Aid appeals for millions of dollars have begun as the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations rush to deliver food, water, fuel and medicines to the vast affected area. Tropical Cyclone Idai approaching the Sofala province of Mozambique on 14 March 2019, shortly after reaching its peak intensityThe European Union and Britain have been among the first to pledge aid.

accused cultural colonialism drama set wales dominated english","story":"Larry Lamb and Hayley Mills star in Pitching InThe BBC has been accused of “cultural colonialism” over a new drama which is set in Wales but has an English character at its core.Pitching In stars Larry Lamb as Frank Hardcastle, a widower who runs a caravan park on the North Wales coast. His daughter, played by Caroline Sheen, arrives from England to help out.Both the writers and the director are English, and the supporting cast of Welsh actors are not native to North Wales.The comedy drama begins on Monday as part of BBC One’s new daytime schedule, but was shown in a primetime slot on BBC Wales last month.The verdict was damning, with many viewers complaining that the Welsh characters have accents from South Wales.The leader of Cardiff Council, Huw Thomas, called it “one of the most unfunny, least culturally nuanced TV programmes ever commissioned”.Plaid Cymru’s shadow minister for international affairs and culture Delyth Jewell, said the series is “catastrophic” and set in a version of Anglesey “where the inhabitants for some unfathomable reason seem to have developed Valleys accents”.In an article criticising the series, she claimed that Wales is treated as the poor relation by the BBC, while the corporation has just launched a dedicated channel for Scotland.Ms Jewell wrote: “As licence fee payers in Scotland are treated to a new nine o’clock news programme committed to ‘showing the world through Scottish eyes’ on their new channel, Wales is treated to a sub-standard ‘comedy’ showing Wales through English eyes, inaccurate preconceptions about accents included.“This form of cultural colonialism does a great disservice to Wales. Not only do licence fee payers have to suffer appalling TV that bears no relation to their lived experience, but our incredibly rich pool of creative talent is being shunned.”The drama reduces Wales to “nothing but a lovely background for someone else’s story. No self-respecting nation should be satisfied in playing a bit-part like this,” she added.“Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a good English drama, but in this case we were promised a much needed English-language drama that pertained to the lives of people living in Wales.”The drama reunited Lamb with Melanie Walters, his co-star from the hit BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey, and also features Hayley Mills.Lamb, 71, said during filming for the production: It\u0027s a family comedy drama - but it\u0027s about as far removed from Gavin and Stacey as you can imagine.Gavin and Stacey was set in the far suburbs of London - it was just filmed in Wales in Barry - while Pitching In is all about life on a leisure park in Anglesey.Nick Andrews, head of commissioning for BBC Wales, said: “Pitching In is a comedy drama about family, friendship and community, which will showcase the beauty of North Wales.”This is not the first time a drama has been criticised for failing to accurately represent Welsh people.Netflix series Sex Education came under fire earlier this year for its Americanised characters, despite the show being filmed in South Wales.One bemused social media user commented: I’m very confused by this Sex Education show on Netflix. Why is it an American themed High School in a rural part of Wales?Another joked: It’s like someone at Netflix decided that Sweet Valley High was actually in South Wales.Please review our commenting policyTheresa May warned her Government’s failure to introduce hundreds of policies will harm the Conservative’s chances at the next General Election Former MI5 chief warns police and intelligence officers could blame AI for controversial or racist decisionsGrassroot Tories urge Theresa May to set a departure date, warning she is harming the party on the doorstepCabinet ministers must \u0026#39step up\u0026#39 to oust Theresa May in order to rescue BrexitSenior Brexiteers touting Nicky Morgan as potential successor to Theresa MayMedicines will not run out in a no deal Brexit, royal college saysComment: If the Prime Minister doesn\u0026#39t get her deal through next week, she must be prepared to leave without one HS2 should be scapped, says Treasury chief who initially signed off on funding for £56bn rail project5,000 breast cancer sufferers could be spared chemotherapy if offered gene testing, study suggests Dracula to be hero of his own story, say makers of new BBCNetfilx adaptationDonald Trump huddles with closest aides at Mar-a-Lago as he awaits findings of Robert Mueller\u0026#39s reportWhistleblowing NHS worker to challenge NDA in test case for gagging ordersGiraffes must be protected from trophy hunter loophole, campaigners say as Government under pressure to actComment: The UK is strong enough to walk away from these failing EU negotiations. We now need a leader who believes in our countryPeople\u0026#39s Vote campaign accused of \u0026#39overestimating\u0026#39 claims more than one million people attended London marchPolice arrest 70 in \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protests as soldiers deployed to prevent Paris riotingSurprise electoral win leaves far-Right populists scrambling to fill seatsHipster embrace of cassettes fuels demand for magnetic tapeIsil\u0026#39s caliphate may be defeated but cells\u0026#39 guerrilla tactics point to new deadly threatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/23/TELEMMGLPICT000038252427_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqh-Z8vZIVwyWksZy9KZlIJV7v6b8gFJL3nYUysfuTJAU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dracula hero story say makers new bbcnetfilx adaptation","story":"Dracula by Bram Stoker, the first ever published image of the Count Dracula.Ever since Bram Stoker penned his ever popular Gothic horror novel, Dracula has been one of the genre’s most enduring villains - his exploits terrifying generations of readers and cinema goers alike.Traditionally, little is known about the vampire himself, an obscure figure who remains in the shadows, emerging only to suck the blood of his innocent victims and spread his curse of the undead.But the latest adaptation of the legend now promises to shed new light on Count Dracula, the Transylvanian nobleman whose arrival at the north east port of Whitby sets off a train of grisly events.Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, the writers behind BBC One’s Sherlock, have promised to make Dracula “the hero of his own story” in their forthcoming TV adaptation of the novel.In Stoker’s original novel, published in 1897, Dracula is only ever seen through the eyes of his victims of those trying to vanquish him.Crucially, however, Moffat and Gariss intend to tell the story of the vampire from his own perspective.Old Castle, Banska Stiavnica, Slovakia, where the new Dracula is being filmedGatiss, who has also written several episodes of Doctor Who - including The Unquiet Dead - told The Radio Times: “We sort of made a promise to ourselves and the people who are making it, paying for it, that we’d make Dracula the hero of his own story, and less of a shadowy presence. And that’s a really clever idea, but we had to make good on it!”Moffat, whose writing credits include doctor Who and Jeckyll, BBC One’s adaptation of   Robert Louis Stevenson’s gothic novella The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, added: “There’s lots of things that are challenging about Dracula. Having an evil lead character is actually really difficult.“That’s been the main challenge I think. But how we’ve handled, that you’ll have to wait and see. We quickly found out why he’s often kept a shadowy presence. So it’s hard work, but I think it’s worked. It’s worked well I think, so far.”In a joint statement the pair said: “There have always been stories about great evil. What’s special about Dracula, is that Bram Stoker gave evil its own hero.”Filming on the three-part mini series, jointly produced by the BBC and Netflix, started earlier this month, with the Danish actor Claes Bang starring as Count Dracula.Steven Moffat (left) and Mark Gatiss on the set of DraculaThe writers described their star as “tall, dark and gruesome all at once”, saying Bang is the perfect choice to  “re-introduce the world to Dracula, the vampire who made evil sexy”.Bang, best known for his roles in The Girl in the Spider’s Web, The Affair and Borgen, said last November after being cast for the part: “I’m so excited that I get to dig in to this iconic and super-interesting character. Yes he’s evil, but there’s also so much more to him, he’s charismatic, intelligent, witty and sexy.“I realise that there’s a lot to live up to with all the amazing people that have played him over the years, but I feel so privileged to be taking on this incredible character.”Some of the scenes for the feature-length episodes have been reportedly filmed at the Slovakian city of Banská Štiavnica, where the turreted Old Castle has been used as the backdrop for Count Dracula’s Transylvanian lair.Moffat has said that while they intended to give Dracula the Sherlock make-over he reassured fans of the Victorian setting of Stoker’s novel that he and Gatiss would not be modernising the story.Earlier this month Moffat posted a photograph on Instagram of some of the cast and crew on set, with the caption: “Night has fallen ... it’s a new dawn.”Dracula, which will also star John Heffernan (Collateral, The Crown), Joanna Scanlan (Hold The Sunset, No Offence) and Dolly Wells (Can You Ever Forgive Me), is expected to premiere  later this year or early 2020 on BBC One in the UK and on Netflix in the rest of the world.The set of BBC and Netflix\u0026#39s new version of DraculaUniversities could be stripped of their powers to award degrees Theresa May warned her Government’s failure to introduce hundreds of policies will harm the Conservative’s chances at the next General Election Former MI5 chief warns police and intelligence officers could blame AI for controversial or racist decisionsGrassroot Tories urge Theresa May to set a departure date, warning she is harming the party on the doorstepCabinet ministers must \u0026#39step up\u0026#39 to oust Theresa May in order to rescue BrexitSenior Brexiteers touting Nicky Morgan as potential successor to Theresa MayMedicines will not run out in a no deal Brexit, royal college saysComment: If the Prime Minister doesn\u0026#39t get her deal through next week, she must be prepared to leave without one HS2 should be scapped, says Treasury chief who initially signed off on funding for £56bn rail project5,000 breast cancer sufferers could be spared chemotherapy if offered gene testing, study suggests Donald Trump huddles with closest aides at Mar-a-Lago as he awaits findings of Robert Mueller\u0026#39s reportComment: The UK is strong enough to walk away from these failing EU negotiations. We now need a leader who believes in our countryWhistleblowing NHS worker to challenge NDA in test case for gagging ordersGiraffes must be protected from trophy hunter loophole, campaigners say as Government under pressure to actPeople\u0026#39s Vote campaign accused of \u0026#39overestimating\u0026#39 claims more than one million people attended London marchPolice arrest 70 in \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 protests as soldiers deployed to prevent Paris riotingSurprise electoral win leaves far-Right populists scrambling to fill seatsHipster embrace of cassettes fuels demand for magnetic tapeIsil\u0026#39s caliphate may be defeated but cells\u0026#39 guerrilla tactics point to new deadly threatWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/23/TELEMMGLPICT000192206988_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxGByaeD6X80N28ho092CK4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"helicopters airlift 1300 passengers crew sos cruise ship norwegian","story":"The Viking Sky sent a mayday signal after its engines failed in windy conditionsRescue helicopters evacuated passengers from a cruise ship which suffered engine failure during stormy weather off the coast of Norway.The Viking Sky sent out a mayday signal on Saturday, after it began drifting towards land, prompting a huge evacuation operation.Around 100 passengers and crew were lifted off board by helicopter by late Saturday afternoon and flown to a village just north of the town of Molde, on Norway\u0027s west coast.The ship eventually managed to moor in Hustadsvika Bay, between the western Norwegian cities of Alesund and Trondheim, after the crew were able to restart one engine, said police in the county of Moere og Romsdal.Rescuers warned it would take hours to evacuate all 1,300 passengers and crew on board.If we need to evacuate everyone, it will take a long time, rescue service spokesman Einar Knudsen told Reuters.Two purpose-built vessels operated by the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue had been forced to turn back due to the severe weather, with waves up to 10 metres high and wind blowing at 24 metres per second.At one stage lifeboats were forced to turn back en route to the ship due to the brutal conditions.Later, reports emerged that a cargo ship with nine crew members was in trouble nearby, and the local Norwegian rescue service erted two of the helicopters to that rescue.It was not known last night how many British passengers were on board.

A \u0027final say\u0027 is not what they want - they want to reverse the result.This is a putsch that is going on this week.An effigy of British Prime Minister Theresa May is wheeled through Trafalgar SquareThe protest comes after the European Union agreed to delay the UK\u0027s departure. Meanwhile more than four million people have signed a petition calling on the Government to cancel Brexit.People\u0027s Vote claimed there were so many people at the march that some protesters were at a standstill for \u0027at least an hour\u0027.A spokesperson said: Our estimate is based on professional expert advice and whatever the exact number, there can be no doubt that this ranks as one of the greatest protests - possibly the biggest ever – that this country has ever seen.We have no doubt that this march is bigger than the last with our early estimate putting the size of the crowd at around 1 million.The day\u0027s activities were kicked off by the unfurling of a large banner on Westminster Bridge that read Love socialism, hate Brexit.Brexit | The best comment and analysisMarch attendees included Scotland\u0027s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Labour MP David Lammy and Sherlock Holmes star Eddie Marsan.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called for Article 50 to be revoked, telling crowds: With days to go we\u0027re in danger of falling of the cliff, which will have catastrophic consequences.Ms Sturgeon told protesters that the Prime Minister had pitched parliament against the people.Labour\u0027s deputy leader Tom Watson told the crowd: At every turn we have been ignored. At every stage Theresa May has doubled down rather than reaching out.She has made it impossible for anyone who cares about jobs, about solidarity at home and abroad, about friendship across borders and between communities to support this Brexit.The London march coincided with pro-Brexit campaigners continuing their March To Leave hike from Sunderland to the capital. They hope to arrive on March

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public. It\u0027s past time to go back and clean the skeletons out of the closets. How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right?

Their deaths on Pakistan’s ‘Killer Mountain’\u0026nbspleave a sport reckoning with its own burgeoning popularity, writes Adam WithnallClick to followThe IndependentThe bodies of British climber Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi were found after a two-week searchTom Ballard will never climb Everest. Before his death on Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat was confirmed earlier this month, the prodigious British mountaineer would joke that he had been scaling peaks since before he was born –\u0026nbspin a way, it was what he was born to do.\u0026nbspAged just 30, Ballard already had some extraordinary feats on his climbing resume, foremost among them his record for scaling all six of Europe’s most challenging north faces in a single winter.Ballard’s mother was Anna Hargreaves, the first woman ever to climb Everest solo in 1995 and who, equally famously in the eyes of the press at the time, then died descending K2 the same year, leaving behind a husband, Jim, and two children, Tom and his sister Kate.\u0026nbspShe carried Tom up the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps when she was six months pregnant, and after he was born the family moved to Scotland so Hargreaves could practice on the local crags.The story of how Ballard came to attempt this particular mountain –\u0026nbspthe mountain where his body will remain unless and until a recovery attempt is made –\u0026nbspis as much about his co-climber Daniele Nardi as it is about the way this extraordinary, exhilarating yet occasionally deadly sport has evolved since Ballard’s mother’s own demise.Ballard, 30, and Nardi, 42, were attempting to reach Nanga Parbat’s 8,126m peak via the most direct route, the Mummery Spur. It is an audacious approach, flanked on both sides by towering ice walls that make avalanches a regular occurrence and requiring “mixed climbing” across both ice and rock, a technique beyond even some of the most proficient mountaineers.Created with Sketch.Peaks of Europe Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘Peaks of Europe’ is a photobook by Johan Lolos.

Published by LannooThe dangers and challenges are such that no one has ever successfully taken the Mummery Spur route in winter before. And for Nardi, who had already turned back from four previous attempts at the same expedition, that was the point.\u0026nbspThe Italian was obsessed with the route, says Pakistani climber and tour operator Ali Muhammad, who accompanied Nardi on his 2014-15 attempt but chose to turn back when conditions became too hazardous.In winter this mountain is so dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go – down or upNanga Parbat is known as the “Killer Mountain” for a reason, he tells The Independent. “In winter this mountain is so very dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go –\u0026nbspdown or up. Then we have no choice:\u0026nbspjust hold on until we get better weather.”It was only three years ago, in early 2016, when an international team of climbers made the coveted first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat by any route, leaving K2 as the only mountain above 8,000m anywhere in the world that has yet to be conquered in winter.Muhammad says he understands the urge to conquer a mountain in a way that has never been done before. “Daniele and Tom were trying to make a new history in winter climbing,”\u0026nbsphe says.But the Mummery Spur, he says, is not just one of the hardest ways to summit Nanga Parbat\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit is, in Muhammad’s view, the most difficult unconquered route anywhere in Pakistan, perhaps even the world.Nanga Parbat is seen as a far greater challenge for serious climbers than Everest\u0026nbsp(AP)Simone Mori, the star Italian climber among the group that completed the winter ascent in 2016, has described the Mummery Spur as “suicidal”. “It is ice, rocks, snow, and deep crevasses, and that’s just to reach Camp 2. After Camp 2 there are no crevasses. It is all vertical,” Muhammad says.Nardi and Ballard last made contact with base camp when they were at an altitude of about 6,300m. After a search of almost two weeks, their bodies were found using a high-power telescopic lens by Spanish climber Alex Txikon, another of the successful 2016 ascent team. The families consented to the release of the images, showing two figures and a tent lying close together on a small patch of snow at the bottom of a gully, surrounded by jagged rocks.What changed in the sport of mountaineering between Hargreaves’ generation and that of her son, Ballard, and Nardi? Everest is still Everest, the highest peak on the planet, its height unchanged,\u0026nbspmore or less,\u0026nbspfrom 1995 to 2019.Rather what has changed is our perception of what is humanly possible, argues Jake Meyer, a mountaineer who at the age of 21 years and four months became the youngest Briton to scale Everest in 2005.\u0026nbspHe says that the cultural allure of Everest comes from the fact that it wasn’t climbed at all, that we know of, until Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as late as 1953.The number of climbers worldwideAfter that, the landmarks tumbled:\u0026nbspin 1975, the first woman to reach the summit. In 1978, the first successful climb without supplemental oxygen. In 1980, the first winter summit. All the way to Hargreaves’ own achievement in 1995. To elite climbers, Everest now has little left to offer.Like Ballard, Meyer started climbing when he was young, gaining a degree of competency quickly so that his youth alone was basis enough to set new benchmarks and, almost just as importantly, attract the interest of sponsors to make the expeditions possible.\u0026nbspHe describes a never-ending “arms race” among professional mountaineers to keep pushing the boundaries and achieve things that have never been done before, or at least do them in a way that is new –\u0026nbspplaying with the “semantics”, he calls it.Nanga Parbat is the ninth tallest mountain in the world (AFPGetty)Nardi was keenly aware of this competition, and indeed saw it as integral to the sport. Pakistani mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari quoted him in a tribute after his death by saying: “He always said, ‘A climber is someone who climbs new routes’.”In a modern world of social media and round-the-clock connectivity, that urge to open up new frontiers and explore the world’s last wildernesses may be appealing –\u0026nbspbut it is also one “that has always been there” as a driving force for the great historic mountaineers, Meyer says.The difference now is that with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, hundreds of thousands of fans around the world can follow their favourite climbers’ expeditions in real time.Nardi’s official Facebook page had more than 100,000 followers at the time of his death. The latest updates in the search and rescue operation for the pair were distributed direct to supporters by Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. And Alex Txikon, who has more than 58,000 Facebook followers, shared dramatic photographs and video from the frontline of the search.Alex Honnold, the first solo climber to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan Could this new exposure, and the fact that sponsors pay a lot of attention to mountaineers’ status as modern influencers, be another factor leading them to take greater risks? It’s a question Meyer poses. “Everyone is so aware of what everyone else is doing,” he says. “You have\u0026nbspto be doing bigger, badder, more awesome and, as a result, slightly dangerous things to keep up? I think that if people are treating it like that, then it is a race to the bottom.”If mountaineering and climbing have taken an edgier and more extreme turn in the past 20 years, it isn’t just on new media formats that people are taking notice.\u0026nbspUp until the turn of the century, the sport was considered fodder for low-rent thrillers like Vertical Limit (2000, starring Chris O’Donnell), Cliff Hanger (1993, Sylvester Stallone) and The Eiger Sanction (1975).Something changed around the time of North Face (2008), a critically acclaimed German film about the competition to scale the most dangerous ascent of the Alps. In 2010, 127 Hours about mountaineer Aron Ralston’s fall down a canyon in Utah was runner-up for six Academy Awards.\u0026nbspFinally, this year the suspenseful Free Solo, about Alex Honnold’s successful climb up Yosemite’s El Capitan rock wall without a rope, won the Oscar for best documentary.I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel aliveClimbing is now officially cool –\u0026nbspand there are figures to back up the assumption that young people who might once have been inspired to take up skate- or snowboarding are now turning to their local bouldering gym instead.\u0026nbspIn North America, indoor climbing is set to be a billion-dollar industry by the year 2021, according to the Climbing Wall Association, with a record 43 new climbing gyms opening up across the US in 2017.The International Federation of Sport Climbing estimates 25 million people are climbing regularly worldwide, with the number of young competitors in the UK up 50 per cent in the past five years.\u0026nbspAnd in another landmark for the sport unthinkable a generation ago, sport climbing will feature at the summer Olympic Games for the first time in history next year at Tokyo 2020.Created with Sketch.Jake Meyer: youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right“It’s amazing to see how much it’s changed over my career, and we’re talking 20 years since I watched the new millennium dawn over Kilimanjaro,” Meyer says.\u0026nbsp“It’s incredible, fantastic, and it’s an inspiration.”As the sport’s popularity continues to grow and its elite members keep pushing the limits of what’s possible, a point will be reached where mountaineering must pause and take stock of the element that makes it stand apart from other pursuits – the extraordinary risk to life involved.The Italian climber Mori has been the most outspoken in the community since Ballard and Nardi’s deaths, telling The Times newspaper that “if we continue to say they were just unlucky, the risk is someone will die there next year”.And if the trend continues for increasingly young climbers to seek out the road less travelled, in search of new and more impressive feats, the dangers posed are not just from the mountains themselves.\u0026nbspSearchight)Nowhere is this more evident than with Nanga Parbat. In 2013, a major terrorist attack was launched at the mountain’s base camp, itself a remote outcrop 4,200m above sea level that can only be reached on foot.\u0026nbspThe attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, killed one local guide and 10 international climbers, among them an American-Chinese citizen who was believed to have been the prime target for the gunmen in a kidnapping gone wrong.In 2013 at Nanga\u0026nbspParbat\u0026nbspbasecamp a\u0026nbspterrorist attack by Pakistani Taliban claimed the lives of one guide and 1o international climbersAfter the massacre, the gunmen walked for five hours before eating breakfast at a village and dissipating in the small hours of the morning. An AFP report a year on from the attack suggested most, if not all of the perpetrators remained at large.\u0026nbspThe 2013 attack aside, the Gilgit Pakistan region where most of the country’s biggest mountains lie is generally very safe, far from the restive western border with Afghanistan.Trekkers and climbing enthusiasts are starting to return to the region in larger numbers and can expect encouragement from visa officials and a warm welcome from locals, says Karra Hadri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the sport’s governing body in the country.\u0026nbspHadri, who remembers Ballard from the time when he visited Pakistan as a toddler with his mother and was carried up to K2 base camp on a porter’s back, says last year there were more than 40 major expeditions in Pakistan –\u0026nbspup from just one or two in the years after the 911 attack.The Bigger Red Nose Climb: Charity trek could do with less BallsStray dog follows climbers to become first to reach Himalayan summitWoman becomes first in India to climb ‘men only’ sacred mountainBut he is concerned that growing numbers of young people will come to the country seeking adventure and put their lives in danger. He is calling for a change to the regulations for permits, so that climbers must prove themselves on smaller peaks before attempting any of Pakistan’s five 8,000m-plus summits.“Mountaineering in Pakistan, especially above 8,000m, can be very difficult compared to the rest of the world,” he says. “We still have many mountains that have not been climbed, but youngsters need to know the risks. They should have a lot of skill, a lot of experience, and much budget. And they should go in a group,\u0026nbspnot just one or two alone.”Hadri was closely tracking the progress of the search operation over the past two weeks and was “very sorry to hear” about Nardi and Ballard’s fates. “Tom’s mother was a brave lady,”\u0026nbsphe adds.Ballard is survived by his sister, Kate, who posted a message on Facebook after he went missing thanking people across the world for their “love and thoughts”, and by his girlfriend Stefania Pederiva, who wrote: “I will find you in nature, in the rivers, in the trees, in the mountains, you will always be my most beautiful rock.”Nardi is survived by his wife Daniela and a son Mattia, who is just six months old.\u0026nbspAnd while the sport mourns two of its most promising sons, climbers as a whole are stoic about the risks they take in pursuit of their passion.\u0026nbspMeyer, who last year joined an elite group of only 10 Britons to have scaled K2, says he cannot imagine removing the element of danger from mountaineering,\u0026nbspdespite having, like Nardi, young children at home.“I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel alive,” he says.\u0026nbsp“If you remove the element of risk completely, then what you are left with is almost every other sport. Having children didn’t change my desire to want to go, but what it did was it gave me three times the reasons to come home safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

EU supporters dressed in costumes, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march in central London, They came, young and old, Labour and Tory, by train and by plane, from the four corners of the UK. They came bearing balloons and banners, face paints and flags – and, above all else, smiles and good humour.“Have you ever seen a more polite crowd?” asked Silvia Angelotti, an Italian business analyst who has lived in London for 22 years. “Believe me, a march of a million people in Italy – it is not so calm, not so orderly, I think.”Heseltine says PM’s No10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’The best signs from the Put It To The People march in London‘Million’ protesters gather in London for march against Brexit Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumSurrounding Ms Angelotti as she walked down Whitehall – to where speakers included London mayor Sadiq Khan, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and The Independent’s editor Christian Broughton – was a sea of noise and a mile of colour. Or, rather, a mile of blue and yellow.The shades of the EU were everywhere, from teenagers resplendent in streaks of yellow eyeliner to mums (and dads) donning long blue wigs. Think cup final day on Wembley Way, and you have the right sort of vibe. Only here, supporters were asking – given the closeness of the first result, given the misinformation they say was spread, and given the ever-unfolding sense of calamity – for a chance to rethink and replay.“That’s not an unreasonable request,” said Sorcha Kirker, an archaeology student at University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) in Scotland. “Theresa May has given parliament two votes on this – and she wants another – so why are the people being denied a second say? That isn’t democracy.”Ms Kirker herself\u0026nbspwas speaking after a 28-hour journey to be in London. The 27-year-old lives on Orkney. To get to the capital, she had to leave home at 4.30am on Friday, take a boat to the mainland town of Thurso, travel by train to Inverness, and then, at 9pm, catch the 12-hour overnight bus to London.If you’re reading this anytime between 8.30pm on Saturday and 10pm\u0026nbspon Sunday, she’s still on her way back home again.“Am I tired?” she asked. “Well, I got about two hours sleep on the bus so that’s something. You come to something like this and adrenalin takes over anyway. There are 24 of us here from the UHI, and we’ve all come because this is too important to miss because of something like geography. It’s our future. Brexit is a disaster. It takes away so many opportunities from young people that our parents had – that can’t be fair.”She and her group were carrying massive EU flags – but placards were largely the order of the day.Indeed, if national referendums could be initiated by the sheer originality of signs being waved alone, it’s probably fair to say, the Electoral Commission would, right now, already be organising a Final Say vote.They varied from pop cultural references (“Frankie Says Remain”) to the poetic (“Let’s stay among the stars”), to the somewhat crude: “If only Nigel’s dad had been so keen to pull out,” read one.Bright yellow stickers featuring the slogan “Bollocks to Brexit”, meanwhile, were everywhere. Including, by the end of the day, entirely covering the Cabinet Office front door in Whitehall. After one person\u0026nbspstuck their sticker there, hundreds more protestors followed suit – turning this historic door yellow.“If Theresa May really thinks she knows how we feel, she might want to look at her own Cabinet Office entrance next time she passes,” said Rob Hollinger, as he added another circular sticker to the mass. “She says she speaks for the British public. She doesn’t speak for anyone here.”It was a sentiment shared by 14-year-old Jacob Henry. “I got off my Xbox to be here,” his placard told the world.The youngster, from Milton Keynes,\u0026nbspwas there with his parents and 16-year-old sister Alice.“I don’t know if any of this will make a difference,” his dad Leroi, a 49-year-old academic, said. “But maybe the momentum is starting to move in favour of a second vote. I feel the country is starting to shift but I don’t know if it will be too late. But I just think, as a family, we felt we had to try to do something. We had to be able to say in future we gave this a shot.”Pursued by a toilet, Farage’s foot soldiers slog 270 miles for BrexitIt was a hopefulness and positivity that infused the spirit of the whole procession.With a petition asking for Article 50 to be revoked topping 4\u0026nbspmillion signatures even as the march started, many people felt, now more than ever, the tide of opportunity was turning towards them.Certainly Alice Joinel hoped so. She was the mother of possibly the youngest march participant of all. Carried in a papoose\u0026nbspwas nine-week-old Anouk.“How’s she found it?” said Alice, who works in publishing in London. “She’s actually slept through most of it. Woke up for the odd feed, then gone back to sleep again. She seems pretty unfazed.”The 32-year-old came because she felt it was important for the little one’s future.\u0026nbsp“Leaving the European Union is going to make her future so much harder and with so fewer opportunities,” she said. “And as a parent, that’s unbearable. So we had to come. Her dad – my partner –\u0026nbspis actually French, so you might say she wouldn’t even be here without the EU – that’s how important it is to us.”As the day came to a close – anti-Brexit chants still filling the twilight – a band could be heard finishing off in Trafalgar Square: Brass Against Brexit.How did march go for the group?“Brilliant,” said James again. “A few of us in this band play\u0026nbspGlastonbury every year and we’ve played the Rio carnival and, of course, it’s impossible to compare. But this was special: just people getting into it, waving their flags, giving us thumbs up. It felt like we were a part of\u0026nbsphistory.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Managers who break their companies blame the workers. Now we can add prime ministers who lose elections blame their MPs. I may be naive.

In a shrinking world of global terrorism, international tax avoidance, millisecond communication, giant corporations,\u0026nbspsuperpowers, mass migration, climate change and a host of other global threats our duty is to build on our achievements, to maintain our access to the corridors of world power, to keep our place on the stages of the world.“We can debate the motives and obligations of those in public life. What cannot be in doubt is our responsibility to our young generations to pass on to them a country richer, more powerful, safer than that we ourselves inherited. Our partnership with Europe is that destiny.“Walk tall. Keep the faith. Go back to your villages, your towns and your cities. Tell them you were here. Here, In parliament square. Outside the buildings that inspire parliamentary democracy. Fighting for our tomorrow. In peace. Secure.

By the early hours of Sunday morning\u0026nbspmore than 4,750,000 people had signed.The official website has crashed numerous time since the petition leapt in popularity on Wednesday following Theresa May’s appeal to the British people to support her as she demanded MPs back her deal.Signatures continued to be added even after the threat of a no-deal exit on 29 March was removed when EU leaders agreed Brexit could be delayed.Asked about the growing number of signatories on Thursday, Ms May said she did not believe in halting the deadline after the EU offered a delay plan.Created with Sketch.

This includes British citizens living overseas.”Analysis by software firm Tableau of the 16,000 petitions running on the government website showed the revoke Article 50 petition had more than three times as many signatures as all the pro-Brexit petitions combined.After the number of signatures passed one million, the petitions committee, a cross-party group of MPs appointed to examine petitions to parliament, said the rate of signing was the highest its website had ever had to deal with.Organiser Margaret Anne Georgiadou wrote: “The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’.“We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now for remaining in the EU. A People’s Vote may not happen – so vote now.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

To allow the house to seek a majority on the way forward”. This was confirmed by Mr Clark, the business secretary, on Friday,There are several ways that this could happen.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe government could hold its own indicative votes, as promised, if\u0026nbspMs May’s deal is defeated.Seven possible\u0026nbspoutcomes are likely\u0026nbspto be voted on: the prime minister’s deal, a fresh referendum, revoking Article 50, a no-deal exit, a deal involving a permanent\u0026nbspcustoms union with the EU, a deal involving a customs union and\u0026nbspaccess to the single market, and a less comprehensive agreement in the form of a free trade deal.However, a group of senior backbench MPs, including former Tory ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve\u0026nbspand Labour’s Hilary Benn, has said the\u0026nbspgovernment should not be allowed\u0026nbspto set the terms of the votes.\u0026nbspThey have tabled a Commons amendment that would pave the way for indicative votes to be held next Wednesday, regardless of whether or not the government agrees.MPs to be offered free votes on ‘plan B’ Brexit, says Kwasi KwartengOne of those involved, former Conservative minister Nick Boles, said it was crucial that MPs, not ministers, are allowed to define the options to be voted on.He said: “MPs supporting the different options must be in charge of defining them and control the drafting of the motions. Otherwise they will be setting us up to fail.“We have all been working very hard to craft alternative compromises and the government, frankly, hasn’t a clue where the potential for consensus lies because it hasn’t engaged properly.”Then there is the question of the process by which\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwould actually vote.One system would see the Commons ide on a series of yesno votes on specific proposals in the usual way.\u0026nbspNorway-style Brexit may not be right for UK, says Icelandic PMWho is left to stop Theresa May from leading us to a no-deal Brexit?Seven Labour frontbenchers set to join Put it to the People march This is likely to appeal to Downing Street because, if all the alternatives were voted down, Ms May could insist her deal was the only viable outcome. The danger, though, is that no option receives a majority.\u0026nbspIn a bid to avoid this “last man standing” scenario, an alternative devised by Sir Oliver would involve indicative votes\u0026nbspusing a paper ballot, adapting the “deferred isions” method\u0026nbspused to hold some Commons votes.\u0026nbspThis would allow MPs to rank Brexit outcomes in order of preferences, rather than simply voting yes or no to each one.\u0026nbspAnother proposal\u0026nbspwould see various rounds of voting held, with the least popular option being discarded at each stage.If\u0026nbspindicative votes are to uncover the basis for a possible consensus in parliament, MPs would need to be free to vote with their conscience\u0026nbsprather than whipped by their parties.Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng appeared to confirm this on Friday, telling the Commons: “If the house is being asked to decide a way forward, it would be surprising if those votes were not free votes.”If Ms May’s deal is rejected once again, it is likely\u0026nbspthat parliament will\u0026nbspbe given its first formal opportunity to vote on what type of Brexit it wants –\u0026nbspjust days before Britain was supposed to be leaving the EU.With ongoing doubts over whether any option would command a Commons majority, though, it is far from clear whether indicative votes\u0026nbspwill provide the route out of the crisis that supporters hope they will.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

here we have pulled together ten of the most outrageous houses from all over the world.Dubbed the Heliodome, this house in France has been described as the “ultimate solar architecture”.Its eye-catching design - constructed by a cabinet maker - is not just for a unique look but to capture the maximum amount of solar rays as possible.It provides free heating in the winter and cools down the house in the summer.But although it is an eco-friendly way of producing heat, many locals have complained about it’s look saying it doesn’t fit in with the French countryside.The giant seashell house is a joy to look at - with dozens of coloured mosaics that light up the indoors living space.The multicoloured house is in Mexico City and was built in .It is full of plants and natural light after being carefully designed but has all the features to make it a modern home.Despite its unusual shape it was designed to fit in with the natural surrounding and make the occupants feel like they were immersed in the wilderness.This WC-shaped house is made from steel, white concrete and glass, with a suggestive opening in the roof.It is in Seoul, South Korea, and continues the bathroom theme as it is full of toilets.The toilet house was built by Sim Jae-duck, chairman of the organising committee of the Inaugural General Assembly of the World Toilet Association.It is called “Haewoojae” which means “a place of sanctuary where one can solve one’s worries” in Korean.The upside down house is in Affoldern, Germany, and took only six weeks to build.It cost about €, and has an interior which is very disorientating to visitors.It was build in the village near the Edersee Lake in , and comes complete with bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom.Every item, including crockery, a bath, knives and a toilet, is glued to the ceiling.Star Trek fans can live in a replica of the Voyager, complete with out of this world lighting and decor.The studio flat in Hinckley, Leicestershire, has been lovingly decked out with the main commands control.No detail has been overlooked in the m flat in the Midlands.It went on sale in  for £,.The Keret House in Warsaw, Poland, was the world’s narrowest house when it was built in .The tiny structure is squeezed in between two other buildings and has been described as more of an art installation.Apparently not as claustrophobic as it looks at cms at its widest point, a long ladder takes the occupant up through ious rooms, which look more like shelves.It was planned to be a temporary home for travelling writers.This snappy home is the work of an artist who died two months before it was completed.The crocodile house in the middle of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is completely hollow.It was completed in  and is now lived in by Thierry Atta, who helped to build it.With windows and a bedroom the unique home is completely liveable and is a popular meeting place for many people in the neighbourhood.This lonely house was built in the middle of a river in .It is perched on a small rock near the Serbian town of Bajina Basta.It was built by a group of young men who thought the rock would be the best place for a tiny shelter, after they needed to rest while out swimming.The man who lives there today was part of the group and has seen off floods and high winds in his little home.One of the strangest homes in the world is one shaped like a giant glittering grand piano and a violin.It is in Huainan, China, and was built in .It features a glass violin propped up against the huge piano, which is the entrance to the house.The piano has a roof terrace beneath a canopy shaped like it’s open top."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/dk-comp-graphic-page10brexit.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mps vote theresa mays deal brexit slipping hardliners chasing fantasy","story":"Brexit is slipping away.It risks being killed off entirely by the very MPs who claim to love it the most — Conservative backbench Eurosceptics still chasing ­fantasy Brexits.Since last week, the options have changed.First, Parliament voted to rule out No Deal. Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite. Biologists would argue exactly the same.When is this madness going to stop And don’t the Old Bill have better things to do with their time Why should this be  Are they simply delighted they’re not Swedish Other stats might give us a clue.Finland also has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the world. And also one of the higher suicide rates.So they rate highly for happiness because a they’re all perpetually p***ed b the sad ones have all topped themselves.GORGEOUS, pouting Olivia Attwood has been complaining that reality TV stars are prone to mental illness because of the horrible abuse they get online.Perhaps she’s right. There are some nasty t***ers out there, for sure.But might it not also be the case that reality TV stars are prone to mental illness anyway, without the trolls Being famous just for the sake of being famous appeals to a certain kind of rather fragile, insecure personality, I would reckon.THE Oxford English Dictionary has been updated to include the usual raft of gender words. Such as “zir” and “hir” and the horrible “peoplekind”.I hope they have room next year for these following words I’ve just made up: Togerov – a Bulgarian man who has transitioned to female.Abbottophobia – the irrational fear that Diane is about to appear on the TV talking complete b******s.Droll – an internet troll who is nonetheless quite funny.WYLFWTS– someone on a gender studies or media studies course. From the acronym Would You Like Fries With That, Sir IT is time to sort out the gamekeepers – once and for all.A new study has suggested that they are responsible for the illegal killing of one of Britain’s rarest birds, the hen harrier.These scumbags are believed to have killed almost THREE QUARTERS of tagged hen harriers. The killings take place on grouse moors.These moors occupy a vast area of the country.But they are managed for the benefit of a tiny number of iniduals. And the local wildle is destroyed.AMONG the names Scottish people gave to their newborn babies in  were Lucer, Awesome and Adora-belle.I hope Lucer doesn’t feel victimised in what is primarily a Christian country. And I hope Awesome doesn’t end up sleeping rough in Sauchiehall Street with wee seeping out of his trousers.That would be an ironically cruel fate.But it’s good to see that the most popular name in Scotland for boys was Jack.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I hope the people responsible are brought to justice.The building was evacuated during the security alert.A spokesman for the Defence Forces said: A viable improvised explosive device contained in a plastic envelope was identied and made safe. The device was then handed over to An Garda Siochana for further investigation.A group calling itself the IRA has claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to major transport hubs in London and the University of Glasgow.The organisation, known to police as the New IRA, claimed one parcel addressed to a British Army recruitment officer may not have been discovered yet.The group said it posted five devices to addresses in Britain, however only four had been discovered at the time the claim of responsibility was sent to a Belfast newsroom.It is formed of dissident Republicans who reject Northern Ireland’s peace process, which saw paramilitary groups decommission weapons in order to end The Troubles.The IRA was disbanded after the decommissioning and has been inactive for several years but several groups have sprung up under the name.In , the New IRA sent failed devices to Army career offices in England and carried out a car bombing in Londonderry.The New IRA was also behind an attack in  when a prison officer died after a bomb exploded under his van in Belfast.MI’s threat warning of a ­Republican terror attack remains at moderate but police in Northern Ireland and Ireland fear ato a hard border after Brexit, complete with customs and other checks, could be a target for militant groups.Mr Flanagan said the item found in Limerick could be the fth.We have reason to believe this could be the case, he said.The packages that arrived at Waterloo railway station and offices at Heathrow and London City airports on March  and  were posted with Irish stamps and had Dublin as theaddress, prompting Irish police to join the investigation.The stamps appeared to be those issued by the Irish postal service for Valentines Day , featuring a heart mot and the words Love Eire N.The senders addresses were given as Dublin, with two having added coach operator Bus Eireann.Police Scotland said a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution on a suspicious package found in the mailroom at Glasgow University, after several buildings had been evacuated.All packages were A-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jfy bags and appeared capable of igniting a small fire when opened.No-one was injured in any of the incidents in Britain.A Garda spokesman said: This parcel appears to be identical to parcels - pending closer forensic and ballistic examination - discovered earlier this month in London and Glasgow.An Garda Siochana continue to liaise with the UK authorities in relation to these investigations.Irish premier Leo Varadkar condemned the actions of those involved.Speaking in Brussels, he said: First of all I condemn the actions of whoever did this without reservation, no matter what is happening in politics at the moment, its no justication for violence and certainly no justication for potentially exposing civilians to injury or potentially death.The Minister for Justice was in touch with me this morning to inform me of what they know so far, and they did know there were five letter bombs sent a few weeks ago and the fth one has turned up at a postal centre in Limerick so we believe its one of the same batch and this is the fth one now."},{"url":null,"title":"donors urge matt hancock tory leadership theresa may","story":"Conservative party donors believe he offers the party competence, with one MP describing the relatively young Cabinet minister as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”, the Foreign Secretary.Mr Hancock - who has been heavily involved in No Deal Brexit planning - replaced Mr Hunt as Health Secretary last year when Boris Johnson quit as Foreign Secretary.But Mr Hunt is the frontrunner among Cabinet ministers, according to Forsyth’s column in today’s Sun.He has the support of more Cabinet ministers than anybody  and is seen as a “safe pair of hands and having the emotional intelligence to hold the party together”.And it comes days after reports suggested Mr Hancock would team up with Mr Hunt in a plot to stop Boris Johnson from becoming leader.The pair reportedly believe they can shut Boris out of the crucial final two spots - clearing the way for Mr Hunt to become PM.Mrs May is under increasing pressure to quit over the summer - whether or not her Brexit deal makes it through the Commons.When she does go, more than a dozen Tories could throw their hat in the ring to succeed her as party leader and Prime Minister.Other Cabinet ministers likely to run in the next Tory leadership contest include Michael Gove.Well-connected Treasury minister Mel Stride is at the forefront of urging the top Brexiteer to run, Forsyth writes.Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss is also expected to run for leader but many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her own agenda than becoming PM.The three frontrunners are seen as being Mr Johnson, Mr Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid.In the leadership contest, MPs will whittle the starting field down to two, with party members then choosing between them.If Boris makes it to the last two, his supporters in Parliament are confident he will be activists’ preferred choice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this country won’t know where things are going to end up until April .On Wednesday, No Deal ­suddenly seemed a likely option again. The EU were saying they would only grant Theresa May’s request for an extensionher Brexit deal passed before March , something that is highly unlikely.I am told that at the No Deal ministers’ meeting on Wednesday night, “the mood was totally dferent to previous meetings, as people thought it might actually happen”.It was agreed that a small group of ministers — Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health ­Secretary Matt Hancock, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley — would meet again on Friday morning to take the preparations to the next stage.But on Friday morning that meeting was cancelled.Why  Because after the EU agreed to halt the UK’s ­departure until at least April , No Deal is once again highly unlikely.This delay meansMay’s deal fails again, ­Parliament will have enough time to step in and take ­control of the process.The three options now are: May’s deal passes, a softer Brexit is agreed in the next few weeks, or there is a much longer extension to allow a General Election to be held, which could mean no Brexit at all. At the moment, the Brexit deal isn’t going to pass.Getting it through was always going to be hard, but the errors Mrs May made this week have made it even more ­dficult.As one Secretary of State puts it: “She would have been much better off spending three days in bed.”Her speech on Wednesday night, criticising MPs, was also ill-judged, given that they are who she needs to win over.It was particularly mistaken given May had turned down an invitation to address her own MPs that evening.One normally mild-mannered backbencher tells me: “It was offensive to us. You decline to come and talk to us — then insult us.”The Government’s domino strategy for winning the vote required getting the DUP to come on board.There is only one way to change this dynamic — for May to offer to goher deal passes.This would instantly change the debate. In the past few days, one Tory MP who wants No Deal and another who wants a second referendum told me they would vote for a ­withdrawal agreementthey had a guarantee she would go.“An increasing number of people are saying their vote is contingent on her going,” says a senior backbencher.As one Cabinet minister admits: “Even that may not be enough.” But without it, there’s no chance of the deal passing next week.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.AMID all this uncertainty, one thing is looking increasingly clear: Britain will have a new Prime Minister soon.Opinion has turned against Theresa May ­following her ill-judged speech on Wednesday.“She has managed to offend everybody,” one previously loyal minister tells me.And one Secretary of State fumes: “She’s alienated Parliament, the Cabinet and the EU.”There are no shortage of leadership candidates sounding people out.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has the support of more ­Cabinet ministers than anybody . He is seen as a safe pair of hands and as having the ­emotional intelligence to hold the party together.Sajid Javid was the frontrunner. But as always happens in Tory leadership contests, that has put a target on his back. He has had a dficult few weeks and is losing support.Cabinet ministers are convinced that Andrea Leadsom is running. They point out how, at Cabinet this week, she spoke in a string of highly quotable lines about Leave voters being let down.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is also expected to go for it. But many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her pro-growth agenda than anything .Michael Gove is being urged to stand, with Mel Stride, the well-connected Treasury minister, at the forefront of efforts to persuade Gove to run.Matt Hancock is another being encouraged to enter the race. He is the new toast of the party donor classes, who think he offers competence. One MP describes him as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”.On the backbenches, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson are competing to be the Brexiteer ­candidate. Raab’s campaign is better organised – he has ten MPs gathering support for him.But Johnson has the proven electoral record and greater experience. One thing to remember, though. Tory leadership races are like the Grand National: Messy, unpredictable and the favourite rarely wins. THE absurdity of Labour’s Brexit position is that it accepts the withdrawal agreement.What it takes issue with is the political ­declaration, which isn’t legally binding.Voting through the Brexit deal would not stop Labour from getting to any of the softer Brexit ­outcomes that it has been proposing in recent months.You could negotiate almost any kind of Brexit from the withdrawal agreement.But Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to vote for it because he doesn’t want to vote for a “Tory Brexit”.It would bring the withdrawal agreement, ­without the political declaration, to the Commons and dare Labour to vote it down.If Labour blinked and the withdrawal agreement passed, we would then be out of the EU and into the transition ­period.The EU would also be satisfied and consider us to have ratied the agreement.If Labour voted down the withdrawal agreement, then it would be clear what their motives were.IF there is no chance of the Brexit deal ­passing unless Theresa May promises to go, who can tell her that This is what ministers have been discussing with each other in the past  hours. They think her No aides won’t, so somebody  needs to.The obvious candidate is Sir ­Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee of Tory MPs. Brady is discreet and respected. But it is now time for him to put on his grey suit and carry this message to May.May promising to go so long as the withdrawal ­agreement is passed would show that it really isn’t all about her.And history would view her in a much more sympathetic light.ONE reason why the UK might end up leaving the EU by April  is the Labour leadership don’t want the European elections to take place any more than ­Theresa May does.They know parties in favour of a second referendum would attack Labour for its equivocation on this point.Jeremy Corbyn, who walked out of a meeting this week because Chuka Umunna had been invited, wouldn’t want to give the breakaway ­Independent Group such a perfect launch pad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If she backed a two-year delay, the other half would walk out.The multi-choice vote on the best way forward is expected on Wednesday will almost certainly demand an extension beyond June  – which the PM has already insisted was unacceptable.A senior MP said: “She has less than three weeks to tell the EU what her next step is. If it’s an extension she is finished. Nobody is going to let her stay on the get us out of this mess.”The only formal process to remove her is a no-confidence vote of the  committee of MPs. But their failed bid to topple her in December means they cannot try again for a year.That means she has to be persuaded to resign – or brought down by a general election.Some angry MPs are suggesting the “nuclear option” a “Vote strike” until she gets the message.Mrs May’s allies yesterday warned that politics will be in meltdown unless they come to their senses and back the deal.THERESA May has been accused of being the Sven-Goran Eriksson of politics - having no Plan B.The PM has failed to set out another route out of the Brexit chaos remaining tight-lipped when quizzed this week by EU leaders.The Swede, who managed England between  and , was accused for not having a rescue strategy by pundits.Mrs May has written to all MPs to indicate she may not bring back her dealit can’t command enough support to secure victory.One Minister said: “Like Sven, she has no plan B when things go wrong. She just keeps moving the goal posts. She has now lost control of her dressing room.“She has been running down the clock but now the EU have blown the whistle.”Mrs May refused to sack Remain-backing Cabinet Ministers including Amber Rudd when she defied the party to keep no deal off the table infuriating colleagues.Another Minister added: “Everyday you hope the PM and Number  can’t make it any worse and then they do.”Hardline Brexiteers insist the PM should enact the law as it stands and leave without a deal when the deadline is reached at pm on Friday.But by agreeing to extend Article  last week EU chiefs have trumped UK law so it is now impossible to crash out.A Brexit-backing minister said: “Lots of Eurosceptics are thinking ‘one more push and we’ll get it over the line by Friday’ but the truth is they won’t.“A communique released by the European Commission last week has changed the rules.“So evenwe have carried out all the legislation required to leave the EU, that will be trumped by international law which dictates that the extension to Article  takes precedence.”Another pro-Brexit minister added: “Can’t they see that their Brexit dream is sinking before their eyes “They are behaving like passengers on the Titanic, who can see the ship going down but refuse to join a leboat and stand there pointing at the guarantee on the main deck.”Cabinet discipline has broken down with Business Secretary Greg Clark being accused “freelancing” when he announced the PM would back a series of indicative votes.One minister said: “Number  are furious as his attempt to bounce her into it. If she ends up having to go through with it, there will be some pretty angry people on the back benches, too.”If MPs seize control of the process this week, Mrs May could give Tories a free vote.Former minister Mark Francois, vice chairman of the European Research Group, said is proved she had given up the ghost on leading the country.He declared: “If the government of this country does not have a view on how to proceed and the most important question facing Britain since the end of the second world war then, in effect, we no longer have a government, just a collection of iniduals who call themselves ministers of the crown.Despite her best intentions and a dogged determination to see Brexit through, the chances of her deal ever getting Commons support are pitiably low.Some senior ministers put the likelihood of it passing next week at  per cent.The PM has seen her own authority seep away and is now unable to uny her own Cabinet, let alone the party in general.That means she is powerless even to call an election.As the  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady points out here, her deal may be threadbare but it still offers the only realistic chance of Brexit actually taking place.Backing it would give Britain a chance of a new start. If the deal fails again it seems Philip Hammond and David Lidington will be knocking on the PM’s door to tell her the time has come to make an exit.But in the midst of this paralysing crisis even that is not an easy option.There is no clear route to appointing a successor in the short term. And with the party at loggerheads even a swt transition to a caretaker PM is perilous.After this week’s turmoil we face being stuck for some time with a lame-duck Prime Minister, whoever it may be.Britain needs a miracle to avoid it.“It’s a total and utter shambles and it’s all the Prime Minister’s fault.”A Number  insider said: “Everyone at Number  is losing their rag at the slightest issue. It really does feel like the last days of Rome. Bunker mentality has set in.”“Even in the early part of this week, the PM felt she could deliver her domestic agenda after getting Brexit through.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK itself has been more successful in recent years in growing its trade with markets outside the EU than with those that are inside the single market and customs union.It baffles me that so many British politicians have so little faith in Britain that they think we would be sunkwe had to stand on our own two feet.The mistakes that have brought us to this point are well known: agreeing to decide the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement before settling the future trading relationship with the EU agreeing to a “backstop” to prevent a “hard border” in Ireland allowing the militant Remainers in Parliament to damage Britain’s negotiating position by taking “No Deal” off the table and allowing our exit date to be deferred.If only we had accepted the EU’s offer two years ago to have a big Canada-Plus free trade agreement, we could have locked in certainty for business and spent the last two years trying to improve upon it!The question now is what’s the best way to achieve the proper Brexit that the British people voted for nearly three years ago I understand why so many of my Tory and DUP friends have voted against the PM’s deal. I told her in November the “backstop” made it impossible for anyone who wanted to leave the EU to vote for it: it could lock the UK into the EU customs union for ever.That is why I voted against it the first time. It’s also why I tabled the “Brady amendment” — which was voted through at the end of January, telling the PM to go back and ensure the “backstop” couldn’t become a permanent trap.When the Government’s lawyer Geoffrey Cox said the changes agreed would allow a way out in most circumstanceswe were faced with a tough choice.To take a risk and support the deal or keep voting against, hoping something better would emerge. It was defeated a second time, with a big majority against.Those of us who really want Brexit to happen and British politics to be able to get on with other things are now faced with taking a massive political judgment.By voting for the pretty threadbare deal Theresa May brought back from Brussels, we can ensure some sort of Brexit and then a new negotiating team that believes in what it’s doing can work to get something worthwhile out of the future relationship after we have left.If we don’t vote the deal through this week, it no longer looks like Theresa’s promise that “no deal is better than a bad deal” will be honoured. Two years ago,  per cent of you voted for a political party — whether Tory or Labour — that promised to implement the referendum decision.Two years on Labour is angling for a second referendumand lots of other MPs are pushing for a Brexit that amounts to staying in. Some want endless delay, a few are at least honest enough to admit they really want to ignore the decision of . million voters altogether.Meanwhile, the EU is creaking. Just as the EU is set for crisis, this country is poised for success.British businesses are sitting on big cash balances but are crying out for the certainty that will allow them to invest.If we deliver on our promise to leave in the coming weeks, Britain will prosper. If we get stuck in the departure lounge, our country will suffer.For heaven’s sake, let’s settle this now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Put It To The People campaign said the march has overtaken Octoberaposs protest, which attracted around ,. High-density crowds packed the streets as protesters set off from Park Lane ahead of a rally outside Parliament. Crowds have called on the government to give the public the final say on how - and even- Britain leaves the European Union. This morning a petition calling for Article  to be revoked - meaning Britain would remain in the EU - became the most popular ever hosted on the Parliament website. By this afternoon, more than . million people had signed it. Politicians from across the political spectrum - including Nicola Sturgeon, Tom Watson, and David Lammy - have addressed crowds in Parliament Square as pressure mounts on Theresa May . Speakers told of the aposliesapos during the Leave campaign and the lack of control and aposchaosapos of the Brexit process, while urging the PM to let people have their say. Meanwhile, a separate march by Brexiteers numbering around  was addressed by Nigel Farage this morning.  Marching bands, music, whistles, chants and cheers provided a noisy backdrop to the aposput it to the peopleapos march. Demonstrators wore blue and yellow berets and flew large EU flags above the crowd as the march slowly made its way to Parliament Square. A spokesman from the Peopleaposs Vote campaign earlier said: “It is almost impossible to put an exact figure on the size of this immense crowd because it is spilling out across central London. The start of the march at Park Lane has been filled to bursting point and many thousands of people are trying to make their way to Parliament Square through side streets. At the time the rally began, people were still arriving in Park Lane. Our estimate is based on professional expert advice and whatever the exact number, there can be no doubt that this ranks as one of the greatest protests  - possibly the biggest ever – that this country has ever seen. We have no doubt that this march is bigger than the last with our early estimate putting the size of the crowd at around  million.  James McGrory, the director of the People’s Vote campaign and one of the organisers of the march, said the campaign for a second Brexit referendum is now the biggest mass movement in Britain, dwarfing the membership of the main political parties. “People from all walks of le see can what they were once offered bears no relation to what is being delivered and they are angry about it because it feels like a bad deal is being rammed down their throats,” he told Reuters.    The Mayor of London kicked off the speeches criticising ‘party politics’ as delaying a Brexit deal. He said: “I have lived in London all my le. I have never seen London look so magnicent as you do today. “Just days ago we were in danger of falling off the clf which would have catastrophic consequences. “We have seen party politics repeatedly put ahead of national interest. “We have seen the government ignore our warnings time and time again. “It’s time to say loud and clear enough is enough.”  Addressing the crowd in Parliament Square, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson said: “We are one million strong.” He said he was there on behalf of his -year-old daughter. “She has told me to thank you for campaigning for her future,” he said. Mr Watson said the Prime Minister’s deal “pleases no-one”. “If you voted remain it’s a rubbish deal,you voted leave it’s a lousy deal. There are no winners, only losers,” he said. He added: “Brexit is stuck in the parliamentary pipeworks and it’s not going to find a way out.” Addressing his comments to Theresa May, he said: “I can only vote for a dealyou let the people vote on it too. “Prime Minister, you’ve lost control of this process, you’re plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control.”   First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also took to the stage. She said: “I bring with me today solidarity from Scotland. “A land where  per cent voted to remain in the European Union. “Our voice has been ignored. “But it is not merely our voice that has been ignored - but the voice of the  percent who voted remain across the UK has been ignored. “And the voice of those wanting to leave but who could never have contemplated the maze that Brexit has become. Their voice is being ignored as well. “My message is for every European national living in the UK, in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland. “We think you are welcome here and we want you to stay. “What has been done to you by these Brexiteers politicians has been nothing short of desperation.” Concluding her speech to raucous applause and cheering she said: “Put this back to the people and let us sort Brexit.”  David Lammy MP for Tottenham also spoke to the protesters. He said: “They told us that we have £ million on the NHS. They lied. “They told us we could leave the EU with all of the benefits and none of the consequences. They lied. “They told us we would have  trade deals the minute they left. They lied. “And now we come together and say enough is enough.” Comedian and Great British Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig said: “It is women and minorities who will pay the price for Brexit just as we pay the price for austerity. “There’s no denying we did not have the facts. There were lies all over the country. “There are those who would like to drive that bus with all of us on it into the clfs. “Stop the bus. Listen to the people when they rise up and march.”  Among those taking part in the march are people who voted to leave in , but have since changed their mind. Leon French, , who works in the educational sector, said: “I am delighted to attend the Put it to the People March on Saturday so that I can make my voice heard loud and clear to Parliament that the public need a final say on this blindfold Brexit. “I voted to Leave in  and it is now completely clear to me we were given a blank cheque full of  promise. The easy solution to all our problems we were told Brexit would be has quickly unravelled to be a mess we will be cleaning up for years to come. Britain deserves better than this circus. Now that we know how Brexit will damage the whole of the UK, the public deserve the right to say loud and clear: this is not good enough.” And Emma Knuckey, , from Essex, said: “I’m coming to the march to demand a People’s Vote because I don’t want millions of people paying for my mistake. Seeing so many people who did not get a say in this be so affected is horric. The younger generation who will live the longest with the result, and the  million people made up of Europeans in the UK and Brits in Europe, deserve a final say.”  People of all ages took part and were passionate about the cause. Amelie Upson-Sandland, , says she is worried she won’t be able to see her family as she lives in France. With a European flag displaying the flags of each of the countries her relatives are from, the schoolgirl said: “If Britain leaves I’m worried my family won’t be able to see me or stay with me in France.” Dad Philip added: “I might have to get some kind of long term visa. But it’s more than that, we want to see all of our relatives. We are all over the place. “It’s Europe we want to be part of. We are European you can’t take it out of us.” Leaders agreed to extend Brexit to May Mrs May can get MPs to back her deal in the Commons at the third time of asking. If the vote is not passed, the UK will have to set out an alternative way forward by April , which could mean a much longer delay - with the UK required to hold elections to the European Parliament - or leaving without a deal at all.

Both Brexiteers and Remainers say they will force the PM to go on April she breaks her promise not to hold EU elections. The EU has given her until then to decide whether the UK goes to the polls on May  to elect  British MEPs. Nigel Evans, of the powerful Tory backbench  committee, said: “Brexit has more dates than a Turkish food market. But opting for EU elections would be game over for the PM.”    Brexiteer Mr Evans will vote for the PM’s dealby some miracle it comes before the Commons this week. But he says she should have insisted the UK Brexits on March  instead of caving into the EU’s extension offer. He added: “It’s like a boxing match. She’s been pummelled for  rounds and then jumps at the chance to go another four. “If she keeps avoiding the crunch the EU won’t give her a solution to the Irish backstop to get the DUP onside.” Tory MP Steve Double added: “We need to find a way forward and that requires new leadership.” Tomorrow Mrs May will have Brexit taken out of her hands when Tory grandee Sir Oliver Letwin tables a Commons amendment allowing MPs to seize control.    It paves the way for a set of votes on Wednesday for alternative Brexits. Options will include a second referendum, permanent customs union, Common Market . for single market membership and Norway Plus – Labour’s proposal for a customs union AND single market alignment. MPs could also decide to revoke Article  so there is no Brexit. The petition demanding just that hit more than four million signatures yesterday. As MPs will be in charge on Wednesday, the PM cannot table her crucial third vote on her Withdrawal Bill that day. If an alternative to Brexit gets a majority, a long delay to negotiate it is inevitable. Which means EU elections will go ahead.    Sir Oliver said: “If we are to produce a solution, MPs must be willing not to insist on their first preference but settle for something they can tolerate. “But a No Deal exit would be so hideous it would be very, very wrong and mind-bogglingly complicated. “That’s why we need an orderly process of withdrawal which has put me in the bizarre position of voting against my own side.” No sources warn No Deal would lead to a General Election. But any attempt by Brexiteers to get one by forcing a vote in Parliament on sticking to the original March  deadline has been kiboshed.    Thanks to decisions taken in Brussels, international law trumps Westminster’s wishes. Sir Oliver’s plan will have Labour support. Jeremy Corbyn said: “It’s time for Parliament to take control of the Brexit process.” But Mr Corbyn’s deputy Tom Watson yesterday broke ranks by pledging to back Mrs May’s deal on the condition she holds a referendum. He said in a speech to People’s Vote marchers: “Let the people take back control.”    Leaving with No Deal would cause three months of chaos, secret Cabinet Office documents reveal. Operation Yellowhammer – to minimise the impact of No Deal – will be put in place tomorrow. A bunker at MoD HQ in Whitehall will coordinate the deployment of , troops in case of civil unrest.

She was desperate to be the first female PM – and was mfed when Maggie beat her to it when she was still at uni. But she got her leopard-print- shod foot in the door of No – where she’s shown herself to be a leader without backbone, negotiation skills, charm or a persuasive voice – or sometimes a voice at all.  Forget running through fields of wheat, Theresa. Leading your country into oblivion could top that in the naughty stakes. Still, she’s right when she said this week that we’re “tired of the infighting, tired of the political games… tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit”. It’s true. I heard more sensible debate in Lord Sugar’s boardroom when I was on The Apprentice. Mostly, though, we’re tired of her. Tired of her inability to lead, show clear direction and convince her MPs, let alone anyone in Europe. Why would anyone believe it is her way or no way on Brexit, when she has built her leadership on a mountain of U-turns  We are living under a cloud of gloom and uncertainty and blaming other MPs, and ranting for the cameras does not prove she is “on our side”. It proves she is desperate. Perhaps she should look to ­ordinary folk like myself for some inspiration on how to get results.  In my world, as a busy working mum of two, I would relate this to my everyday le. And Brexit would become an egg. Say I’m boiling eggs for breakfast and my kids must choose how they want them. Of course they are never going to agree – Zac wants his hard- boiled and Amara wants her soft. I tell them they must pick one – their school bus is nearly here. But they won’t ­compromise. “Right,” I say through gritted teeth. “Last chance – hard or soft ” So they cut off their noses to spite their faces and have no eggs at all. I’m not a tyrant. I give them another option. “Have Nutella on toast!” I say. But still no deal. I refuse to call the head to say we will be late because we are still debating breakfast. I do not want to appear indecisive and open to exploitation. I want trust and respect. Plus, the head would give me a polite, “on your bike, love”. But I know the longer I drag it out, the weaker I look. My kids need boundaries. They need to know who is in charge. Andthey can’t come to a ­conclusion, tough. I don’t want them to walk all over me – I have to show strength. So they go to school hungry. Andyou have good friends they will slip you some crisps to keep you going anyway. OK, some intellectuals might laugh at my analogy. But right now, we are the laughing stock of Europe. So maybe you don’t need ­intellectuals running this country. You need real people with common sense. Truly fighting for our side. Not stumbling out of the EU with all kinds of egg on their faces.

And in the  months since, the accountant has shed the pounds to weigh st lbs - and fit comfortably into a size . People often look at my before pictures and say that I look so dferent, they say that I even stand dferently. That’s because I am now dferent, I am now confident, I’m happy, I’m healthy and I’m full of energy. I feel worlds apart from the old useless Fiona that I felt so disappointed in, she said.    I’ll always remember a comment that was made to me when I was overweight and helping out in a friends pub, aposyou don’t sweat much for a fat chick!apos I’m sure the comment was made in jest, but those words will always be in mind and I never want to be a aposfat chickapos again.

Fiona, from Axminster, Devon, added: I needed to get my spark back, feel comfortable walking down the street and needed to be me again! Iaposd been unhappy with my weight for two years but finally last January I decided to actually change my ways.    I was obese and decided to set myself a goal to lose weight. I was also determined to feel confident in my bikini on the beach. I didnapost even feel comfortable on my wedding day in Las Vegas in  so I knew something needed to change. My weight had spiralled out of control and I was eating family sized blocks of chocolate at least twice per day.    Me and my husband, Leo would often enjoy takeaways for dinner and I worked opposite a McDonaldaposs which didnapost help. Fiona found she was struggling to breathe while walking in early . And she had to give up her beloved football training. But now sheaposs exercising again and confident with her body.

Increased use of NHS cessation services and the popularity of e-cigs and heated tobacco account for the decline in smoking. But Public Health England warned: “Regular e-cigarette use is plateauing. There is an opportunity to further reduce the harms caused by tobacco by encouraging more smokers to try vaping.” Mark MacGregor, of Philip Morris, said: “There are more alternative options than ever to help people give up cigarettes for good.”    The company wants to stop producing cigarettes altogether by selling smoke-free products instead.

Viewers picked up on a line in the show the toddler was sleepy in the hours before she was picked up by her parents from a daycare centre at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in . People are now suggesting the McCann family were spied on and three-year-old Maddie was drugged by the kidnapper in the hours before she was snatched from her bed. Maddieaposs parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, were eating out with friends at a tapas restaurant close to the hotel and regularly checked up on their children before realising their daughter was gone. In the show itaposs said Maddie was sleepy on the day she was kidnapped and the fact her twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, failed to wake up when she vanished is adding fuel to the theory online.    Social media users believe the toddler was drugged after being watched by the kidnapper at the resortaposs Kids Club and that her brother and sister were also spiked. Nicola Begg said on Twitter in response to the show: So what[the kidnapper] had been watching Maddie, watched that the McCanns were leaving their apartment for dinner and checking every half an hour, then on the day she disappeared gave the three kids something to make them so tired they wouldn’t wake  Then went in after Gerry first checked on the kids, took Maddie easily as the kids had been drugged, sold her on etc  Just one theory. Fellow viewers of the eight part series, which retraces the steps of the moments leading to Maddieaposs disappearance and the subsequent investigation, agree it is a plausible explanation.    Maddie OaposLeary said: My opinion having watched episode   is that the McCann children were all sedated by someonethen someone abducted Maddie somehow and sold her through the dark web. Laura Spencer wrote: One theory - Kateaposs friends said Maddie was really tired coming back from the kids club. Possibly [someone] had his eye on her, drugged her earlier in the day to make sure she wouldnapost kick up a fuss when she was snatched later in the evening. The documentary series features more than  experts and people involved in the investigation.    But Kate and Gerry McCann refused to take part in the show. The programme covers ious versions of what may have happened  years ago from bungling cops pinning blame to Maddieaposs parents and claims she is still alive.

Edward was forced to abdicate his throne in order to marry her. Both Meghan and Wallis were -years-old when they met their royal husbands and the two are also American orcees.

I think sheaposs heading for a tricky situation because I actually think very little has changed in the last eight years in terms of the power of courtiers.What Iaposve discovered in my research for my book on Wallis Simpson and Princess Diana is that the one goal of the monarchy, the ultimate goal, is survival and for that the spotlight has to be on the monarch or the heir apparent.   The writer went on to criticise Meghanaposs lavish New York baby shower as very poor taste, saying that the -year-old cannot continue living like an A-list Hollywood star. She added: Meghan seems to want to bring her own style to the monarchy and I donapost think itaposs appropriate and I donapost think itaposs going to work long-term.

Kelly-Anne Combes, , was so humiliated about her severe bladder weakness she desperately kept it a secret from her husband for more than a year. The writer, from Norfolk, found she was repeatedly wetting herself in public and social situations, and compared her plight to having to potty train herself. She took spare clothes out with her and frequently had to change into them. Yet she suffered in silence. Speaking exclusively to , Kelly-Anne said: I didnapost tell my husband. I didnapost feel I needed to. I couldnapost face telling my friends either. I just made constant excuses as to why I couldnapost go out or see them. I was just so mortied.    Initially, I only confided in my mum, she was the one person that I felt comfortable with telling as I knew she wouldnapost judge me.  But to begin with, it happened a lot but I thought this was just a normal experience after childbirth. Kelly-Anne, who is a lestyle blogger, gave birth to miracle baby Amelia in June  after experiencing dficulty conceiving. But she was mortied to first feel a trickle weeks after childbirth, which quickly became a heavy leak. My sister bought a trampoline so I decided to give it a go.    It began as a trickle, rather than the heavy leak, but I knew something wasnapost right. Initially I ignored it, sweeping it under the carpet as I couldnapost admit that I would have this issue. I had heard of middle-aged women experiencing bladder weakness but not someone of my age. I found it all very embarrassing, the graduate added. The mother-of-oneaposs social le was quickly ruined and the ordeal put a strain on her relationship with her -year-old husband, who doesnapost want to be named. Kelly-Anne stopped going out, distanced herself from her hubby and mates, and grew more and more anxious.    It took her months before she found the courage to tell her mum and sister, who by this stage had four children of her own. The lestyle writer added: I completely lost my confidence and went into isolation. I stopped socialising because I could never relax. Living in a state of anxiety and embarrassment, I soon stopped leaving the house. My way of managing was to isolate myself and not to go out. Feeling shame and embarrassment was a risk that I was not willing to take. But after more than a year of shirking the issue and cover-ups to her hubby, Kelly-Anne was forced to tell him of her plight during a family holiday in August .  Recalling a poignant day, Kelly-Anne said: I was playing football with my husband and Amelia on a beach and I jumped up, and it happened. I had to tell him because I really needed to go back the apartment to get changed. I said aposthis has been happening for a while nowapos and it was becoming more regular than just every so often. He didnapost really know what to say. I donapost think he could quite understand but neither did I really. The only way I can describe it is experiencing the worries of potty training yet itaposs for yourself and not your child. Kelly-Anne eventually saw a doctor and was referred to a professional. The muscles around the mumaposs bladder had become weakened during pregnancy and after childbirth, which led to the urinary incontience. But a third of women suffer from incontinence in the first three months after childbirth, recent statistics show.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have spent a reported £million renovating Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage , in the grounds of Windsor Castle, ­turning it from five flats into a house. On average,  flights pass within a mile of the house every half hour. On one day this week, that included a BA jet, which passed over the roof at , feet at pm. At .pm, a Virgin flight flew over at just , feet. The soundproofing measures are thought to include triple-glazed windows.    Windsor resident Karen Shawcroft said: “You do get used to it, but sometimes it’s an awful racket. A few people have been round to quote for that type of soundproofing, but it’s a great upheaval and is a lot of money.” The building work on Frogmore Cottage, which was a gt from the Queen, will be ­covered by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, but it is expected that Harry and Meghan will pay for the soundproofing. The couple are leaving a two-bedroom Kensington Palace cottage to move to the five-bedroom house, with yoga studio and guest annexe, as they prepare to be parents. Meghan, , who is expecting their first child in weeks, has worked closely with builders during the renovations.    Plans reveal the addition of fireplaces and staircases. A £, “green” energy unit will provide heat, hot water and electricity and a satellite dish will be put up outside the property. Frogmore Cottage has not been substantially updated since Heathrow, five miles to the east, ballooned in size to become the world’s busiest two-runway airport, with , passenger flights every day. A source said: “Since the Seventies, just staff on the Windsor estate have lived there. Aircraft noise has always been a growing problem. I doubt they’ll spend much time in the garden with all that aircraft noise.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rachael bletchly new zealand shows","story":"NewsopinionRachael Bletchly: New Zealand shows true leadership in the wake of terrorNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern threw her arms around those affected by the horric Christchurch mosque shooting and brought solace to a grieving nationShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionJacinda Ardern \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn the wake of the Christchurch massacres New Zealand’s Prime Minister has shown us what true leadership is. Compassion, eloquence and action have marked her out as a truly extraordinary politician. Her instinctive response to the tragedy brought the solace that her grieving ­nation needed. And the -year-old mother of a nine-month-old baby showed how raw emotion can be forged into steel. The terrorist who murdered  people at prayer had tried to sow hatred and ision among peace-loving Kiwis. She threw her arms around them and insisted “We are one.”    And, as the Muslim call to prayer was broadcast live on national TV on Friday, she joined them in worship saying: “We cannot know your grief, but we can walk with you at every stage.” The name of Jacinda Ardern, above, wasn’t widely known outside Australasia nine days ago. Now it is spoken with respect and admiration around the world. But I’m saddened that she has vowed never to utter publicly the name of the gunman, Brenton Tarrant. She says the white supremacist was trying to “lt his profile” and she will “absolutely deny him that notoriety”. Ms Ardern did not say whether she ­believes publicity fuels copycat attacks. But her words reminded me of Margaret Thatcher vowing to deny IRA terrorists “the oxygen of publicity” in the s and the farcical voice broadcast ban that followed.    Of course, we must continue to speak the names of the innocent people who died. Like Khaled Mustafa, , and his son Hamza, , three-year old Mucad Ibrahim, Sayyad Milne, , Linda Armstrong, , and Daoud Nabi, . They must not merge into one body of nameless “victims” of the atrocity. ButTarrant becomes “He Who Must Not Be Named” we risk mythologising him – treating him like a demon and not the inadequate little man he is. We have to highlight his pathetic humanity to challenge the idea that he’s any kind of warrior, to counter his sick “manesto” and murderous video and deny him a voice. We need to speak the criminal’s name as we utterly condemn his unspeakable crime. And Jacinda Ardern has the eloquence and steel to do that better than anyone.

These shocking images capture the growing crisis in mental health services. The low-paid workers were given the le-or-death job at NHS and private clinics raking in millions a year in NHS contracts. One of the images was taken at a mental health unit where a teenage girl killed herself earlier this year. Now worried patients and families have passed the evidence to us because of our Time to Change campaign to improve mental health services. The pictures are now being investigated by a health watchdog. One parent said: “No one seems to know what’s going on at night.” Another added: “You dread waking up to a call that something terrible has happened.” Two of the three healthcare assistants were doing agency shts and have since been barred by the providers.    Former care minister Norman Lamb said the images were “deeply shocking”. “Families have a right to expect loved ones will be safe in hospital,” he said. “These...facilities will charge the taxpayer thousands a week to keep a vulnerable person safe. But many depend on agency workers who may not have been well enough trained or supervised.” One of the disturbing pictures was taken at the privately run Potters Bar Clinic in Hertfordshire. Police and a coroner are now investigating the case of Nadia Shah who took her own le there in January. The secure mental health unit treats teens aged  to .Last week, Emma Duggan, , took a photo of the napping worker supposed to be watching over her.Her mum Lisa Powell, , a teaching assistant from Balham, South London, said: “My daughter has tried to kill and harm herself many times.She is in a clinic because she is a danger to herself. When she showed me photos of her carer sleeping at the end of her bed I was appalled.I haven’t slept properly at night since. You dread a phone call.” The clinic is run by Elysium Healthcare, a private firm with NHS mental health contracts worth millions a year.    Yet a job ad for healthcare assistants posted by Elysium this month advertises a salary of just £,.Healthcare assistant salaries in the NHS can be as low as £,, rising to just £, with a typical hourly wage of £., according to recruitment website glassdoor. A second picture of a sleeping worker was taken earlier this month at the NHS-run Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex – by a suicidal -year-old woman. The patient told us: “He dozed off in front of me. It’s frightening when the person whose job it is to prevent you killing yourself falls asleep.I have tried to hang myself and cut myself over the  years I’ve been in and out of mental health units. Luckily for me I wasnapost having a low mood.” She says a manager took her phone away after learning she’d taken the photo, but a matron ed it to her. A third photo shows another worker asleep on watch over a -year-old rape victim with PTSD.A patient at the Priory Hospital Cheadle Royal in Manchester, she was taken to the city’s Royal Infirmary with an allergic reaction.Two Priory care workers were assigned to travel with her as she was a high suicide risk.One – employed by agency Achieve Care Solutions – nodded off.The patient’s mum said: “After four hellish years my daughter is slowly recovering, but she has had many opportunities to kill herself while staff sleep at night. “This time she thought she’d show what goes on.”  Rising numbers of young people are being diagnosed with conditions like depression and bipolar disorder. And soaring rates of teenagers are being hospitalised. Yet despite the increased demand, funding in many parts of the country is being cut in real terms and hospitals don’t have enough resources to provide safe care.The Care Quality Commission said it would be launching an investigation after viewing the photos. Dr Paul Lelliott, CQC’s deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said: “Mental health inpatient services should ensure all regular and agency staff are qualied, competent and skilled to work with people with mental health conditions.” A TUC report on mental health services says they fail to meet rising demand.It claims in the last five years patients in England have risen by a third – , – while the number of mental health nurses, doctors and beds has fallen.Elysium Healthcare said they have a “zero-tolerance” approach to staff who fail to comply with “clear employment policies”. The firm said any worker sleeping on duty would be sacked. Essex ­Partnership University Trust – which runs the Linden Centre –  said the sleeping assistant, hired through Medilink Consulting, was on his first sht with them and would be banned. Nobody at Medilink Consulting was available for comment. The Priory Hospital Cheadle Royal said sleeping on duty was “gross misconduct” and they carried out night checks on staff. Achieve Care Solutions said the worker concerned had been sacked. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Mental health and expanding the workforce are key priorities for this Government, which is why our NHS Long Term Plan includes an extra £.billion per year by   to further transform mental health services.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid amazing teaching assistant","story":"NewsTributes paid to amazing teaching assistant, , killed by bus outside schoolA grandmother who devoted  years of her le to working with children has been remembered after she was hit and killed by a bus outside Humberstone Junior School, LeicesterShareCommentsByTom MackRachel Lang:,  MAR NewsMelanie Inskip, who died after a collision outside Humberstone Junior School. \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTributes have been paid to an amazing teaching assistant who was knocked down by a bus outside the school where she worked for three decades.

Val Thatcher was a -year-old orced teacher way back in  when she first started writing to the man who would become her second husband. George Thatcher was serving le for shooting a worker dead in an armed robbery on a Co-op dairy, a crime for which he was originally condemned to be hanged. And as the unlikely pair corresponded, and then met over the next six years in jails around the country, their relationship gradually blossomed into romance. Astonishingly, it eventually led to a -year marriage that lasted until George died from a stroke in .    Today retired Val tells how she always believed George, a petty thief and safeblower, was framed for the killing for which he served  years. And a TV show re-examining the case could shed new light on it as modern-day legal experts give it their consideration. A team of barristers will st through evidence from the time and look at question marks over a verbal confession – potentially flagging up a miscarriage of justice. Val, now , said: “I have read George was a man addicted to unreasonable violence, which is so untrue. He was such a gentle person. He wouldn’t have hurt a fly. “It was all an image that was painted of him that just wasn’t true. “Even now, I still can’t help but be upset because of the injustice of what happened to him and the years wasted because of it.”    Val first made contact with George when he was doing time in HMP Albany on the Isle of Wight. Frustrated by what he claimed was his wrongful imprisonment, he had placed an advert in the upmarket magazine New Statesman and it caught Val’s eye. She recalled: “The best thing I ever did was to reply to his advert, which read. ‘Ler, aspiring dramatist and painter seeks new outlets through communication and visits’. “My reaction was ‘Gosh, there is somebody worse off than me’. I felt sorry for him so I wrote him a letter. “Women might write to prisoners to get a kick, but there was none of that prurient fascination – because I had no idea when I replied to the ad what George was supposed to have done. “We exchanged a few letters before I went to visit him a couple of months later. I was very nervous because I had never been inside a prison before but George was so kind and gentle, very dferent from what I was expecting. “He was a wonderful artist and I sent him photos of London because he loved to paint street scenes. He loved creative writing too and had written a play The Only Way Out.    “The manuscript was smuggled out of prison in a painting and was performed at the Royal Court Theatre in London in , which I encouraged people to watch. “It was only when I began toabout the case that I understood it. He always protested his innocence in prison and when I really got to know him, I started to believe him. “He really didn’t seem like an armed robber or a killer.” George was born in  into a childhood of abject poverty and by his s was a career criminal with a string of convictions. On November , , a gang of robbers struck at the Royal Arsenal Co-op in Mitcham, Surrey, and stole £. Detectives called to the scene found the manager’s office ransacked and the safe plundered. Outside, a depot vehicle sat abandoned with its window shot out. And a Co-op employee, father-of-two Dennis Hurden, lay leless at the entrance.  Within hours a getaway car had been found and soon three men, Philip Kelly, John Hilton and Charles Connelly, had been arrested. Kelly gave cops the name of George Thatcher, who denied not only that he shot Mr Hurden but that he had even been on the raid. There was no scientic evidence linking him with the crime and no ID parade was held. The key evidence used against George were statements from police, who testied that he had implicated himself.George was found guilty at the Old Bailey on March ,  of an offence known at the time as capital murder, which carried a mandatory death penalty. His co-accused Kelly, Hilton and Connelly were all convicted of murder and jailedfor le.Less than a month after the trial George’s sentence of execution was commuted to le imprisonment. And though he avoided the hangman’s rope he still spent nearly two decades locked up for a crime Val is still convinced he did not commit.    Val, who was living near Bristol at the time, said: “I never believed that writing to George would end up in us getting married but I wanted to offer him my support. “When we first met he was in Albany and then Parkhurst, where Ronnie Biggs and Mad Frankie Fraser were. Then he was transferred to Coldingley in Surrey, Gartree near Northampton and finally to Leyhill in Gloucestershire. “After a couple of years I realised I was falling in love and George told me he felt the same. “When he got to Leyhill he was allowed occasional phone calls and it was quite easy for him to sneak out. We could meet at night and be romantic.”Val even took her daughter Marion along on visits and George would give her bars of chocolate and toys he had made himself. She added: “By then I couldn’t really  imagine my le without George.“He was recommended twice for parole and turned down by the Home Office but I grew determined to win his release and I wrote to more and more people. “I became George’s leline and his window to the outside world.“Fast-forward to  and his release from prison and our wedding were the two happiest days of my le.“We got married at Bath register office and everyone I taught with at the school turned up.” To start a new le, the couple bought a derelict house in Co Kerry in Ireland, spent years renovating it and eventually moved out there full-time. Val added: “We rarely spoke about what happened and we burned all of our letters along with the manuscript from the trial. It felt cathartic.”  Sadly when George was  he was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. Val left their home because it held too many memories but went back to scatter George’s ashes and film for the BBC’s Murder, Mystery and My Family.The show tells George’s story, with QCs Sasha Wass and Jeremy Dein examining all the facts relating to the case. Val added: “Losing George left a big hole in my le. I spent  years fightinghis corner and it has been very, very hard to readjust.” Murder, Mystery and My Family is on BBC One, weekdays at .am."},{"url":null,"title":"woman knocks beefcake bouncer out","story":"NewsWoman knocks beefcake bouncer out cold with kick to the head in shocking video-year-old Taylor Renee Nealey was caught on film booting the bouncer in the head at a Mardi Gras themed block party in South CarolinaShareCommentsByRachel Lang:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video woman-knocks-out-burly-bouncer-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn a now viral clip, a woman can be seen knocking out a beefcake bouncer with a kick to the head as shocked revellers watch on.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"gran who hurled bleach over","story":"Picture by contracted freelance Steve McKendrick\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gran who hurled bleach over a child has been granted a personal licence to sell alcohol by East Ayrshire council.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity.

And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

This is where a society such as our own, which aspires to provide care and support to all of its citizens, regardless of their special needs is supposed to rise to the challenge.My -year-old niece, Ciara, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, was born with a cocktail of health challenges associated with this condition, including a hole in her heart. Predictably, and at ious stages of her mumrsquos pregnancy the only advice coming from some medical staff was an abortion. The expert care and attention of other nurses and doctors though saw Ciara through the first few dficult years of her le while the love and dedication of her parents and her older brothers and sisters saw her realise her full, human potential. She has blossomed into a beautul and gted young woman who loves Little Mix and Ed Sheeran and who has represented her school and her country at international swimming events.This is the point where I could quote you statistics about the increasing quality of le enjoyed by Downrsquos Syndrome people or about how, on average, they now have a higher le expectancy than before. This, though, would be to diminish the experiences of those whose Downrsquos has come with an assortment of other issues and where the outcomes havenrsquot been as happy. I can only talk about my familyrsquos experiences with Ciara which, from the beginning, have been almost unormly positive ones.The biggest threat to this, though, came quite recently and from an entirely unexpected direction: the Catholic secondary school in England where, during her first three years there, she had enjoyed a very supportive and rewarding educational experience. She made progress in Maths, Science and English but, most importantly, she was happy in a small circle of friends and was included socially.A change of headteacher saw this change drastically when he refused to consider her for entry into the upper school on the grounds that she couldnrsquot meet the entry criteria for sixth form in Maths and English. Appeals to the board of governors were met with the response that ldquofunding was the main issue. When it was discovered that ldquofunding would be provided by the local authority more obstacles were found to prevent her re-joining her friends at her local school of choice. Further, it was discovered that the so-called ldquoentry criteria was not being imposed on other students.Even after an Education and Health Care Plan review stated that she should be included at this school a number of obstacles have been put in her way which her family believe are clear attempts to humiliate Ciara and to sicken them: she must repeat previous years must leave at lunchtime on certain days and was then refused aafter the half-term break because a teaching assistant couldnrsquot be found. Following a legal letter from the local authority the school has now reluctantly agreed to let herbut she must not mix with her th year peers, even at lunchtimes.Parents of Downrsquos Syndrome children all over the UK will recognise several aspects of this story. They arise from a refusal to recognise them as fully human or as being somehow less than fully-deserving of our public services. When we allow a personrsquos basic human dignity to be so easily stripped away due to disability, ill health and old age none of us will eventually escape the natural consequences of this.During Downrsquos Syndrome Awareness weeks we all become sentimental on social media when photographs are posted of smiling, happy children surrounded by love and we duly pitch in with touching messages of support. Yet a curious dissonance exists here in our attitudes to people with Downrsquos Syndrome. Wersquore all happy to sign up to an agenda which supports their basic human rights to be treated equally and as fully human yet seem quite happy to have Downrsquos Syndrome effectively screened out of existence in our modern, inclusive and enlightened world.The charity Donrsquot Screen Us Out has highlighted government figures indicating that % of babies who are prenatally diagnosed with Downrsquos Syndrome are aborted.Based on the most recent figures for Downrsquos births, this is projected to result in a decline of % reported live births of babies with Downrsquos.According to the charity, ldquothese consequences would have a profound long-term effect on the population of the Downrsquos Syndrome community, and enable a kind of informal eugenics in which certain kinds of disabled people are effectively lsquoscreened outrsquo of the population before they are even born.This is not a debate about abortion, rather itrsquos one about who gets to decide what it means to be fully human and how much we erode the rights of those that society deems to be something less. If we can get to a situation where Downrsquos Syndrome is regarded as such an imposition on our nice, normal way of le that we are screening it out of existence then what are the care and spending implications for those Downrsquos Syndrome people who made it to birth  And once we start quantying the human value of these, our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, then when do we start coming for the aged, infirm and handicapped on grounds of cost and convenience "},{"url":null,"title":"university-plea-to-scottish-government-over-pensions-black-hole","story":"A joint letter from Universities Scotland and the UCU lecturersrsquos union highlights ldquograve concerns following the proposed amendments to public sector pensions by the UK Treasury.The changes impact on the Scottish Teachersrsquo Pension Scheme used by universities north of the Border.The letter states: ldquoYou will know that our organisations have been raising with you and your colleagues our belief in the need for the Scottish Government to make investments additional to the Scottish Budget to support the success of higher education and its contribution to Scotlandrsquos progress.ldquoThe unfunded increase in pension costs faced by Scottish higher education institutions is very dficult to meet from a flat-cash budget settlement.ldquoWe are deeply concerned that this cost will impact detrimentally on students and staff in Scottish universities.The letter says universities have now received notication from the Scottish Public Pensions Agency that the employer contribution to the Scottish scheme will increase even more steeply than expected, rising from . per cent of salary to  per cent from  September this year.It goes on to call for the Scottish Government to use additional money from Westminster that is part of the UK-wide Budget process -

This contributed to improved outcomes for children.“Responses indicated that parents were very happy with the service, commenting very positively about the care and support their child was given. and said the staff were very supportive of the whole family.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Feedback from last years participants was overwhelmingly positive.\"  Safety course for bikers viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"final countdown to run garioch","story":"Nearly , runners will be putting the finishing touches to their training this week in preparation for Run Garioch on Sunday.Inverurie’s biggest sporting event – with six dferent races, all based at the Garioch Sports Centre – will start with record numbers setting off in the eGroup k at .am.From am to pm there’ll be free activities for the whole family in the eGroup Event Village, including inflatables, football games, a climbing wall, and, new for this year, a Karaoke car.Run Garioch’s retail partner Runit will be on hand selling kit and race day essentials and there’ll be displays from community groups like Colony Park football club, the Inverurie Youth Sports Foundation and Ecosse Northboats Inverurie Cycle Club throughout the day.Catering in the eGroup Event Village will open at am, with Run Garioch’s two Inverurie-based catering partners both making a welcome .Davidsons Butchers of Inverurie will be sparking up the BBQ with burgers, bacon rolls and other favourites local social enterprise Fly Cup will be offering hot drinks, scones, pancakes, homebakes, soup and rolls in the catering marquee.

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up. Will she use her office to ensure that the potential for marine renewable energy generation is fully recognised when that white paper comes to publication #Responding on behalf of the government the energy minister, Claire Perry MP, said: “I don’t want to pre-empt the white paper, but one of the things we will show in that is how the ongoing attempts to be technology neutral to try and work across the piece to generate low cost, low carbon and highly competitive technologies will be part of that. We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland. If the minister is committed to what she said about the policy now being ‘technology neutral’ then marine renewables should get a fair chance to be heard.“With a little more understanding and investment from central government, I believe we will soon reach a point where this industry can support itself, and provide stable, well paid and skilled jobs for many in Orkney and Shetland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters. They know what they are talking about and have genuine concerns about whether food standards will be eroded as a result of cheaper imports. The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A public consultation is to follow later this yearThe consultation contains proposals around the use of one of two member wards, where a ward includes an inhabited island — an option made available under new islands legislation — as well as looking at the boundaries of wards.As part of the review, the public#s views will be asked for this summer.Responding to the launch of the consultation, a spokeswoman for Orkney Islands Council explained that, the commission are not recommending changes to the number of councillors but have proposed some changes to ward boundaries. Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those behind the charity said it is well-known that men find it harder to admit to problems and seek help at an early stage, but the camaraderie of the Men’s Shed is helping to overcome this resistance.Despite the success of Orkney Men’s Shed and the growing popularity of the movement across Scotland, Mr McArthur suggested that they remain a “largely unsung success story”.  The MSP described the work the organisation does as “le-changing” for its members, providing a sense of purpose and an opportunity to make friends and share company.Speaking after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “The Men’s Shed movement has been a tremendous success over recent years with the number of Sheds and ‘Shedders’ across the country continuing to grow. This is illustrated perfectly in Orkney, where the local Men’s Shed is going from strength to strength, with membership up to  and plans for expansion of the shed in Finstown.“Every Men’s Sheds is dferent, of course, but all provide a place to work and relax, pursue hobbies, share skills, have a cuppa and a chat and get practical help with projects. This should not disguise, however, the real impact Men’s Sheds can and do have. Increasingly it is recognised that these facilities make a tangible dference in efforts to tackle loneliness, social isolation and mental ill health.“Last month, I urged the government to look at the case for allowing Men’s Sheds to bid in for health and wider social care funding. This is the approach in Australia, where the movement started, and there are strong arguments for assessingthe same might be done in this country. This could help sustain and expand Men’s Sheds, providing more people in Scotland with the chance to access the many benefits they deliver”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A total of , out of , participants in the study had developed dementia by . A north south ide in Scotland in the quality of drinking water was also revealed, with the North East coming out worst and the Borders and South West coming out on top. Coagulants such as alumare used to trap impurities in raw water by binding them together to form particles before they are filtered out. Fluoride occurs naturally and is not added to the water supply in Scotland. Researchers say there is some evidence that it increases the human absorption of aluminium. Study author, Dr Tom Russ from the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh, stressed that the low levels of aluminium and fluoride found in the water in Scotland were “very good” in relation to World Health Organisation guidelines. “Everybody included in the study was alive in  and they were all born in ,” he said. “Everybody who subsequently died with dementia was compared with those who died without, and the people who lived in areas of higher levels of aluminium in drinking water were more likely to die than those in areas where the aluminium levels were lower. “We still see this well accepted finding that higher levels of aluminium in particular are associated with an increased risk of dementia.

A land where  per cent voted to remain in the European Union. Our voice has been ignored.“But it is not merely our voice that has been ignored - but the voice of the  percent who voted remain across the UK has been ignored.“And the voice of those wanting to leave but who could never have contemplated the maze that Brexit has become. Their voice is being ignored as well.“My message is for every European national living in the UK, in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland.

But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm history unmasks brexit fellow traveller corbyn","story":"Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are hugely fond of making the claim that the Labour leader has always been on the right side of history.Whether defending him against troubling questions about his associations with representatives of sundry terrorist organisations or explaining why he could so often be found voting against past Labour governments, Corbynistas frequently rely on the line that their man has always had right on his side.This revisionist takemight baffle non-believers, but for those who have emotionally invested themselves in the Leader of the Opposition, it’s more than enough to allow them to maintain the fantasy that he is a paragon of moral purity.I wonder how many of those supporters will – after yesterday’s extraordinary march in London in support of a second EU referendum – have the decency to, at least, die a little inside the next time they parrot this claptrap about the man who would be prime minister.Corbyn’s boycott of yesterday’s protest is nothing less than a betrayal of the very people – the vulnerable, the poorly paid, the powerless – who will be hit hardest by the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union. What’s more, it’s a betrayal of his own party which – in theory, at least – is in favour of another referendum on EU membership as a way of breaking the deadlock on the question.Corbyn’s closest political ally, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, explained that the reason he could not bring himself to attend yesterday’s event was that by doing so he might “alienate” some of the people he wanted to “bring on board”. Maybe this was good enough for the faithful, but it really shouldn’t have been.On every political issue, there will always be those who take opposing views. If we apply McDonnell logic, those with whom a politician disagrees should never be challenged. Can you imagine a Corbynista arguing against protesting against, let’s say, restrictions on trade union rights on the grounds that to do so might alienate those who are in favour  No, of course you can’t.Across the broader left, arguments against participation in yesterday’s march were no less infantile.On Friday, Jonathon Shafi, co-counder of the Radical Independence Campaign, tweeted a list of participants in the march. These included Tories such as Michael Heseltine, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve and Liberal Democrats Vince Cable and Jo Swinson. “How anyone on the left can countenance supporting this,” he wrote, “I have no idea.”One could easily draw up a list of those opposed to the objective of yesterday’s protest – Prime Minister Theresa May, for example, and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage – and ask how anyone on the left could countenance not participating in the march.The hard left – the Jeremy Corbyn left – has long been every bit as Eurosceptic \u2028as the right. They’re just less honest about it.Corbyn’s pitully weak role in the Remain campaign in  confirmed what anyone who had paid the slightest attention to his career already knew. He believed the EU was a malign force. Corbyn’s absence from yesterday’s march was not because there were Tories there and nor because he feared alienating Leavers, he was not there because he is the left cheek of the anti-EU arse. It is as simple as that.And so, as has become a modern tradition, it fell to Corbyn’s deputy – Tom Watson – to stand up for the values the Labour Party is supposed to hold dear.Treating his leader with the contempt he deserves, Watson said he was backing a second referendum as the only way to solve the Brexit crisis.He would be participating in – and speaking at – the Put It To The People march because the current parliamentary impasse was not working for either Leavers or Remainers.“I’ve come to the reluctant view that the only way to resolve this, and have legitimacy in the eyes of the public, is for the people themselves to sign it off,” said Watson. The only chance of bringing the country back together was, he added, to give everyone a “final say” and then live with the result.To the screeching fury chimps who pollute the internet with abuse of anyone who dares criticise Corbyn, this will have been further confirmation that Watson is impure. I mean, he went on a march with Heseltine – he must be a wrong ’un, mustn’t he The SNP has often deployed the “standing with Tories” missile to attack Labour politicians who oppose Scottish independence but, yesterday, senior nationalists – including party leader Nicola Sturgeon – were happy to do precisely that.Sturgeon and her colleagues could find it within themselves to unite with political opponents in pursuit of a common goal, but for adherents of the Church of Corbyn such pragmatism is heresy.MPs may have voted to reject a No Deal Brexit – and even Corbyn says such a scenario would be a mistake – but unless they can agree an alternative that’s acceptable to the EU, it remains a distinct possibility.Corbyn supporters might indulge the fantasy he can win an election that hasn’t actually been called and then strike a deal which works for the UK, but the reality is that they are fellow travellers– whether they like it or not – of such Tory Brexiteers as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Dominic Raab. They are standing by, doing nothing, while Brexit looms, threatening jobs and diminishing the UK in the eyes of the rest of the world. That’s not a display of moral courage but of craven capitulation.Corbyn’s leadership –one can characterise it as such – of the Labour Party has been quite the rollercoaster ride. Elected as the champion of a new, gentler, kinder, more compassionate politics, he was long ago exposed as a drab, unpleasant little man whose ideas were forged – and remain – in the foreign country of the past. Supporters may tell themselves his boycott of yesterday’s march was a display of integrity but, in fact, it was just the latest in a long line of moments when Jeremy Corbyn was on the wrong side of history.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"traitor to england ian blackford harassed by brexit supporters in london","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The SNP#s Westminster leader Ian Blackford was harassed by a group of Brexit supporters who shouted abuse at him as he walked down Whitehall.Mr Blackford and fellow SNP MP Stephen Gethins were leaving the Cabinet Office shortly after pm following a meeting to discuss Brexit with minister David Lidington.window.twttr : Brexit: EU leaders open door to long delay as May fails to set out plan B.\u2028A group of around a dozen people followed Mr Blackford, shouting “traitor to England” and “leave means leave”.Media interviews that were scheduled to take place outside the Cabinet Office had to be abandoned.

Organisers claim up to one million took part. The EU has agreed to extend the UK’s originally scheduled departure this Friday, but with May’s deal poised to be rejected again, the situation remains mired in uncertainty.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s absence from the People’s Vote march yesterday was widely criticised and underlined the lack of consensus on a way forward on the constitutional impasse.Sturgeon received widespread cheers as she addressed the campaigners in Parliament Square yesterday afternoon. “Parliament should take back control,” she said.“Scotland – the land where more than  per cent of people voted to remain in the European Union – our voice has been ignored.”Sturgeon added: “Today we make our voices heard. And what our voices are saying loudly and clearly is this: Put it back to the people.”Watson was the only senior Labour figure at the rally and pledged to back a People’s Vote, amid concerns that Corbyn remains unconvinced. “We are one million strong,” Watson said.“Prime Minister, you’ve lost control of this process, you’re plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control.”Khan said it was “time to withdraw Article ”.He added: “it’s time to give us, the British people, a final say on Brexit.”Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson joined protesters, along with senior Tories Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening, as well as Anna Soubry of the recently founded Independent Group at Westminster and Green MP Caroline Lucas.The House of Commons may get the opportunity to vote on a second referendum this week, despite a recent Commons vote which saw the proposalheavily defeated by  votes to , when Labour abstained.However, even with every Labour MP voting in favour, the bid for a new referendum would have failed, meaning Conservative opponents of a People’s Vote must be convinced to change their minds, or at least abstain, for it to have any hope of being approved by Parliament.Senior figures in the SNP and Labour said they have spoken to Tories who previously rejected a People’s Vote, but are now willing to allow it to pass the Commons.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said a number of Conservative MPs had privately told him they supported a second EU referendum, but would only vote in favour once Labour is committed and a People’s Vote is likely to win Commons approval.“It is the right thing to do to go back to the people, and I actually believe thatwe had that unity across the opposition benches, that would put pressure on a number of Conservatives,” Blackford said.“A number of Conservatives say they want that to happen as well, but they do that privately, but they won’t break publicly.”Opposition leaders met with Corbyn this week and emerged disappointed, saying he insisted that a public vote could only be calledLabour’s proposed Brexit deal was on the ballot.A senior Labour MP told Scotland on Sunday that the internal battle over a second referendum was being won by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who back a People’s Vote, over Corbyn and his official spokesman, Seumas Milne – both of whom hold Eurosceptic views.“When it comes to a People’s Vote, it’s Starmer and McDonnell vs Milne and Corbyn. Bit by bit, we’re shting things slowly inside the party so that their views are irrelevant and their position becomes untenable,” said the frontbench MP.They added: “There are Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to who will abstain when it comes to another vote.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2108-21-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The airport is to increase the number of security lanes from six to eight by Easter.Belfast International Airport has been approached for comment on the ranking of its lounge.A Which  Inspector was less than impressed with what the airports lounge had to offer.\"We were particularly looking forward to the sumptuous buffet, imagining all sorts of treats that might be available,\" the Inspector said. \"What we found was that the buffets ‘hot selection’ was just a single soup: sweet potato and butternut that was bland.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit is not possible to fully consider the merits of the case at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down in pole position

the spoils and it took a point in added time from Donal OrsquoHare to kill off a game Carlow offering in a controversial conclusion to the game.Three minutes injury-time had been played when Diarmuid Walshe converted a free to tie the game for the home side.With the home fans waiting on the final whistle, play was allowed to continue and OrsquoHare was again Downrsquos saviour with a last-gasp winner.The game was far from being a classic with referee, James Bermingham, booking five Carlow players and seven from Down before issuing red to Shane Redmond from the home county and Kevin McKiernan and Paul Devlin from Down.Carlow led - to - at the interval with Darragh Foley using the wind well in the half landing six points from placed balls.Down used the elements to their advantage after the break and points from Paul Devlin, Conor Poland, Darren OrsquoHagan and OrsquoHare had the visitors in the ascendancy.Carlow then hit back with Eoghan Ruth pouncing on a loose ball in the

He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free.

It said that there were a series of glaring inaccuracies in the department’s calculations and that there was virtually no cost dference between the cost of wood pellets and LPG for Moy Park’s farmers, who get discounted gas through the poultry processor.The group said that there were then multiple other factors – such as the increased maintenance costs of the complex biomass systems and the increased electricity costs to run them – which made fossil fuels more attractive.Jamie Kidney from wood pellet distributor kWh Supply told the News Letter that he had spoken to one installer of gas boilers which in recent weeks had quoted for the replacement of over  biomass systems. He said that he was aware of another boiler installer which had quoted for a similar number of reversions to fossil fuels.This week there was concern in the House of Lords about whether they should be relying on data from the department which has consistently presided over RHI being a mess since its launch more than six years ago.Mr Kidney said: “The information that DfE peddle is factually incorrect. Their arguments that attempt to justy the dference between RHI tarf of £, in Northern Ireland and £, in Great Britain are nonsensical.“Biomass boilers were all supplied from Europe and they did not cost less in Northern Ireland than in Britain. DfE’s assertion about the cost of fuel is equally illogical.“Incompetence was clearly demonstrated in the structuring and administering of the RHI to the extent that it merited a public inquiry. It is absurd that the department central to the whole fiasco should now be entrusted with the responsibility for the future of the RHI in Northern Ireland.”Meanwhile, no one in government has been able to provide any clarity about what the concession made by the government to get the RHI cuts through the House of Lords will mean.On Tuesday night, NIO minister Lord Duncan persuaded Lord Empey to drop a bid to delay the cuts – a proposal which had support from all sides of the House of Lords – after proposing an independent chairman to examine each case of hardship by RHI claimants.When asked by the News Letter how that would operate, the NIO offered no comment. Stormont’s Department for the Economy said it was “currently considering the issue” andwould give details “in due course”.Sam McBride: Banner backlash is a foretaste of a looming dilemma for

But the consultants draft stage  report clearly states what weve all known for many years ndash which is that a by-pass must be part of any solution.\"There have been those who claim the Welsh Government dont have the funds for a bypass road.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

A Vale wide mph limit on all urban and residential roads would greatly increase the safety, health and well-being of residents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

Irsquove recently had money for junction  of the M but I donrsquot have additional fundingfor this.Rod Harrod, chairman of the Dinas Powys Bypass Steering Group, said the bypass plans are ldquomore advanced now than at any time in the last  or even  years.Mr Harrod said improvements to the Merrie Harrier junction would benefit staff, patients, and visitors at Llandough Hospital.Councillors said there could be some competition for Welsh Government funding for the bypass from the proposed works on junction  of the M.Cllr Andrew Robertson, who represents Dinas Powys, said he couldnrsquot understand why there had to be competition for funding with the M scheme.ldquoIf the traffic situation in Dinas Powys is resolved it would benefit every community across the South Wales, Vale of Glamorgan corridor, Cllr Robertson said.Cllr Gwyn John urged the campaign to keep going despite the delays.He said: ldquoI can appreciate how frustrated people involved are with the delays.ldquo[The bypass] is a must. With all the development we have got across the Vale of Glamorgan itrsquos chocka-block. Itrsquos getting worse.ldquoDonrsquot give up, get stuck in. Itrsquos going to be a battle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
